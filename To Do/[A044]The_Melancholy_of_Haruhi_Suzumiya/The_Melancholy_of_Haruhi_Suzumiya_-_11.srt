1
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,666
[gasping]

2
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,875
[gasping]

3
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,833
I don't think you
should move him.

4
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,625
[ARAKAWA]
The master's dead.

5
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,791
It's a fruit knife.

6
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,958
[KYON]
This is definitely not good.

7
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,958
[door creaks]

8
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,750
[KOIZUMI]
Hm.

9
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,958
The knife went all the way
through the notebook.

10
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,250
At least one
thing's for certain:

11
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,083
whoever did this
must be really strong.

12
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,083
[KYON] If that's the case,
then another thing's certain.

13
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,458
The culprit has to be a man.

14
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,916
And since we haven't seen
Mr. Yutaka Tamaru around today,

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,250
well...

16
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,750
What do you wanna do
about your little sister?

17
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,375
I don't want her to know
anything about this.

18
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:42,250
It looks as if we have a real
mystery on our hands here.

19
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:46,916
In fact, what we have
is a closed circle.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,791
First impressions are
that this is a murder.

21
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,333
We have a room where
the door and windows

22
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:54,541
are locked from the inside.

23
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,208
Now then, if the room was
locked when we got to it,

24
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,375
how did the killer enter
the room, commit the crime,

25
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,833
and then leave the scene?

26
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,541
Uh. Kyon, did
something bad happen?

27
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,875
[KYON]
I told you already.

28
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,541
Mr. Keiichi got sick and
he's resting in his room.

29
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,541
So we have to stay here, okay?

30
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,833
So, is Mikuru sick?

31
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,916
[whimpering]

32
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,208
[HARUHI]
Kyon, can we talk?

33
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,666
[HARUHI]
Yuki, lock the door.

34
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,666
And don't open it for anyone,
no matter what. Got that?

35
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,458
I understand.

36
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,666
[HARUHI]
Do you think he was murdered?

37
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,125
[KYON]
That's what it looks like.

38
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,208
[HARUHI]
Oh, this is nuts.

39
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,916
I never thought something like
this would ever really happen.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,333
[KYON]
But all you keep saying

41
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,666
is how badly you wanted
something mysterious to happen.

42
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,916
[HARUHI]
Well, yeah,

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,458
because I never really
thought it would happen!

44
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,041
[KYON] A murder happens
in a locked room

45
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,458
on a deserted island in
the middle of a typhoon.

46
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,375
What're the chances we'd stumble
onto something like that

47
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,750
while on vacation?

48
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,333
Then again,

49
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:39,250
maybe this is happening because
Haruhi wished for it to happen.

50
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,875
We're in some really
big trouble, aren't we?

51
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,291
[KYON] Right now, she looks
like a mischievous little boy,

52
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:49,166
worried about how an April Fools
joke went from bad to worse.

53
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,666
I hate to say this, but as far
as prime suspects go,

54
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,750
Mr. Yutaka is front and center.

55
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,083
No one knows where he is. It's
like he just up and vanished.

56
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,291
[HARUHI]
Hey, wait a minute.

57
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,666
Yesterday, Mikuru
told me something.

58
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,625
[KYON'S SISTER giggling]

59
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,375
[HARUHI]
Don't let it hit the water!

60
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,708
Nice! Here comes another one!

61
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,750
[KYON]
She saw them arguing?

62
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,541
[HARUHI] That's what
it looked like anyway.

63
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,041
And last night,
I overheard something.

64
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,000
Remember? I went to the
bathroom during the game.

65
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,458
I was standing
in this same spot.

66
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,041
[YUTAKA]
Yeah, I'm in a hurry.

67
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,750
Get my passport and
traveler's checks ready, okay?

68
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,458
[HARUHI]
Now I know what that was about.

69
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,041
I'll bet you anything
that he was arranging

70
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,875
his escape overseas.

71
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,666
[KYON]
But what about the sealed room?

72
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,041
He wasn't trying to fake
Mr. Keiichi's suicice,

73
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,583
so what's the point in locking
up the room like that?

74
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,250
[HARUHI]
Hm.

75
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,041
I can't just stand here and
not do anything. Come on.

76
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,708
We're gonna go take a closer
look in Mr. Keiichi's room.

77
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,833
I'm sorry. I called
the police already,

78
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,375
and they insisted that no one
is allowed inside the room

79
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,166
until they arrive on the island.

80
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,958
Did they say when
they would get here?

81
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,750
I checked the forecast,
and right now,

82
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,750
it looks like the weather
will start clearing up

83
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,333
by tomorrow afternoon.

84
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,458
It's safe to assume that the
police will arrive around then.

85
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,541
[HARUHI] Was his door
locked all night long?

86
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,125
[ARAKAWA]
I have no idea.

87
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,500
When I saw that the door
was closed, I knocked.

88
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,041
[HARUHI]
And that's it?

89
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,000
[ARAKAWA] Mr. Keiichi keeps
important work related documents

90
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,416
in there, and it was
forbidden to open the door

91
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,708
if he didn't answer it.

92
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,791
He was very adamant about that.

93
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,416
So Mr. Keiichi and Mr. Yutaka

94
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,416
didn't get alone
with each other?

95
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,166
I really wouldn't know
anything about that.

96
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,041
There are many things
regarding those two

97
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,416
with which I am not familiar.

98
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,916
You see, Ms. Mori and myself

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,833
have been employed here at
the mansion for only one week.

100
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,208
[HARUHI, KYON]
Only a week?

101
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,583
Ms. Mori and myself
are working part time

102
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,583
as Mr. Keiichi's
temporary maid and butler.

103
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,583
Our contract with him was brief.

104
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:42,875
It was to last a mere
two weeks out of the summer.

105
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,041
So, you two were just
hired to work here

106
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,250
and you never worked
for him before this?

107
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,583
Precisely.

108
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,875
As for the relationship
between the two brothers,

109
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,625
all I know is that
Mr. Yutaka was an employee

110
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,875
in Mr. Keiichi's company.

111
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,875
[KYON]
Something's not right.

112
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,500
[KYON] I've suddenly got a
strange feeling about this.

113
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,791
[HARUHI]
Mm. Uh.

114
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,541
Koizumi! What're you doing?

115
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,583
[KOIZUMI] I was just having
a look around the mansion.

116
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,833
I can't find Mr. Yutaka
anywhere. How 'bout you?

117
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,708
[HARUHI] I'm going outside to
see if the boat's still there.

118
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,583
[MORI] I don't think
you'll find the boat.

119
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,000
What do you mean?

120
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,750
Well, late last night,
I noticed that Mr. Yutaka seemed

121
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,500
as if he were in an awful hurry.

122
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,833
I saw him heading for
the front entrance.

123
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,875
[KOIZUMI] Then, are you implying
that Mr. Yutaka took the boat

124
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,333
and left the island?

125
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,000
[MORI] I'm not positive
that's what happened, no.

126
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,958
But that was the last
time I saw Mr. Yutaka.

127
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,333
About what time?

128
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,666
I believe it was around
one o'clock in the morning.

129
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,416
[KYON] One wrong step and
we'll both fall off the cliff.

130
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,625
Oh well, even if we
fall, when I'm with her,

131
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,041
I feel like my chances for
survival are pretty good.

132
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,500
Kyon, do you see that?

133
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,541
[KYON]
The boat's gone.

134
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,541
So Mr. Yutaka did it after all.

135
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,625
[KYON]
Grey skies and black seas,

136
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:12,791
it reminds me of being
inside a closed space.

137
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,125
There's no way
I'd ever get used to

138
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,000
a monochromatic world like this.

139
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,208
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

140
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,916
Someone's there! See!
Just past the rocks!

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,541
I wonder if somebody else
is out there looking.

142
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,041
Or maybe that's the--
the-- the murderer!

143
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,500
[KYON]
Haruhi! Wait!

144
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,166
Hey. Are you sure you saw
him come down this way?

145
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,666
[HARUHI] He had to.
This is the only path.

146
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,833
[HARUHI yelping]

147
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,125
[KYON]
Haruhi!

148
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,583
Kyon.

149
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,583
Kyon! Kyon!

150
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,125
Are you all right?
Are you alive?

151
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,541
Yeah, I guess I'm okay.

152
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,041
[HARUHI] Looks like
we're in a tough spot.

153
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,000
[KYON]
Yeah.

154
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't think we can
make it back to the path.

155
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,083
[HARUHI]
Hey, over there.

156
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,625
[KYON] Forunately, it was
warm inside the cave.

157
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,583
Was it just the Earth's heat?

158
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,125
Or was there an underground
hot spring near by?

159
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,791
I know I saw a
shadow back there.

160
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,708
[KYON]
You sure it was even a person?

161
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,541
I mean, maybe it
was something else.

162
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,375
[HARUHI]
No way. I saw what I saw.

163
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,125
Although, I was thinking...

164
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,500
Hey, Kyon. 

165
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:35,208
Do you really think
Mr. Yutaka killed Mr. Keiichi?

166
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,500
[KYON]
What're you getting at?

167
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,875
Well, I've just been
thinking about everything.

168
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,333
According to what Ms. Mori
said a little while ago,

169
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,625
Mr. Yutaka left the island
around one in the morning.

170
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,958
When we found Mr. Keiichi's
body, I touched him.

171
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,833
He was still warm. You see
what I'm getting at?

172
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,333
His body was still warm. That
means Mr. Keiichi was killed

173
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,750
right before we found his body.

174
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,166
So what does that mean?

175
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,958
Mr. Yutaka left
the mansion at night

176
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,125
in the middle of a typhoon,

177
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,083
hid till morning,
then stabbed Mr. Keiichi

178
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,916
before splitting the island?

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,791
[HARUHI] But I don't think
that's how it happened.

180
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,791
Look, even if
Mr. Keiichi was killed

181
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,500
an hour before we found him,

182
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,125
that means someone should've
seen or heard something.

183
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,291
Remember, we were all awake and
wandering around the place.

184
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,958
Someone should've
heard something.

185
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,416
A sound. A scream.

186
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,791
[KYON]
Don't you think that's strange?

187
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,041
I mean, you really think

188
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,958
that Mr. Keiichi stayed
alive for hours on end

189
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,625
and managed to lock himself in
his room after beind stabbed?

190
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,666
Think about it.

191
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,000
If Mr. Yutaka
wasn't the murderer,

192
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:29,625
then why'd he run--?

193
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,666
Wait! I got it!

194
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,333
Now I've got it. I know
what happened in there.

195
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,291
[KYON sighs]

196
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,916
Are you even listening to me?

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,833
[KYON] Yeah. Come on
then, let's hear it.

198
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,416
I'm sure Mr. Yutaka's the
one who stabbed Mr. Keiichi.

199
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,291
Like you said, why else
would he run away

200
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,291
unless he was
the guy that did it.

201
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,875
[KYON]
Yeah, that's true.

202
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,041
[HARUHI] So Mr. Yutaka stabbed
Mr. Keiichi, we know that,

203
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,791
but how did it happen?

204
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,458
I'm pretty sure
it was an accident.

205
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,083
They were arguing.
Mr. Yutaka lost his temper,

206
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,250
picked up the fruit knife,
started waving it around,

207
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,458
and bam!

208
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,166
But the knife didn't
go all the way through

209
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,625
to Mr. Keiichi's heart.

210
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,416
[HARUHI]
The notebook stopped the knife.

211
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,875
It was stuck in him,
but it wasn't fatal.

212
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,625
Here's where it
gets complicated.

213
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,166
Mr. Keiichi went into shocked

214
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,416
and passed out right
there on the spot.

215
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,791
When that happened,

216
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,708
Mr. Yutaka though he'd killed
his brother and ran.

217
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,541
Now comes the tricky part.

218
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,333
Mr. Keiichi, who wasn't dead,

219
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,291
stayed unconscious
throughout the night

220
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,375
and came to the next morning.

221
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,083
When he woke up,
Mr. Keiichi was in a daze.

222
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,166
He stood up, but his legs
were a little wobbly.

223
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,291
He remembered how his
brother tried to kill him,

224
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,250
so he staggered over to
the door to lock himself in.

225
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,375
This part's the
most tragic of all.

226
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,291
Mr. Keiichi, still dazed,
trippped over his own feet

227
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,791
and fell face down on the floor.

228
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,708
The weight of his body pushed
the knife up into his heart,

229
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,500
and that's what caused
Mr. Keiichi's death.

230
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,791
That's how it happened.

231
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,125
Wait a minute.

232
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,166
You honeslty think it all
went down that smoothly?

233
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,375
What're gonna do?
That's the way it happened.

234
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,166
Unless you've got a better idea.

235
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,875
I'm sure Mr. Yutaka would know 

236
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,875
if he really killed
his brother or not.

237
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,916
Besides, when we got to him,
Mr. Keiichi was lying face up.

238
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,791
If everything happened
the way that you said,

239
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,625
we would've found Mr. Keiichi
lying face down, not face up.

240
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,958
[HARUHI]
Well, that's true, but...

241
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,416
No... No wait!

242
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,750
If that's how it
really happened, then--!

243
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,541
[KYON]
Hey, what's wrong?

244
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,083
[HARUHI]
Uh. Oh, nothing.

245
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,000
I guess I wasn't thinking
straight there for a second.

246
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,083
[KYON]
Hm?

247
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,708
[KOIZUMI]
Hey! Can you hear me?

248
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,458
You guys okay?

249
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,208
[KYON] It looks like
Haruhi's deduction

250
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,541
has completely crumbled.

251
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,916
But if that's the case,
what really happened?

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,541
Mr. Yutaka wasn't on the
island when Mr. Keiichi died,

253
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,500
which means that somebody
else is the murderer here.

254
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,500
[plates clattering]

255
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,875
[KYON]
Hm?

256
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:04,333
[KYON'S SISTER]
Which one should I eat?

257
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,583
--[KYON] Hey.
--[KYON'S SISTER squeals]

258
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,375
[KYON'S SISTER]
Kyon, you scared me! Stop it!

259
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,875
Stealing food, eh?

260
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,833
[KYON'S SISTER grunts]

261
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,416
I was hungry. You're mean.

262
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,666
I'm sorry about that. 

263
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,416
I'll bring something up
to your room right away.

264
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,750
[KYON'S SISTER]
Hey, no fair.

265
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,500
Someone got to eat their
food before anyone else.

266
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,458
[MORI]
Yes, it was Mr. Arakawa.

267
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,458
He hasn't had a thing to
eat since this morning,

268
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,375
so I delivered his meal
ahead of everyone else.

269
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,958
You always find a way to
embarrass me, don't you?

270
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,000
[KYON'S SISTER whines]

271
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,041
[KYON]
Huh?

272
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,625
[KYON'S SISTER]
Is somethin' wrong?

273
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,833
[HARUHI]
Yuki, it's me. Open the door.

274
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,458
[NAGATO] I was told to not
open the door for anyone.

275
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,458
But it's okay now. Open up!

276
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,458
[NAGATO] Then I would be
opening the door for someone.

277
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,625
I was told not to
open it for anyone.

278
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,291
I take it Ms. Asahina's
still unconscious in there.

279
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,958
I'd assume she is,
otherwise, we'd hear her.

280
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,458
[HARUHI]
Yuki, when I said anyone,

281
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,500
I meant anyone who isn't
a member of the SOS brigade.

282
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,541
I mean, we're all
members, right?

283
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,166
[NAGATO]
That is not what I was told.

284
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,000
I was given an order
to lock this door

285
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,083
and under no circumstances
was I to open it for anyone.

286
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,625
But, Yuki, you
didn't say anything

287
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,916
when I left the room
a little while ago.

288
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,166
[NAGATO] My orders did not
specify the door being opened

289
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,833
from inside this room.

290
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,708
[KYON]
Hey, Nagato.

291
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:23,125
As of right now, Haruhi's
order has been retracted.

292
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,875
If you want, I'll just
give you a new order.

293
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,125
Look, my sister's out here.
Please open the door.

294
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,791
[HARUHI] Jeez, you don't have
to be so literal all the time.

295
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,833
[KYON] Maybe that was Nagato's
way of playing a joke on us.

296
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,333
Come on, Nagato.

297
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,875
No expression. Not even a blush?
Your face never changes.

298
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,000
You can't be serious
all the time, can you?

299
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,250
[KYON'S SISTER]
Thanks, Yuki!

300
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,208
What do you think
we should do now?

301
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,916
Do you wanna keep trying to find
the answers to this mystery?

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,333
Not anymore.

303
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,208
I guess I'm not the great
detective I thought I was.

304
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,458
Oh, well. We'll let the
police handle this one.

305
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,333
[door clicks]

306
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,333
I see. So that's what you were
talkin' about in the cave.

307
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,000
But something's strange.

308
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,125
If she really wanted to
play the detective so much,

309
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,375
why did she just suddenly drop
the whole thing like that?

310
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,291
I think I can understand that.

311
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,666
Or at least, where
she's comin' from.

312
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,416
Would you like to hear
my theory about it?

313
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,875
Yeah. I'm all ears.

314
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:28,958
Up to a certain point,

315
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,958
Ms. Suzumiya's
deductions are correct,

316
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,750
but the last part of the mystery
is where she got it wrong.

317
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,500
Mr. Keiichi was
stabbed by Mr. Yutaka.

318
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,875
However, he didn't
die right away.

319
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,416
Mr. Yutaka thought he
killed him, so he fled.

320
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,166
That's all correct.

321
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,291
But Mr. Keiichi came to because
of our knocking and shouts.

322
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,250
And just before we
tried opening the door,

323
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,250
he staggered over,
dazed, and locked it.

324
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:52,833
And then...

325
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,625
[bang]

326
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,375
[gasps]

327
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,166
That was the moment the knife
was pushed through the notebook

328
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,541
and into Mr. Keiichi's body.

329
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,791
In other words,
he was really killed...

330
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,208
...by the people who
rammed the door in.

331
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:12,000
Basically, it was
me and it was you

332
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,833
and it was also Mr. Arakawa.

333
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,833
I'm positive Ms. Suzumiya
figured all that out,

334
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,416
and that's why she
didn't say anything.

335
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,791
She was protecting us.

336
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,000
That's why she decided to keep

337
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,458
the truth of this
case to herself.

338
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:33,000
[KYON] Your theory does
make a lot of sense.

339
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,916
But it's unfortunate you had
to figure out the truth.

340
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,166
All I have to do is
keep you quiet,

341
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,208
and this whole thing goes away.

342
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,750
No one will ever know.
Isn't that right?

343
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:49,541
Someone help me!
Help me! Help me!

344
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,833
It's Koizumi. 

345
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,666
I don't know who, but
somebody stabbed him

346
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,208
in the chest with
a knife, and he's dead!

347
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,500
What did you say?

348
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,541
Impossible!

349
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,000
[KYON'S SISTER]
Come on! Follow me!

350
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,041
Hurry! Hurry!

351
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,208
[HARUHI] I never thought
you'd be such a badass.

352
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,750
[KYON] Yeah. Well, just
keep your mouth shut,

353
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,541
and I won't have
to kill you, too.

354
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,958
Here's how it goes.

355
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,458
Mr. Yutaka snuck back
here and killed Koizumi.

356
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,583
Only a killer knows
their motive, right?

357
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,875
So we say that we thought
he seemed a little... off.

358
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,125
Yeah, he was acting weird.
That'll be the story.

359
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,125
[HARUHI] You think the police
would actually buy that?

360
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,541
[KYON]
Yeah, but first,

361
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,000
we're gonna have to stab
the corpse a few more times.

362
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,541
It'll make Mr. Yutaka
seem like a total psycho.

363
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,416
Here goes!

364
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,750
Wait!

365
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,791
Uh...

366
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,750
Well, it looks like
we've been found out.

367
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,166
The game's over and we lost.

368
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,833
It's true, you beat
us fair and square.

369
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:58,041
I'm sorry. I did it
'cause Kyon told me to.

370
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,916
Right. Now, Madame Haruhi,
supernatural genius

371
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,041
and number one sleuth,
will reveal the results

372
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,750
of her amazing detectiving.

373
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,000
[KYON] Why don'tcha pat yourself
on the back a little bit harder.

374
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,083
By now, it should be evident
that the murder mystery

375
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,666
was, in fact, an elaborate hoax 

376
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,750
designed and orchestrated by
Koizumi, the Tamaru brothers,

377
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,041
Mr. Arakawa, and Ms. Mori.

378
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,416
It was an impressive plot,

379
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,083
especially with that
red herring at the end.

380
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,666
Nice observation.

381
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,958
It was all in fun, though.

382
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,583
A surprise party with
a twist, if you will.

383
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,458
[KYON] I'm sure she knew what
was up right from the start.

384
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,083
I hate to admit it,

385
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,708
but in the beginning,
you guys had me going.

386
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,666
Until I got your fake solution
where Mr. Keiichi was killed

387
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,208
by Kyon and the boys
busted through the door.

388
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,958
But I realized something.

389
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,125
If he really did collide
with the door hard enough

390
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,791
to push the knife
through to his heart,

391
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,041
then the door should've had
blood or scratches on it.

392
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,875
But there wasn't anything like
that on the inside of the door.

393
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,541
[KYON]
I noticed that, thank you.

394
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,666
Okay, but you're talkin' about
a really sturdy door there.

395
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,708
I mean, I don't think that
gives you very much evidence

396
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,125
to suspect anything.

397
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,125
There were other
fishy things, as well.

398
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,541
Like the day when Koizumi
first met Mr. Arakawa.

399
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,833
He said, "I haven't
seen you in so long."

400
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,083
But Mr. Arakawa said he only
started working here a week ago,

401
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,166
so it would've been
the first time they met.

402
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,208
You are 100% correct.

403
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,833
[KYON]
I figured that one out, too.

404
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,041
There was also that time

405
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,583
when we all ran up to
Mr. Keiichi's room.

406
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,375
You headed right down the hall
to his door, right, Koizumi?

407
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,750
So how could you have
known which room was his?

408
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,291
You told us this
was the first time

409
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,166
you'd ever been here, remember?

410
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,083
I can't believe it.

411
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,041
Not just one, but two mistakes?

412
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,416
But that's not so strange.

413
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,291
He could've found out
which room was mine

414
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,541
while the rest of you were
off doing something else.

415
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,750
That is correct.

416
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,791
However, the final clue
was the empty plate

417
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,375
Kyon saw in the kitchen.

418
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,750
I'll let Kyon take this one, 

419
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,500
'cause I didn't
actually see the plate.

420
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,916
I noticed that Mr. Keiichi is
the only one on this island

421
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,666
who eats with a fork and knife
instead of chopsticks.

422
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,041
Of course, there's
the possibility

423
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,875
that Mr. Arakawa eats
with a fork and knife, too.

424
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,125
But, you see, the carrots
remained on the plate untouched.

425
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:05,041
That's when I realized that it
was actually Mr. Keiichi's meal.

426
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,750
If you add it all up, there's
only one conclusion to come to

427
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,958
and that is...

428
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,500
...there was never a
murder to begin with!

429
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:14,958
Mr. Keiichi was, is,
and always has been alive!

430
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,916
Wow!

431
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
[KYON]
I'm sure that, in her mind,

432
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,291
Haruhi's probably
hearing applause

433
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,666
that's 100 times
bigger than that.

434
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,583
So, we decided to
turn the tables

435
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,250
and put on a little
show of our own.

436
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,083
Then the fight I saw
on the balcony that day

437
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,750
was part of the act as well.

438
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,250
[KEIICHI]
That's right.

439
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:37,125
[YUTAKA] And that late night
phone call was a fake, too.

440
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,916
I was planning on lettin'
the cat out of the bag

441
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,291
at some point.

442
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,125
I'm still amazed you solved
the mystery so quickly.

443
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,416
Well, all of your sleuthing

444
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,625
caused their whole dasterdly
scheme to unravel,

445
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,583
that was some nice
detective work there.

446
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,625
Of course!

447
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,458
It's elementary, my dear Watson!

448
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,250
Elementary!

449
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,958
So all of this was something
your organization cooked up?

450
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,333
Yes. The Tamaru brothers,
Mr. Arakawa, and Ms. Mori

451
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,833
are all collegues of mine.

452
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,250
I told ya we'd have a blast!

453
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,833
[KOIZUMI] We believed it would
be best if Ms. Suzumiya

454
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,500
had a mystery to keep her mind
free of any strange thoughts,

455
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,791
if you know what I mean.

456
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,416
Well, you do.

457
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,250
Although, bringing your
sister along was not

458
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,750
a part of the plan.

459
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,791
I asked you at the beginning
of this trip and you told me

460
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,708
that the organization didn't
have anything to do with it.

461
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:23,708
Naturally!

462
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,000
I couldn't tell you the truth

463
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,583
about their involvement
right then.

464
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,833
If you don't mind me asking,

465
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:33,000
when did you catch
on to our scheme?

466
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,208
To tell you the truth,

467
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,791
I knew about it right
from the beginning.

468
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,791
[KOIZUMI]
Indeed.

469
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,666
An incident like this
could never happen.

470
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,250
Because there's no way that
Haruhi would ever really wish

471
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,041
for someone to be murdered.

472
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,750
That's just how she is.

473
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,750
[KOIZUMI] Then you really
trust Ms. Suzumiya, don't you?

474
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,041
And there's one more
thing that I wanna know.

475
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,791
Haruhi said she saw a shadow.

476
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,583
You had something to
do with that, right?

477
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,166
I don't know
anything about that.

478
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,750
I'm tellin' the truth!

479
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,291
The mystery solved, so there's
no reason for me to keep acting.

480
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,625
Well, she saw something.
What do you think it was?

481
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,083
Can't be...

482
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,958
Apparently, Ms. Suzumiya
wished for a murderer

483
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,375
that wasn't one of us, and that
was probably the shadow.

484
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,208
But if it was something Haruhi
wished for that came to life,

485
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,708
then...

486
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,458
Uh!

487
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,916
That means... there's some
kind of horrible... something

488
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,291
lurking on that
island right now.

489
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,416
Naw, it was probably
just the storm

490
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,916
that was making
Haruhi see things.

491
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,041
So, where do you wanna go next?

492
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,000
How about the Bermuda Triangle?

493
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,958
[KYON'S SISTER]
Is Bermuda really a triangle?
