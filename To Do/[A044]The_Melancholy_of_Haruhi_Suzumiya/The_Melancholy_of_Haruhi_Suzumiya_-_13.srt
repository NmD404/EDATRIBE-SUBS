1
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,791
[KYON]
Something's wrong.

2
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,083
That's what it felt like anyway.

3
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,083
The game on TV was between
schools from another town.

4
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,750
I had nothing to do
with either school,

5
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,958
but because I tend to
sympothize with underdogs,

6
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,833
I found myself routing
for the losing team.

7
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,291
And it was right about then
that I suddenly got the feeling

8
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,916
Haruhi was gonna call.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,750
[phone ringing]

10
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,416
[KYON]
What does she want?

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,375
Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

12
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,500
I know, I know.

13
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,083
[HARUHI]
Hey, you're free, right?

14
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,166
Good, meet us at 2:00 in front
of the station. Don't be late!

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,166
[dial tone]

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,458
[KYON] I didn't even have
the chance to say anything.

17
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,083
[phone ringing]

18
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,583
[KYON]
What?

19
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:10,541
[HARUHI] I forgot to tell you
to bring your swim trunks.

20
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:11,916
And some money, too.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,166
Oh, wait, and your bike.
Definitely bring your bike.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,916
That's it! Over and out!

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,041
[phone clicks]

24
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,500
[KYON]
Uh. No.

25
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,208
[KYON]
That was weird.

26
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,833
It's like I knew what
Haruhi was gonna say

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,541
before she said it.

28
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,458
Yeah, no. Actually,
it felt like we'd had

29
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,000
the exact same
conversation before.

30
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,166
Like déjà vu or something.

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,666
[COMMENTATOR] There's
the wind-up. It's outta there!

32
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,916
Home run! What a shot!

33
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,625
[KYON]
Summer's almost over, isn't it?

34
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,625
[HARUHI]
You're late, Kyon!

35
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,875
Where's your motivation, huh?

36
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,041
[KYON] Yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

37
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,750
Oh, I just got here too.

38
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,750
[HARUHI] Now that we're all
present and accounted for,

39
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,791
we can go!

40
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,958
Where?

41
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,666
To the public pool!
Where do you think?

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,541
[KYON] Figures,
considering what I brought.

43
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,875
[HARUHI] We've got lots and lots
of summer vacationy things to do

44
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,166
during our break, but
there's only so much time,

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,375
and once it's gone,
it's gone for good.

46
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,666
So we're gonne do everything
we can while we can

47
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,375
during our one and only
summer as tenth graders.

48
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,291
And for starters, we're gonna
ride bikes over to the pool.

49
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,416
So, did everyone ride
their bikes today?

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,208
No. The only bikes
we have to take

51
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,833
are the ones you and I brought.

52
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,875
[KYON]
Huh?

53
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,375
All right, Kyon. Don't let
Koizumi beat you over there.

54
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,375
Come on, full speed ahead!

55
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,416
[KYON]
Boost!

56
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,375
Come on, guys. Hurry up
and park your bikes already.

57
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,541
We're trying to have fun, Kyon.
Stop acting like you're tired.

58
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,416
[KYON]
And whose fault is that?

59
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,541
[HARUHI]
Ah. Can you smell the chlorine?

60
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,625
That really makes
it feel like summer.

61
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,083
[HARUHI giggles]

62
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,666
Hurry up and get in!
Water's all warm. It's perfect!

63
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,541
[KYON] Can't she see
the no diving signs?

64
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,166
They're everywhere.

65
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,500
Doesn't that look like fun?

66
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:42,041
In a way, it makes me smile.
Such a peaceful scene, isn't it?

67
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,916
I mean, seeing Miss
Suzumiya enjoy the day

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,833
in a normal fashion, rather
charming, don't you think?

69
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,291
She called me, told me
what to bring,

70
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,375
and ordered me to meet her 

71
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,958
without telling me
what was going on.

72
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,416
There's nothing charming
or normal about it.

73
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,416
Well, if you ask me,
none of what you mentioned

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,791
is anything to make
such a fuss over.

75
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,333
As long as Miss Suzumiya's
having a good time,

76
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,208
we don't have to worry about
any earth-shattering events.

77
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,125
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

78
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,458
[KYON]
I hope you're right.

79
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,958
[KOIZUMU]
Hm?

80
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,875
Something wrong?

81
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,875
No. It's just my imagination.

82
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,041
With everything that's
happened since we met,

83
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,458
you could say I've
become slightly paranoid.

84
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,500
[KYON]
Hm?

85
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,083
[ALL giggling]

86
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:33,333
[KYON]
Hot.... Hot. So hot.

87
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:39,125
Jeez. Now I know why they call
it a "public" swimming pool.

88
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,333
Seems like everyone
in town's here today.

89
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,583
[KYON] I wonder why
Haruhi chose this place.

90
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,750
[KYON]
Hm?

91
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,208
[KYON]
There's that feeling again.

92
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,916
It's like I've seen this
happen once before.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,791
With Nagato looking kinda
bored like that. Alone.

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,166
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

95
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,208
[KYON]
Uh.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,250
[KYON]
Uh-huh.

97
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,291
And then Haruhi's supposed
to say something like...

98
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,375
These two guys are
my brigade members.

99
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,833
And they do what I say.

100
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,666
So if you want somethin',
you can ask them.

101
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,375
It's time to have some fun!

102
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,625
Let's all go play water soccer!

103
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,166
[KYON]
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,791
[KYON] Oh well.
Sometimes déjà vu's happen.

105
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,625
[HARUHI]
Here is comes, Mikuru!

106
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,916
[MIKURU]
Okay!

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,958
[MIKURU yelps]

108
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,291
[HARUHI] I have a couple ideas
about the rest of our vacation.

109
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,208
Check it out!

110
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,458
[KYON]
Two weeks to do all of that?

111
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,791
Is there anything you
want to do, Mikuru?

112
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,750
[MIKURU] Umm... I'd like
to try goldfish scooping.

113
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,208
[HARUHI]
Okay. Goldfish scooping it is.

114
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,458
Could I see that?

115
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,000
Thank you.

116
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,625
We'll the list tomorrow.

117
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,666
Does anyone know if there's a
bon festival happening close by?

118
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,125
Or a firework show?

119
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,375
I can check and see
if there's anything.

120
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,416
[HARUHI] Don't foget
about goldfish scooping.

121
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,541
It's Mikuru's only request.

122
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,958
[KOIZUMU]
I'll get right on it.

123
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,625
[KYON] I always get
stuck with the bill.

124
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,583
[HARUHI]
Well, that's it. See ya!

125
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,666
[KOIZUMU]
I'm off, too.

126
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,916
[MIKURU]
Bye, bye.

127
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,250
[KYON]
Nagato!

128
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,541
Uhh, it's... 

129
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,083
I guess it's nothing important.
Anyway, how've you been?

130
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,833
Is everything okay?

131
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,041
I am fine.

132
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,708
Well, that's good to hear.

133
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,458
Yes.

134
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,500
[grunts]

135
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,500
[KYON] What the heck?
Why did I wanna talk to her?

136
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,458
[phone ringing]

137
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,916
[KYON] The next morning, I was
waken from my peaceful slumber

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,583
by a call from Haruhi.

139
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,375
She said they'd
found a bon festival.

140
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,041
It was happening tonight.
At a park somewhere.

141
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,375
We're all gonna go buy yukatas!

142
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,458
[KYON] So, we went
to a clothing outlet.

143
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,583
Haruhi picked out yukatas
for Miss Asahina and Nagato.

144
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,166
Then marched them straight
into the changing room.

145
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,125
After making us wait
about an hour or so,

146
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,333
they all three finally came out.

147
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,333
[KYON]
Whoa.

148
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,708
[KOIZUMI]
You look wondering in those.

149
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,333
Of course we do!
I picked them out myself.

150
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,041
Especially Mikuru's.

151
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,875
Look at you, you're so cute.
I must be a genius.

152
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,458
Uh... Uh, yes.

153
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,666
[KYON]
The blushing makes her cuter!

154
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,791
Wow.

155
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,583
[KYON]
A bon festival, huh?

156
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,916
It figures that
it'd be so crowded.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,958
Hm?

158
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,416
I haven't been to a
bon festival in a while,

159
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,041
but it feels like I
just went to one.

160
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,458
That tower.

161
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,750
Those vendors.

162
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,166
[HARUHI]
Look, Mikuru!

163
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,625
They've got goldfish scooping
just like you wanted!

164
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,500
You're gonna catch a ton!

165
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,291
Do you wanna go scoop some fish?

166
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,625
We could have a contest.

167
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,833
I think I'll pass.

168
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,291
How 'bout you, Nagato?
Wanna get some food?

169
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,708
[KYON]
Hm?

170
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,500
Don't tell me you're actually
into this kinda stuff.

171
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,375
I got it.

172
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,416
[NAGATO]
No.

173
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,208
[NAGATO]
That.

174
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,875
[VENDOR]
It's yours for 800 yen!

175
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,541
[KYON] I wish she would've
let me buy tht for her.

176
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,416
It's the least I could do
after all she's done for us.

177
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,250
Wow! What an unbelievable haul!

178
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,541
But I only kept one, 'cause
I don't have any place

179
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,416
to keep 'em. And I
gave one to Mikuru.

180
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,083
Go ahead and have one,
but only one.

181
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,458
Okay, thanks.

182
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,250
[HARUHI] Uh. Hey, Yuki.
What's up with the mask?

183
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,666
[NAGATO]
I bought it.

184
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,750
[HARUHI]
Oh, okay.

185
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,666
[HARUHI] Fireworks!
That's what we're gonna do next!

186
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,875
We'll go set up some fireworks!

187
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,041
[KYON]
Do you even understand

188
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,291
the meaning of the
word moderation?

189
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,416
[KYON] It was summer,
and summer vacation.

190
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,833
And I guess that's why I
wanted to forget about it.

191
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,291
But the truth was, I couldn't
ignore it any longer.

192
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,166
[HARUHI] Tomorrow,
we're gonna catch some bugs.

193
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,791
Haruhi, I don't want
to spoil your fun,

194
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,416
but have you finished
your homework?

195
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,541
[HARUHI] Are you kidding?
That stuff's totally easy.

196
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,541
You can finish it
in like three days.

197
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,250
Three days?!

198
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,041
[HARUHI] You have to get
rid of that junk first

199
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,041
so you can spend the rest
of your summer having fun

200
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,083
and not worrying about it.
That's the only way

201
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,291
to really get the most
out of your vacation.

202
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,541
[KYON] Why does she
have to be so smart?

203
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,583
[KYON] The folks upstairs
weren't terribly fair

204
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,250
when they were divvying
up the stats for us.

205
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,500
[HARUHI] Listen up! We're gonna
go bug catching tomorrow!

206
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,708
And whoever catches
the most bugs is gonna

207
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,416
get to be brigade
leader for a whole day!

208
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,833
[KYON]
No thanks.

209
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,416
That sounds like fun.
But, can we catch just any bugs?

210
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,041
[HARUHI]
Hm... No. Only cicadas!

211
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,458
That's it!

212
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:44,625
I'm calling it the SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest!

213
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,541
[KYON] The next day was
beautiful, sunny and bright.

214
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,458
And although everyone caught
bugs the best way they knew how,

215
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,833
the winner of the contest ended
up being, you guessed it,

216
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,041
Haruhi.

217
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,625
[HARUHI] It's important
to follow the spirit

218
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,375
of catch and release
with these guys.

219
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,125
You never know.
If we let 'em go now,

220
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,083
they might return
the favor sometime.

221
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,291
[KYON] Now, what could a
cicada possibly do for me?

222
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,083
[HARUHI]
Hurry! Go back to the mountains!

223
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:14,125
[cicadas chriping]

224
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,291
[KYON]
For some reason,

225
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,166
I kinda feel like
Pandora opening her box.

226
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,666
[MIKURU]
W-Welcome to our store!

227
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,875
[KYON]
We met the next day,

228
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,916
eventhough we had no
idea what was going on.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,125
Our cluelessness continued as we
were made to wear frog costumes

230
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,000
and hand balloons out in front
of the local supermarket.

231
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,208
Welcome to our part-time job.

232
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,458
[sighing]

233
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,166
[HARUHI]
Good work, you guys!

234
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,833
[KYON] What's with
the special treatment?

235
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,208
You're the best.

236
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,458
The manager's super grateful
for all the hard work.

237
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,250
Who cares how grateful
he is. What about our pay?

238
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,041
That's it.

239
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,083
[KYON]
Huh?

240
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,291
I've had my eye
on this for a while.

241
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,375
The manager gave it to us 

242
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,250
'cause Mikuru
looked so cute in it.

243
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,291
[KYON] We were working, sweat
pouring down our foreheads,

244
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,541
for that?!

245
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,625
We'll keep 'em in the
club room as a souvenir.

246
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,875
Mikuru, you have my permission
to wear 'em whenever you want.

247
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,958
Isn't he the greatest?

248
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,916
[gasps]

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,958
Uh.

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,375
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

251
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,625
[KYON] Later that night,
my peaceful slumber

252
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,875
was interrupted by a phone call.

253
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,833
[phone ringing]

254
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,875
Damn it.

255
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,125
[MIKURU groaning]

256
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,250
[KYON gasps]

257
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,500
[MIKURU]
Kyon...

258
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,125
Miss Asahina?

259
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,125
[MIKURU]
Yes, it's me.

260
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:37,458
Something really bad...
I don't know...

261
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,208
[MIKURU crying]

262
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,166
Wha--?

263
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,583
[KOIZUMU]
Hello. It's Koizumi.

264
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,250
[growls]

265
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,041
Why are you with Miss Asahina
in the middle of the night?

266
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,000
[KOIZUMU]
We have a situtation here.

267
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you think you could
come meet us right now?

268
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,250
[KYON]
Absolutely. Where?

269
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,500
[KYON]
Miss Asahina! What happened?

270
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,250
Oh... Oh, Kyon. I can't...

271
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,458
[crying]

272
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,541
I can't go back to the future.

273
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:17,583
[MIKURU sobbing]

274
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,125
I'll explain it the best I can.

275
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:28,083
Currently, we're stuck in a time
loop that seems to be infinite.

276
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,375
[KYON] It's hard to
believe you're serious

277
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,791
with that smile on your face.

278
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,000
Come on, Koizumi, do you
realize what you just said?

279
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,416
[KOIZUMU] Of course I do.
More than I want to, believe me.

280
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,875
Ealier, I was having a
word with Miss Asahina.

281
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,166
[KYON] Next time, call me
when you have a word with her!

282
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,041
And that was when
we both realized that

283
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,375
something seemed off about
our current flow of time.

284
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,791
Actually, Miss Asahina
discovered it.

285
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,500
Thanks to her, my suspicions
were confirmed.

286
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,666
What kind of suspicions?

287
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,250
[KOIZUMU] That we'd been
reliving the same period of time

288
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,916
over and over again.

289
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,583
[KYON]
You already said that.

290
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,791
[KOIZUMU] We've been
repeating the days

291
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,208
between August
17th through the 31st.

292
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,958
It's a never-ending,
endless summer.

293
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,416
The future doesn't exist
in this world anymore.

294
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,833
Time stops at September 1st.

295
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,333
That's the reason Miss Asahina
can't travel back to the future.

296
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,791
It's only natural.

297
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,875
There's nothing natural
about not having a future.

298
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,541
Who's gonna believe
such a thing?

299
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,458
Well, for starters, we were sort
of hoping you would believe it.

300
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,000
[MIKURU crying]
Um...

301
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,125
I can try to help explain it.

302
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,375
Here goes.

303
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,666
Because I have to
classified information,

304
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,375
I used classified information
to get in touch with the future.

305
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,958
The thing is,

306
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,750
I haven't gotten any classified
information for about a week.

307
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,625
And I started to think
how weird that was.

308
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,041
I was so surprised.

309
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,291
I classified information,
I really did,

310
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,750
but it was classified
information, too.

311
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,416
I don't know what to do.

312
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,875
[MIKURU crying]

313
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,250
[KYON] I don't know how to
help you, but I'm wondering,

314
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,333
are all the classfied
things you're talking about

315
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,166
stuff you can't say on TV?

316
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,750
What about those closed spaces
you were talking about before?

317
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,750
Maybe we're trapped
in one of those.

318
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,375
[KOIZUMU]
Mh-hm.

319
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,791
It's not one of those.

320
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,125
A specific section of
time has been torn away.

321
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,791
At exactly midnight on August
the 31st, everything resets,

322
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,291
and then time
reverts straight back

323
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,250
to the morning
of August the 17th.

324
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,750
That's the process.

325
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,041
What about our...?

326
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,083
Wait, what about the
whole world's memories?

327
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,833
Their memory is reset.

328
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,291
Everyone's memory starts
over from the beginning.

329
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,750
[KYON] Another problem
involving time. Perfect.

330
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,083
I guess that figures when
there's a time traveller around.

331
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,416
[KOIZUMU]
No.

332
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,208
Miss Asahina didn't have
anything to do with this.

333
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,625
[KYON]
Then what's causing it?

334
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,875
[KOIZUMU]
Miss Suzumiya.

335
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,625
[sighs]

336
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,041
Somewhere inside her, 

337
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,750
there's a desire to have
summer vacation last forever.

338
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,041
I'm sure she
doesn't even realize it.

339
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,208
Oh, come on.

340
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,208
You mean she still
hasn't had enough fun?

341
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,791
That's what it looks like.

342
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,541
Perhaps she feels like
there's something else

343
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,416
that needs to happen before
our summer vacation is over.

344
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,583
[KYON] Man, the trouble
she gets us into

345
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,916
is always galactic in scale.

346
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,750
[KYON] All right,
what do you want me to do?

347
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,791
If I knew that, we'd have
this problem solved by now.

348
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,000
[KYON]
You're too close.

349
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,208
You seem like
you're enjoying this.

350
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,583
You wanna tell me why?

351
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,208
Please don't take
it the wrong way,

352
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,333
but this explains the
feelings of déjà vu I've had,

353
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,541
and the ones you've
been feeling as well.

354
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,875
Now that I think about it,

355
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,875
they were most likely the
residue of our memories

356
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,583
from every instance where
time had been reset.

357
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,875
[KYON]
Are we the only ones?

358
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,000
Or can other people
feel this, too?

359
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,333
[KOIZUMU]
I doubt that.

360
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,916
You and I are acceptions
to the rule, though.

361
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,125
The only people who can
sense this strangeness,

362
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,333
are the ones closest
to Miss Suzumiya.

363
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,625
[KYON]
What about Haruhi?

364
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,791
Does she even know
this stuff is happening?

365
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,875
[KOIZUMU]
No, I don't think so.

366
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,833
Besides, it would be very
bad for us if she did.

367
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,041
However, there is someone

368
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,583
who is unaffected by
the feelins of déjà vu.

369
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,958
As a matter of fact,

370
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,291
this person remembers
everything that's happened.

371
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,583
Oh, yeah? Who would
that person be?

372
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,250
[KOIZUMU]
You already know.

373
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,416
It's Miss Nagato.

374
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,125
The data integration thought
entity transcendes space

375
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,583
and time. So does she.

376
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,958
Is that true?

377
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,708
[NAGATO]
Yes.

378
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,833
Then, you remember everything?

379
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes.

380
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,208
Really?

381
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,666
So, how many times has
this happened to us?

382
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,458
[NAGATO]
This would be 15,498 times?

383
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,875
[gasps]

384
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,750
[KYON] Fifteen thousand,
four-hundred and ninety-eight?

385
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:40,250
What do you mean 15,498?
What are you saying, Nagato?

386
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,375
And, you're being
completely serious?

387
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,791
Yes.

388
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,666
[KYON] So, you're saying
we've done the exact same things

389
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,583
every time that many times?

390
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,166
[NAGATO]
Not necessarily.

391
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,833
Throughout 15,498 repitions,

392
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:57,083
we did not attend a bon
festival the 2,391st time

393
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,541
and the 11,054th time.

394
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,708
We went to the
festival but did not go

395
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,916
to a fish scooping
booth 437 times.

396
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,125
We obtained part-time
jobs 9,025 times

397
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,583
--and there were six different--
--[KYON] Okay. I got it.

398
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,166
[KYON] Fifteen-thousand,
four-hundred ninety-eight.

399
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:25,250
That's what she said. Times two
weeks. That's... 594 years.

400
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,958
She's the only one who remembers

401
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,208
everything we do
all those times.

402
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,541
And she's had to repeat
them over and over again.

403
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,125
Nagato...

404
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,375
I can't even begin to image
what it's been like for you.

405
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,541
That's gotta be the
craziest story ever.

406
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,250
[KYON] The next night,
we went stargazing.

407
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,041
We were on the balcony
of Nagato's apartment,

408
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,958
since her place
had the best view.

409
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,541
Koizumi brought the telescope.

410
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,750
[HARUHI]
I wonder if they're real.

411
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,666
What's real?

412
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,666
[HARUHI]
Martians.

413
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,958
[KYON]
I kinda hope they aren't.

414
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,125
[HARUHI] I can't see
anyone on the surface.

415
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,291
You know, I bet there is a
reserved race of beings

416
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,958
living underground.
They're probably friendly, too.

417
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,416
[KYON]
Yeah. Dream on.

418
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,875
[HARUHI] Whenever us
humans finally land on Mars,

419
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,291
I'm sure the Martians will pop
out from wherever they're hiding

420
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,833
and say, "Welcome
to Mars," or something.

421
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,166
[KYON] It'll get
mistaken for an attack.

422
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,208
[HARUHI] Oh. I'm bored.
I'm gonna look for UFOs now.

423
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,666
I wish I knew what
else she wanted to do.

424
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,333
Yes, what indeed.

425
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:36,166
If we knew that, we'd be on
our way to solving this problem.

426
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,541
Here's something.
Why don't we try this?

427
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,375
What if someone were to grab
Miss Suzumiya from behind

428
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,125
and then they whisper,
"I love you" right into her ear.

429
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,958
And who's going
to be doing this?

430
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,500
Who else could play
that role other than you?

431
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,083
[KYON growls]

432
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,125
I'm vetoing that idea!

433
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,083
[KOIZUMU] All right.
Shall I give it a try?

434
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,708
No, I'm just kidding.
That isn't a role I can play.

435
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,583
Besides, it would just
confuse Miss Suzumiya.

436
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,750
[KYON]
The next day,

437
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,750
we swung for the fences
at the batting cages.

438
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,791
[HARUHI grunts]

439
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,250
[KYON]
Hey, Nagato.

440
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,958
You knew about this
time loop we're in

441
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,250
way before Miss Asahina
figured it out, didn't you?

442
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,291
Yes.

443
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,041
So, how come you didn't
say anything about it?

444
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,583
[NAGATO]
My function is to observe.

445
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,625
[HARUHI grunts]

446
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,500
[KYON sighs]

447
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,208
[KYON]
Right.

448
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,416
[KYON]
We kept chugging along,

449
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,000
doing all kinds of
summer vacation things.

450
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,833
We just kept going and
going and doing stuff.

451
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,500
And the whole time,
all I could think was

452
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,166
that none of it was going
to be enough for Haruhi.

453
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,916
But what could I do
about it? Nothing.

454
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,291
So, we ended up like we
always did at August the 30th.

455
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,958
[HARUHI] That's it, we've done
everything on our list.

456
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,125
[sighs]

457
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:20,125
But now I'm wondering
if we did enough... if....

458
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,875
No, I guess we did.

459
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,541
Hey, is there anything
else you want to do?

460
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,291
Oh, okay.

461
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,791
I guess we did everything we
wanted to do over the summer,

462
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,583
so that's enough.

463
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,208
[KYON] No, it's not.
Not by a long shot.

464
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,500
You're still not satisfied.

465
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,875
Okay, we're done for today.

466
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,833
I set tomorrow
aside just in case,

467
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,416
but you can take
the day off, I guess.

468
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,708
I'll see you guys at the
club room on Monday.

469
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,666
[KYON gasping]

470
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,916
[KYON]
No, wait! Haruhi!

471
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,083
[KYON gasps]
There's that feeling again.

472
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,791
It's strong... Stronger
than all the others.

473
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,208
I can't let Haruhi leave.

474
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,166
If I let her walk out that door,

475
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,625
we'll end up reliving the past
two weeks again and again

476
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,583
for a thousand more times.

477
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:09,333
But... what should I do?

478
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,541
What should I say?

479
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,583
There must've been a clue
in something Haruhi said.

480
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,541
But what was it?

481
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,958
What's she been
saying all this time?

482
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:24,041
[KYON]
I don't know. I can't remember.

483
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,125
[KYON]
It's August 31st.

484
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,375
And I still haven't
touched my homework yet.

485
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,833
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

486
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,166
[KYON] There's no point
doing it. I mean,

487
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,708
we're just gonna keep reliving
the last couple of weeks.

488
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:53,250
Whatever happens next,
whether tomorrow comes or not,

489
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,625
a different version of me
will have to deal with it.
