1
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,625
[GIRL A] Next up is the
inter-club relay race.

2
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:33,916
[START]
On your mark...

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,166
Get set...

4
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,750
[cheering]

5
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:44,625
[MIKURU whimpering]

6
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,875
[KYON]
Here I go!

7
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,083
Here.

8
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,375
[gasps]

9
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:54,583
[gunshots]

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,500
[HARUHI]
Darn it.

11
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,000
I wanted to come from last place
and pass everyone at the end!

12
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,958
But thanks to Yuki,
we blew 'em away,

13
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,916
and left 'em
chokin' on our dust!

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It was a fantastic
effort though.

15
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,250
I just hope the track team
doesn't lost their confidence

16
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,583
because of our excellence.

17
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,958
Come on, guys,
this isn't funny at all.

18
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,875
Everybody's gonna
think we're weirder now,

19
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,583
than they ever did before.

20
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,875
[KYON] Although, it's a little
late to be worrying about that.

21
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,791
[KYON] And yes, the outfits and
the headbands with odd phrases

22
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:27,333
were all Haruhi's idea, but I
bet you knew that already.

23
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,750
Why are we doing this again?

24
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,416
Okay, that's it.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,666
Can I change out
of this thing now?

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,291
You and Miss Suzumiya's
band of freaks

27
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,291
are still the weirdest
cats in school.

28
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,083
It's epic stuff, my brother.
Keep up the good work, you hear?

29
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,208
Cut it out.

30
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,500
I'm doing everything I can to be

31
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,666
as low-profile around
here as possible.

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,958
Running in that outfit was
definitely low-profile, sir.

33
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, it wasn't easy,
let me tell you.

34
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,416
Yeah, I think you're
sorta missing the point.

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,166
I bet they're gonna
stick a picture of you

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,791
wearing that in the yearbook.
Can't wait to see that.

37
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,666
Gimme a break already.

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,916
[TANIGUCHI whistles]

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,500
Huh?

40
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,208
Who's that?

41
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,000
Ew!

42
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,416
Gross.

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,166
[TANIGUCHI] Did you see
the one with the ponytail?

44
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,375
She's such a cutie pie!

45
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:15,583
[KYON] Our neverending, endless
summer vacation had ended.

46
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,416
And here we were, second term,
and having an athletic festival.

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,458
Of course, Haruhi wasn't
gonna sit still

48
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,208
on a beautiful day like today.

49
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,666
Just look at the poor
souls left in her wake.

50
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,250
[KYON]
Yeah... That's Haruhi.

51
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,208
She sure loves her
festivals, doesn't she?

52
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,000
[KYON] Our bizarre day of
athletic festivities was over.

53
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,750
It was the beginning
of a new month,

54
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,083
and our school arts festival
was right around the corner.

55
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,958
And, as you can see, everyone
was busy getting ready for it.

56
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,333
[KYON] By the way,
if you were wondering

57
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,500
what me and Haruhi's
class were doing,

58
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,916
check out the board.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,666
Yep, we wussed out, and
decided that our class project

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,666
was gonna be some
kind of survey.

61
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,166
Ever since Ryoko Asakura "left"
back in the spring term,

62
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,500
there wasn't anyone crazy enough

63
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,833
to take over the leadership
duties of our class.

64
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,375
We're going, Kyon.

65
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,416
[KYON sighs]

66
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:45,208
[KYON] So, with a level of
disinterest bordering on apathy,

67
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:49,125
I find myself once again
trudging over to the club room.

68
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,500
Why? Well, I'll tell you why.

69
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,875
It's all because the girl who's
marching along beside me

70
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,875
said the following:

71
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,583
I can't believe our project
is gonna be a survey.

72
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,291
That's gotta be the dumbest
idea I've ever heard!

73
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,166
Why did they have to go and
pick the least fun thing to do?

74
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,041
Well, maybe you should've
said something about it

75
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,583
when you had the chance.

76
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,958
Didn't you see the class?

77
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,291
And that look on
Mr. Okabe's face?

78
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,500
It was like someone had died.

79
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,625
Oh, whatever.

80
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,875
It wasn't like I was
gonna participate

81
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,250
in anything the class
was doing anyway.

82
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,708
[KYON]
Hmm.

83
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,166
Although, I think I remember
you having something to do

84
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,916
with our class winning the
track and field championships.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,125
And, if I'm not mistaken,
weren't you the one

86
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,333
who entered every event
and won all of them?

87
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,000
That was you, wasn't it?
Or was that someone else?

88
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,166
[HARUHI] This and that
are two different things.

89
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,583
I'm talking about the
school arts festival.

90
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,750
It's like the most important,
super event we get a year!

91
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,125
Oh, it is, is it?

92
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,458
Absolutely!

93
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,125
And this year, we're gonna
do something so cool,

94
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,166
it's gonna blow everyone's mind!

95
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,666
[KYON] The look on Haruhi's
face when she said that,

96
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,041
full of confidence
and shining brightly,

97
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,666
it must've been what
Hannibal looked like

98
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,916
as he crossed the Alps
during the Second Punic War!

99
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,750
It's the school arts festival!

100
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,875
So get with the program,
and act more excited about it!

101
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,083
[KYON chuckles]

102
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,166
[HARUHI] This is the
only chance we'll get

103
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,458
to experience this
as tenth graders!

104
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,541
I know, I got it.
But I just don't see

105
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,375
the point in getting
all riled up about it.

106
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,375
But if you don't get
all riled up about it,

107
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,125
then there's no
point in doing it!

108
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,583
All the school festivals I've
ever been to were like that.

109
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,166
[KYON]
Did you guys go all out

110
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,000
at your old junior
high or something?

111
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,125
[HARUHI]
Not even.

112
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,125
They were all pretty lame.

113
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,500
That's why I want all my high
school festivals to be exciting!

114
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,708
[KYON] Then, what'll it take to
make this one exciting for you?

115
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,583
[KYON] And please, explain it
so I can understand.

116
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,458
Oh, all right.

117
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,125
I'll tell you about it when
we get to the club room.

118
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,125
[KYON gasps]
The scent of lavender!

119
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,291
Oh! Hello, there!

120
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,833
[KYON]
I thought flowers were blooming.

121
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,625
I'll go prepare some tea, okay?

122
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,875
[KYON]
Oh, don't trouble yourself.

123
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,333
Stop it, you look
like a dirty old man!

124
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,583
Hey, Mikuru, where's Koizumi?

125
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,083
[MIKURU]
He hasn't come by yet.

126
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,791
I think he's running late.

127
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,708
[water pouring]

128
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,875
[HARUHI] Mikuru,
what's holding up the tea?

129
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,750
[MIKURU]
I-I'm bringing it now!

130
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,458
Mikuru.

131
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,000
[MIKURU]
Yes?

132
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,500
Don't you remember all that
stuff we talked about before?

133
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,500
[MIKURU]
Huh? What do you mean?

134
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,250
I mean, whenever you serve tea,

135
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,666
you have to try to make
sure you trip and stumble

136
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,625
at least a third of the time!

137
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,416
You know, you're not acting
like a klutsy maid at all.

138
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,833
[MIKURU]
Huh? Oh. S-Sorry!

139
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,333
[KYON]
What's up with her?

140
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,541
Does she think all maids have
to be clumsy or something?

141
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,500
Don't worry.
Today's your lucky day.

142
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,583
You get to go and
practice on Kyon!

143
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,708
Your goal is to get the cup to
land upside-down on his head!

144
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:49,791
Really?

145
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,666
Miss Asahina,
Haruhi's the only person

146
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,541
who's gonna think a
joke like that is funny.

147
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,916
--You should know that by now.
--[MIKURU whimpers]

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,333
[HARUHI]
Hey, dummy.

149
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,833
I never joke about
stuff like that.

150
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,833
I am always super serious!

151
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,000
[KYON] If that's the case,
then we're in big trouble!

152
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,125
All right, Mikuru,

153
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,750
I'll demonstrate the
proper technique,

154
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,541
and then it's your turn.

155
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,416
But I-- Huh?

156
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,500
[KYON gasps]

157
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey!

158
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,250
Hold it!

159
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,708
Hey, you! Stop interfering!

160
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,916
Are you crazy?

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,416
I'm not gonna just sit
here and do nothing

162
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,875
while you pour boiling
water on my head!

163
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,333
[HARUHI]
Hmph!

164
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,291
[MIKURU chuckles]

165
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,791
[MIKURU]
Here you are.

166
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,416
[KYON]
Oh, Nagato.

167
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,875
If she made Taniguchi a cup,
he'd cherish it for three days!

168
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,250
[door opens]

169
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm sorry, everyone.

170
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,833
Homeroom ran a
little late today.

171
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,583
I hope our meeting
wasn't delayed too long

172
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,666
because of my tardiness.

173
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,041
Wait, what meeting?

174
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,166
What's he talking about?

175
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,791
[KYON]
Yeah, I forgot to tell you,

176
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,541
but I let everyone else
know about it at lunch today.

177
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,791
I guess I just figured
I'd tell you whenever.

178
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,500
How come you have
the time to go to

179
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,000
their classrooms
and tell them?!

180
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,791
I sit right in front
of you all day long.

181
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,500
Telling me couldn't
be any easier!

182
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,166
Yeah, like it even matters.

183
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,500
The problem isn't so much
when you found out about it,

184
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,458
it's what you're
going to do about it!

185
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,875
[KYON] Was that
supposed to be profound?

186
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,125
The SOS Brigade's
gotta start thinking now

187
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,708
about what we're gonna do next!

188
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,083
[KYON] Are we talking
about now-now or later?

189
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,083
And by "we," did you
mean we as in us?

190
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,583
Or "we" as in you?

191
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,541
Everyone here is
gonna participate.

192
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,041
This is an SOS Brigade
event, after all.

193
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,666
And by that, you mean...

194
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,333
We were just talking about it!

195
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,875
The school arts festival, what
else is going on around here?!

196
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,583
Right, well that's something
the whole school's involved in.

197
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,916
And if you're so
hot and bothered

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,375
about being the main attraction,

199
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,041
you should've signed up
to be on the festival staff.

200
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,500
[KYON] They probably could
use all the help they can get.

201
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,208
[HARUHI]
That's a total waste of time!

202
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,333
We have to do something that's
up to SOS Brigade standards.

203
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,166
I worked hard to
build this brigade

204
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,208
into the coolest thing
the school's ever seen.

205
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,541
Everyone knows about us!

206
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,250
We've got a
reputation to uphold!

207
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,083
[KYON] It's easy for
you 'cause all you do

208
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,541
is come up with crazy schemes.

209
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,250
Miss Asahina and I have
to suffer through them

210
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,208
Koizumi just sits there,
smiling like a weirdo.

211
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,333
And Nagato never helps
with the brainstorming.

212
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,083
I'm the normal one here.

213
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,083
She should consider
that for a change.

214
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,166
[HARUHI]
We have to do something

215
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,166
that lives up to
their expectations.

216
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,916
[KYON] Now what exactly
does anyone expect

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,416
from the SOS Brigade?

218
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,125
I know, let's take a
survey and find out!

219
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,375
Hey, Mikuru, what's
your class gonna do?

220
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,833
[MIKURU]
My class?

221
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:41,875
Um...

222
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,541
A yakisoba cafe.

223
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,166
I bet that means you're
gonna be a waitress, huh?

224
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,250
How did you know about that?

225
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,541
Everyone in my class
said I'd be perfect for it.

226
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,750
[HARUHI]
Hmm...

227
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,791
[chuckles]

228
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,083
[HARUHI]
What about you, Koizumi?

229
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,916
Well, my class decided
it would be fun

230
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,375
if we put on a play.

231
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,041
But we're debating
whether to do a classic

232
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,750
or something original.

233
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,208
[KYON] Now they sound like
a lively bunch of people.

234
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,416
[KYON]
And pretty annoying.

235
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,000
[HARUHI]
Ohh...

236
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:12,916
And Yuki?

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,958
Fortune-telling.

238
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,208
Really?

239
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,250
Yes.

240
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,625
[KYON] Nagato telling fortunes?
Or telling futures?

241
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,791
Oh! I got a great idea!

242
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:24,791
How 'bout this?

243
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,958
Let's mix everything
together and

244
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,208
do a survey-cafe-
fortune-telling-theater!

245
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,708
Stop being a dork and let's get
this meeting started already!

246
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,750
[KYON growls]

247
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,708
Not sure what you
want us to look at.

248
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,291
There's nothing
written on it yet.

249
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,291
Just hold your horses.

250
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,583
Hey, Mikuru. Since you're
the secretary,

251
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,583
make sure you write
everything down.

252
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,458
[MIKURU]
Uh... Okay.

253
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,375
[KYON] I didn't know Miss
Asahina was our secretary.

254
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,708
I doubt anyone knows

255
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,916
'cause it's something
Haruhi just came up with.

256
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,208
We, the SOS Brigade,
are gonna show a movie

257
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,250
at this year's festival!

258
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,000
[KYON]
Huh?

259
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,333
[KYON] I have absolutely
no idea what goes on

260
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,416
inside that head of hers.
And I don't wanna know.

261
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,250
This is typical Haruhi.

262
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,541
However...

263
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,333
How in the heck
is this a meeting?

264
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,250
It's like you're on a soapbox
giving a political speech.

265
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,791
This is normal for us.

266
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,083
[KYON]
Ugh! Too close!

267
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,041
It looks like Miss
Suzumiya decided on

268
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,000
what we were gonna do
right from the beginning,

269
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,500
and negotiations are
out of the question.

270
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,000
But I wonder why she
decided on a movie.

271
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,041
Maybe she saw a really
bad flick on TV last night.

272
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,750
And if the movie was
especially horrible,

273
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,041
it could have put her in a
lousy mood or something.

274
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,333
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

275
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,541
[HARUHI]
You know,

276
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,208
there's something I
always wondered about.

277
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,375
[BOTH]
Huh?

278
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,625
[KYON] I wonder what's
inside your head.

279
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,000
How come on TV shows,

280
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,750
when they get to the last
episode, someone dies?

281
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,583
That always feels
really fake to me.

282
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,791
I mean, their deaths
are so convenient.

283
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,333
It's weird.

284
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,958
I guess that's why I can't stand
shows or movies or anything

285
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,041
where a character
dies at the end.

286
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:22,166
I would never make a
movie that ended like that.

287
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,291
[HARUHI]
Mm-hmm.

288
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,333
That's what I mean!
Now do you get it?

289
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,125
What do you mean,
"That's what I mean"?

290
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,333
All you said was that we're
gonna be showing a movie.

291
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,041
But where's this
movie coming from?

292
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,708
Oh, Kyon, you're not
very smart, are you?

293
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,916
We are gonna make our own movie.

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,875
And then, we're gonna show
it at the school arts festival!

295
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,416
And the credits are gonna read:
"Presented by the SOS Brigade."

296
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,875
When exactly did we
become the Movie Club?

297
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,041
What are you talking about?
We're still the SOS Brigade.

298
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,583
Nobody said we turned
into the Movie Club.

299
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,333
[KOIZUMI] I think I
understand what's going on.

300
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,583
[GROUP]
Huh?

301
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,291
She's saying we're going
to shoot our own movie,

302
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,541
and then screen it
during the arts festival.

303
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,291
That's the plan, isn't it?

304
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,625
That is the plan!

305
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,166
But um... why did you
decide to shoot a movie?

306
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,708
If you really wanna know,

307
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,458
I was having trouble
falling asleep last night.

308
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,083
I turned on the TV and
this crappy movie was on.

309
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,625
[KYON]
I knew it!

310
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,041
It had to be the worst movie
I've ever seen in my whole life!

311
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,666
It was so bad, for a sec there,

312
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,708
I was thinking about
crank-calling the director!

313
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,291
--[MIKURU yelps]
--And that's when it hit me!

314
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,625
If that's the best they can do,

315
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,750
I can definitely
make a better movie!

316
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,000
Uh-huh...

317
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,166
So I figured, what the
heck, let's go for it!

318
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,333
[whimpers]

319
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,166
If you wanna be a
director or a producer,

320
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,416
that's fine with me.

321
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,083
Good for you, godspeed,
and so on and so forth.

322
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,750
But, some of us might
have other things

323
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,166
we'd like to do, you know?

324
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,708
What do you mean?

325
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,666
What would you do if we said
we didn't feel like doing this?

326
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,958
I mean, think about it.

327
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,041
You can't make a movie
with just a director.

328
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,791
Don't worry about that!
I'm almost done with the script!

329
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,375
Yeah... I don't
think you understood

330
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,666
what I was talking about there.

331
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,750
Oh, come on, don't sweat
the small stuff.

332
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,750
Just follow my lead like always,
and everything will be fine!

333
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,875
You don't have to worry
about anything at all!

334
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:58,708
[KYON]
I'm worried.

335
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,125
Just leave everything to me!

336
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,708
I'm gonna plan
the whole thing out!

337
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,833
[KYON]
Now I'm really worried.

338
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,708
I said we're doing it,
and that's that.

339
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,500
Stop being so annoying.

340
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,833
Our goal is to be voted the
#1 event of the festival!

341
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,000
Maybe then, those jerks
in the student council

342
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,041
will recognize the SOS
Brigade as a legitimate club!

343
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,333
No, we're gonna
make 'em recognize us.

344
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,250
And to do that, we're gonna need
to get the public on our side.

345
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,000
And how are we gonna
pay for all this?

346
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,416
We'll just dip into our funds.

347
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,208
What funds?

348
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,250
[HARUHI] We've got
the literary club's money.

349
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,375
[KYON] But that's their
money for their projects.

350
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,083
You can't just
decide to take it.

351
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,125
Yuki, is it okay if
I have your money?

352
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,250
Yes.

353
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,833
[HARUHI]
Listen up, people!

354
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,500
Whatever your classes are doing,
this is more important!

355
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,666
If anyone thinks different,

356
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,583
we'll talk about it
after the festival.

357
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,333
The director's will is supreme!

358
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,916
Got it?!

359
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,750
[KYON] First, she's the brigade
leader. Now, she's a director.

360
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:01,125
What does she wanna be next?
Please, please don't say god.

361
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,166
[HARUHI]
Okay. We're done for today!

362
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,458
Since I'm producing this thing,
I've got a lot to think about!

363
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,791
We'll go over all
the details tomorrow.

364
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,708
[MIKURU sighs]

365
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,250
This isn't such a bad thing.
If you want to know the truth,

366
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,333
I'm actually quite
relieved this is happening.

367
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,708
It's not like we have to catch a
space monster for a slide show.

368
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,916
Or shoot down a UFO and
make an exhibit out of it.

369
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Besides, I'm a
little curious to see

370
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,250
what kind of movie Miss
Suzumiya wants to shoot.

371
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,833
This should make for
an interesting festival,

372
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,083
very interesting indeed.

373
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,125
D-Did you want something?

374
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,333
[KYON] Nothing... Just
wondering what kind of costume

375
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,250
Haruhi was gonna
bring in next, that's it.

376
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,958
Shooting a movie... Uh-oh.

377
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,500
[KYON]
A movie, huh?

378
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,708
To be honest, I was kind
of interested in the idea.

379
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,291
Not as much as Koizumi though.
I guess, at the very least,

380
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,541
I should try to be
more psyched about it.

381
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,833
[KYON] After all, I doubt
anyone's expecting much.

382
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,833
[KYON gasps]
I take back everything I said.

383
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,958
I shouldn't have been psyched.

384
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,083
Because the next day,
after school,

385
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,541
I became very, very sad.

386
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,041
So, what exactly am I
supposed to do on this thing?

387
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,083
[HARUHI]
Take a look; it's on the board.

388
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,500
Am I really supposed
to be the heroine?

389
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,041
Because if it's possible,
I'd like to play a part

390
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,625
that's less prominent...

391
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,458
[HARUHI] No way! You're gonna
play the flashiest role ever!

392
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,166
Besides, you're kinda
the brigade's mascot.

393
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,291
Oh! And you might wanna start
practicing your autograph!

394
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,625
When we have the premiere,

395
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,416
I bet you're gonna get
swarmed by a ton of fans!

396
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,666
[KYON] Where are you
gonna hold a premiere?

397
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,666
But, I've never acted
in anything before.

398
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,916
Don't worry about a thing!
I'm an awesome director!

399
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,333
[HARUHI giggles]

400
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,333
I am a little concerned about
Yuki and Koizumi though.

401
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,125
They know this
project takes priority,

402
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,500
but they're still in class.

403
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,041
I have to give them a
warning for showing up late.

404
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,041
[KYON] It's a little odd
that me and Miss Asahina

405
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,125
were here on time
and ready to go though.

406
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,333
Hm?

407
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,916
Miss Asahina, is it
okay that you're here

408
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,625
and not at your class meeting?

409
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,750
[MIKURU]
Mm-hmm.

410
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,125
Since I'm just going
to be a waitress,

411
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,916
all I have to do is get
fitted for my costume.

412
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,958
I'm kind of looking
forward to it.

413
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,500
Actually, I can't wait!

414
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,708
[KYON] Miss Asahina's
blushing smile proved

415
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,125
that she'd gotten
used to cosplaying.

416
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,583
Well, at least now, she'll get
to wear the proper costume

417
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,208
for the proper occasion.

418
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,416
More than she does for
the SOS Brigade, anyway.

419
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,125
If you really wanna
be a waitress,

420
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,958
I can totally make that happen!

421
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,666
I've got a buncha costumes
I can bring in for you!

422
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,416
Just let me know, okay?

423
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,666
By the way, Kyon, what's the
one thing every movie

424
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,250
has to have before
you start shooting?

425
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,500
[KYON]
Hmm...

426
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,291
I guess it would
be an original idea

427
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,250
and the passion to tell
a compelling story.

428
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,000
No, you need a camera.

429
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,500
How're we gonna shoot a
movie without a camera?

430
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,375
I wasn't looking for one
of your abstract answers.

431
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,583
[KYON] That's fine, but I
didn't wanna give you an answer

432
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,958
that sounded
too practical, either.

433
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,208
Whatever...

434
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,625
Here's what we're doing next:

435
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,458
Our mission is to go find
ourselves a video camera!

436
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,583
[thud]

437
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,500
[MIKURU whimpering]
M-Miss Suzumiya...

438
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,250
There's something I have to do,

439
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,625
so c-could I go
back to my class?

440
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,625
Shut up and sit down.

441
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,041
[MIKURU whimpers]

442
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,500
There's no need to worry!

443
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,750
[KYON]
I've yet to find an occasion

444
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,208
when you told us not to worry,

445
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,041
and we really didn't
have to worry.

446
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,791
[HARUHI] Look, it's not like
I'm gonna use your body

447
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,541
to pay for that stuff we need.

448
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,583
I just need your
help today, that's all.

449
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,250
[MIKURU whimpering]

450
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,166
You're gonna tell us
what you need her for.

451
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,541
If you don't, Miss Asahina and I

452
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,416
refuse to get outta
these chairs to help.

453
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,666
We have to go look for sponsors!
They'll take us more seriously

454
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,291
if we have the
lead actress there.

455
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,750
And you're gonna come, too.
I need some help carrying stuff.

456
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,250
[KYON]
It's supposed to be fall now,

457
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,375
but the temperature
hasn't cooled off.

458
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,583
I guess the planet has finally
gone completely insane,

459
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:27,041
'cause it forgot to switch the
season in Japan over to fall.

460
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,208
[KYON] After we finished
walking down the hill,

461
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,708
we hopped on the local line and
took it for about three stops.

462
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,291
Our destination wasn't too far

463
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,291
from that place with
the cherry trees,

464
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,208
where Miss Asahina and I
had that talk a while ago.

465
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,875
[train screeches]

466
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,666
We're here!

467
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,791
We are indeed.

468
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,125
[KYON]
I guess this is the store

469
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,875
she's planning on getting
all our equipment from.

470
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,250
I wonder how she's
gonna do it though.

471
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,458
You guys wait here.

472
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm gonna go inside
and talk to the guy.

473
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,541
Here! Hang onto this!

474
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,791
Okay.

475
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,000
[KYON]
I swear,

476
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,375
if Haruhi does anything
even remotely suspicious,

477
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,833
I'm gonna grab Miss
Asahina and split.

478
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,875
[KYON] I should probably warn
that relatively pleasant looking

479
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,791
man that nodding his head
at whatever Haruhi's saying

480
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,291
is a very, very bad idea.

481
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,250
I wonder what she's doing.

482
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,083
Dunno.

483
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,416
She's probably asking about

484
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,458
one of the high-end
digital cameras he's sells.

485
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,750
And knowing how she operates,

486
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,166
I bet she's tryin' to get
it for nothing, too.

487
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,458
[KYON]
She's definitely someone

488
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,833
who would try to do
something like that.

489
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,708
She's such a pain.

490
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,583
Haruhi thinks her ideals
and opinions are absolute.

491
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,375
And sometimes, she even
thinks other people

492
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,458
share her warped
views about things.

493
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,750
Well, actually, that pretty
much happens all the time,

494
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,958
so I guess you could
say she just doesn't get it.

495
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,041
If you wanna go faster
than the speed of light,

496
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,041
make sure Haruhi's
on your space ship.

497
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,750
She'd just ignore the
laws of relativity for you.

498
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,875
Look! I think they finished.

499
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,500
[HARUHI giggling]

500
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,750
[HARUHI]
Ta-da!

501
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,541
Our first mission was a success,
and we're right on schedule!

502
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,500
I wanna know how you
managed to get an expensive

503
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:21,833
camera like this for free.

504
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,166
I hope you're not doing
something crazy

505
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,208
like blackmailing
that poor old guy.

506
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,208
No way! I just explained
our situation to him,

507
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,750
and he gave it to me!

508
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,000
[KYON] If that's what really
happened, tell me what you said.

509
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,583
I want one, too.

510
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,833
[HARUHI] All I did was tell him
that we wanted to shoot a movie.

511
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,500
Then, he just gave me
the camera, no problem.

512
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,916
[KYON]
There's no problem now,

513
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,125
but I have a feeling
there will be later.

514
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,333
Oh, stop worrying so much!

515
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,166
All you have to do
is be my subordinate

516
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,208
and do whatever
I tell you to do.

517
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,958
[laughs]

518
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,000
[HARUHI] Come on! Let's go
to the next store!

519
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,208
[KYON]
I was beginning to understand.

520
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,125
Whenever Haruhi pointed at us,

521
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,875
she was actually pointing
at Miss Asahina.

522
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,750
I think the idea was for Miss
Asahina to be the currency

523
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,125
for all the stuff
Haruhi was getting.

524
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,791
I wonder if I should tell her.

525
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,083
[HARUHI]
Ta-da!

526
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,458
[KYON]
Now, what'd you get?

527
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,708
[HARUHI]
Weapons!

528
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:20,791
Here.

529
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,375
Ugh, what am I
gonna do with these?!

530
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,375
We're gonna use 'em
for our action scenes.

531
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:27,416
Nothing's more entertaining
than flashy gun-fighting action!

532
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,166
In fact, I was even thinking we
could blow up a whole building!

533
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,708
Which reminds me,
do you know any place

534
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,500
where we can get some dynamite?

535
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,000
How 'bout that shop
on the corner?

536
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,333
How would I know?

537
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,541
I'm pretty sure you can't
buy it online though.

538
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,875
What am I supposed to do
with all this stuff anyway?

539
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,916
It's too late to go back
to school with it now,

540
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,541
so just take it home!

541
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,875
Don't forget to bring it to the
club room tomorrow though, okay?

542
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:47,625
Really?

543
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:48,916
Yeah, really.

544
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
[HARUHI] That's her
special SOS Brigade smile,

545
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,125
the one you don't
see in class too often.

546
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,208
When I see that smile,

547
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,541
I know I'll be doing
damage control

548
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,166
after some catastrophe
she's caused.

549
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,208
I'm like the Anti-Straw
Millionaire!

550
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:02,958
Excuse me?
