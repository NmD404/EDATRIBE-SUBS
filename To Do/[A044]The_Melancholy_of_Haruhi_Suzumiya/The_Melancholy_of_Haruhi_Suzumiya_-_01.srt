1
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,458
[KYON]
Okay.

2
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,083
Asking somebody how long they've
believed in Santa Claus

3
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,083
is so stupid,
you can't even consider it

4
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,041
a topic suitable for
idle conversation.

5
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,625
But if you still
wanna know how long

6
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,416
I've believe in some old, fat
guy who wears a funky red suit,

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,166
I can tell you this:

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,583
I've never believed
in him... ever.

9
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,000
The Santa that showed up at my

10
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,750
kindergarten Christmas festival?
I knew he was fake.

11
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,708
And I never saw Mommy
kissing Santa or anything.

12
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,958
But I have to say that
even as a little kid,

13
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,916
I knew better than to
believe in some old man

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that only worked one day a year.

15
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,458
Now, having said that,
it wasn't until I got older

16
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,208
that I realized aliens, time
travelers, ghosts, monsters,

17
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,666
ESPers, evil syndicates,

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,375
and the anime slash manga
slash fantasy-flick heroes

19
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,708
that fight said evil
syndicates... were also fake.

20
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,250
Okay, I guess I always knew
those things were bogus,

21
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,750
I just didn't want to admit it.

22
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,833
All I ever wanted was for an
alien, time traveler, ghost,

23
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,583
monster, ESPer, evil syndicate
or the hero who fought 'em

24
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,375
to just appear and say, "Hey."

25
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:30,500
Unfortunately, reality
is a hard road indeed.

26
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,500
Yep, you gotta admit,
the laws of physics

27
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,416
definitely puts
a damper on things.

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,000
I even stopped
watching those TV shows

29
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,125
about aliens and
ghosts and stuff.

30
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,458
Aliens, time travelers, ESPers,
'course they don't exist.

31
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,791
But a little part of me
wishes that they did.

32
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,333
I guess I've grown up
and realized

33
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,750
that I can think
about those things

34
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,208
and still accept reality.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
[KYON] But by the time
I got out of junior high,

36
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,166
I pretty much outgrew
that kinda stuff.

37
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,458
And I guess I got
used to the idea of

38
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,500
living in an ordinary world.

39
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,083
And just like that--
I was in high school.

40
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,500
And that's when I met her...

41
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,541
I'm Haruhi Suzumiya
from East Junior High.

42
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,583
First off, I'm not interested
in ordinary people.

43
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,916
But if any of you are aliens,
time travelers, or ESPers,

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,250
please come see me. That is all.

45
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,583
[KYON]
Is that supposed to be funny?

46
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,625
[KYON] There stood before me
this amazing, beautiful girl.

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,166
Uh...

48
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,458
[gasping]

49
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,000
O-kay... Next?

50
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,333
[KYON] I bet everyone
thought she was kidding,

51
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,750
but it wasn't a joke.

52
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,791
And it wasn't anything
to laugh about.

53
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,333
Haruhi is always dead serious.

54
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,583
And that's how we first met.

55
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,541
Looking back, I wanna believe
that it was just a coincidence.

56
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,625
[KYON] As long as Haruhi
Suzumiya is sitting quietly,

57
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,833
she's just like any other
extremely beautiful

58
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,541
high school girl.

59
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,250
And my seat just happens
to be in front of her.

60
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,958
I mean, can you
blame me for wanting

61
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,333
to exploit this seating
arrangement so I could, um...

62
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,625
get to know her better?

63
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,500
Hey, that stuff you were
saying when you were

64
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,333
introducing yourself,
were you serious about all that?

65
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,916
What about the stuff
I was saying?

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,375
[KYON] Well, you know,
about aliens and stuff.

67
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,166
Why? Are you an alien
or something?

68
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,333
[KYON]
Well, no, but I just--

69
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,458
Well, no, but you just what?

70
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, I-- Just forget it.

71
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,833
Then why are we even
talking right now?

72
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,375
You're wasting my time. Ugh.

73
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:09,458
[KYON]
Hmm?

74
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,625
[chuckling]

75
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,958
[KYON]
Later on,

76
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,291
I found out that quite
a few of my new classmates

77
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,000
were from the same
junior high as Haruhi.

78
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,750
[TANIGUCHI] Look, if you've
got the hots for her,

79
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,208
take my advice:

80
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,625
Forget it.

81
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,125
After being in the same class
as her for three years,

82
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,291
I know her pretty well.

83
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,208
Let's just say she's what you
might call beyond eccentric.

84
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,416
Like her introduction?

85
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,708
Yep! In junior high,
I can't remember a day

86
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,583
when she wasn't doing
something completely wacky.

87
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,833
You ever hear the quad
scribbles incident?

88
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,375
No, what's that?

89
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,625
You know that thing that draws
lines on the athletic field?

90
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,458
Agh, what d'ya call
that thing again?

91
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,541
Whatever. Well, she used
that thing to draw

92
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,000
this big, mysterious symbol
on the school quad.

93
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,541
She snuck into the school
grounds at night to draw it.

94
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,208
Yeah, I remember
reading about that.

95
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,000
I think it was in the local
section of the daily newspaper.

96
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,583
It sorta looked like
a botched version

97
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,083
of a Nazca drawing, didn't it?

98
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,625
[KYON] So, you're telling me
she did this all by herself?

99
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,333
[TANIGUCHI] No doubt. And she
totally admitted doing it.

100
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,083
Oh yeah, and then one morning,
I get to class early.

101
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,500
All the desks were
shoved out into the hall!

102
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,958
Then there's the time she
painted a star on the roof.

103
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,708
And this other time when she
plastered these talismans...

104
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,583
[KYON]
What the hell's she doing...?

105
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,833
[TANIGUCHI]
You know,

106
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,041
like the ones you use
to reanimate corpses?

107
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,875
I have no idea why.

108
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,666
But all the same, man, she's
pretty popular with the guys.

109
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,666
She's not too hard
to look at, you know?

110
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,500
And she's freakin'
good at sports.

111
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,666
And, on top of that,
she gets good grades.

112
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,125
She's a super weirdo.

113
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,750
But if she's standing there
quietly, you'd never know.

114
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,000
[KUNIKIDA] Somethin' tells me
you have more to say about her.

115
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,250
[TANIGUCHI]
For a while,

116
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,958
she was goin' out with
one joker after another.

117
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,625
I think the longest any one
guy lasted was about a week.

118
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,041
And the guy that had the
shortest relationship with her?

119
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,500
He asked her out,
she said okay,

120
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,000
and it ended five minutes later.

121
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,916
I don't have any time to deal
with ordinary humans!

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,583
[TANIGUCHI] Then why the hell'd
you say okay?

123
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,625
Hmm?

124
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,541
I mean, that's what
I heard, really!

125
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,875
I don't know why, but she
never turns a guy down

126
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,416
when he steps up to ask her out.

127
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,041
And so, before you get any
bright ideas, buddy,

128
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,041
take my advice:

129
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,291
forget it.

130
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,000

Forget it? What's to forget

131
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,291
when I haven't even
though about it?

132
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,125
[TANIGUCHI] If you were me,
there's only one girl

133
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,708
in this class to go after.
And that's her.

134
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,291
[TANIGUCHI] Ryoko Asakura.
And I'm telling ya,

135
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,416
she's in the top 3 on the
freshman hottie list.

136
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,541
So what, are you telling us that
you've already checked out

137
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,708
all the freshman girls?

138
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,041
Heck yeah! I ranked
'em all from A to D

139
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,500
and I even went so far as
to memorize the full names

140
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,166
of all the A-list girls, buddy.

141
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,083
Really? So what ranking
did Asakura get?

142
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,750
She gets Double-A plus!

143
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,375
On top of being gorgeous, I bet
her personality is wonderful.

Now, all this was happening

147
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,791
when Haruhi Suzumiya was
still acting sorta normal.

148
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,458
For that whole month, even
I was feeling pretty good.

149
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,583
However, it should be noted
that bits and pieces

150
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,958

were already starting

151

A different hairstyle everyday.

00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,166
As the days passed,
the number of places

159
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,750
she'd tie off her
hair increased.

160
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,416
On Monday, she resets her hair,

161
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,916
and then adds off a tie-off
point each day until Friday.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,875
Wonder what her hair
looks like on Sunday.

163
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,625

Our PE classe is seperated

When changing into uniforms,

girls use the odd
numbered classrooms

168
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,833
and boys used the even numbers.

169
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,166
It didn't matter that guys
were standing around,

170
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,000
she'd just start changing
out of her school uniform.

To Haruhi, guys were pretty much

173
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,208
the same as a bag of potatoes.

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,958
[KYON] Eccentricity number 3:
It was rather irritating

175
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,541
that Haruhi joined
every team in

176
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,000
every extra-curricular club
the school had to offer.

177
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,083
Every single one of
the sports clubs lobbied

178
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,041
for her to join their
respective teams,

179
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,291
and she'd turned
every one of 'em down.

180
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,541
She'd change clubs on a daily
basis depending on her mood.

181
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,375
In the end though,
she didn't remain a member

182
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,333
of a single one of the clubs.

183
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,458
I mean, what the hell does
she wanna do anyway?

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
[KYON] And before I knew it,
it was the day after

185
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:15,958
the Golden Week vacation.

186
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,500
[TANIGUCHI]
Kyon! What's up?

187
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,833
Hey.

188
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,333
[KYON] And by the way, Kyon?
That's my nickname.

189
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,458
And I really wish people would
stop calling me that already.

190
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,708
[KYON] Oh. I guess today's
Wednesday, isn't it?

191
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:34,250
And with that thought, something
must've snapped inside me.

192
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,833
I can't think of
any reason why...

193
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,750
So, do you cahnge
your hairstyle everyday

194
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,500
to ward off alien invaders?

195
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,041
[KYON] I was talking
to Haruhi Suzumiya.

196
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,375
So when did you notice?

197
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,625
[KYON]
Mmm... A while ago.

198
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,916
Oh, I see.

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,375
Actually, I have this theory
that each day of the week

200
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,375
has its own image
with a specific color

201
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,833
that only goes with that day.
And by colors, I'd say...

202
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,541
[KYON] It felt almost
like we were having a

203
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,500
real conversation
for the first time.

204
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,708
...and Thursday's green.
Friday is gold,

205
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,875
and Saturday is brown. And
the color for Sunday is white.

206
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,541
[KYON] Hey, I kinda understand
what she's talking about.

207
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,583
[KYON] So, if you
turn that into numbers,

208
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,250
Monday'd be zero, and
Sunday'd be six, right?

209
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,791
Right.

210
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,958
[KYON] I kinda feel that
Monday's more like a one.

211
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,625
I don't think anybody was
asking for your opinion.

212
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,833
[KYON]
Oh, is that so?

213
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,666
[KYON]
Hm.

214
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,125
Have I met you somewhere before?

215
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,583
Like, maybe in the past,
or something like that?

216
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,666
Not likely.

217
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,000
[exhales]

218
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,875
[KYON] Usually, an event
is triggered by something

219
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,583
that's considered trivial.

220
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,666
Well, this must've
been my trigger.

221
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,666
I was surprised that
Haruhi even replied

222
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,125
with a half-decent answer.

223
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,708
I totally thought she'd
say something like,

224
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,666
"

225
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,208
I mean, you get the picture...

226
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,500
[KYON] And so, when Haruhi
came to class the next day

227
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,541
with her long hair
all chopped off,

228
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,791
I was rather disturbed by it.

229
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,416
I mean, cutting
it short like that

230
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,250
the day after I
made my comment...

231
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,416
It's a little rash,
don't you think?

232
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,791
Not really.

233
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,625
[KYON]
Ever since that day,

234
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,458
talking to Haruhi right
before homeroom started

235
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,458
was becoming sort of a ritual.

236
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:25,000
[KYON] Is it true you've dumped
every guy you've ever dated?

237
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,375
And just what
gives you the right

238
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,750
to ask me a question like that?

239
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,833
I don't know about
anything you've heard.

240
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,791
Whatever. You wanna believe it?
It's probably true.

241
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,166
Well, with all that dating,
wasn't there at least one guy

242
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,833
you were even a
little serious about?

243
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,000
Absolutely not.

244
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,083
They all took themselves
way too seriously,

245
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,208
and not even one of those dorks
was an alien, time traveler,

246
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,583
or even an ESPer.

247
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,958
[KYON]
That's how people are normally.

248
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,333
Okay, so what's
with most of them

249
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,875
asking me out over the phone?

250
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,500
I mean, shouldn't important
stuff like that

251
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,750
be done face-to-face,
not phone-to-phone?

252
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,041
Yeah, I mean, if it were me...

253
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,083
[KYON] I'll just agree
with her for now.

254
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,125
Yeah, well, none of that's
important anyway!

255
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,375
[KYON]
So what is?

256
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,583
Here's the problem:

257
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,666
So far, the way it looks
is that all the men

258
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,833
in this entire universe
are pathetic.

259
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,208
I mean, all through
junior high,

260
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,541
that was the one thing that
irritated me the most.

261
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,125
All right then,
so what kind of guy

262
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,166
would you have really have been
into? An alien or something?

263
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,750
[HARUHI]
Yeah! Anything like an alien

264
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,666
or something else
along those lines.

265
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,291
Anyway, as long as the person
isn't an ordinary human,

266
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,791
I don't care if it's
a boy or a girl.

267
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,583
Hang on a sec,
what's wrong with being human?

268
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,500
I mean, why do they
have to be an alien?

269
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,291
Because that way,
life's more interesting.

270
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,333
[school bell chimes]

271
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,458
[KYON sighs]

272
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,750
Hey, Kyon!

273
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,750
You need to tell me what kind
of magic spell you're using.

274
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,083
[KYON]
What're you talking about?

275
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,666
I have never seen Suzumiya
talk that long before,

276
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,416
and I'm not exaggerating, man!

277
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,166
What the hell'd you say to her?

278
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,250
[KYON]
Huh...

279
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,041
Wonder what I could've
said to her.

280
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,125
I think it was all
pretty random stuff.

281
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,750
This is a phenomenon.

282
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,708
Kyon's always gone after
the strange ones;

283
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,333
the weirder the better.

284
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,666
Little louder, please,
so everyone can hear you.

285
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,791
[ASAKURA]
I wanna know how you did it.

286
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,583
No matter how much
I've tried to talk to her,

287
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,708
I can't get Haruhi to answer
any of my questions.

288
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,583
What do you do to
get her to open up?

289
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,916
Do you have any tips for me?

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,250
No idea.

291
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,875
[ASAKURA] Hmm... Still,
I think it's a good thing.

292
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,000
I've been sorta worried
about her always being

293
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,583
completely alone in our class.

294
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,000
I think it's really great she's
made at least one friend here.

295
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,208
A friend, huh?

296
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,291
Well, just keep doing
whatever you're doing,

297
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,416
cause maybe she'll warm
up to the rest of us.

298
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,166
I mean, since we're all
in the same class,

299
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,208
it'd be really for the best
if everyone got a long,

300
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,583
and that's why
I'm counting on you.

301
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,583
[KYON]
Easy for you to say.

302
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,791
In fact, from now on,

303
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,166
if there's anything we
need to say to her,

304
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,916
we'll just talk to you,
and you can tell her for us.

305
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,125
[growls]

306
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,041
Hey, hang on a sec!
What do ya think I am;

307
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,875
am I supposed to be your
spokesperson or something?!

308
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,666
Pretty please?

309
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,291
[giggling]

310
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,791
[gasps]

311
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,125
Kyon, we're buddies, aren't we?
We're pals, right?

312
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,750
[KYON]
Everyone's turned into an idiot.

313
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,750
Apparently we're changing seats.

314
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,083
I picked a number out of a
cookie tin that gave me the seat

315
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,916
next to the window
second from the back.

316
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,208
An awesome seat if I may say so.

317
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:17,208
Farewell, Haruhi. Forever.

318
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,041
Coincidence?

319
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,375
[KYON] Hey, I heard you checked
out all the clubs at school.

320
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,041
Give me a heads up
if you know about

321
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,416
any interesting ones, okay?

322
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,791
Absolutely none.

323
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,041
[KYON]
An instant reply.

324
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,583
Absolutely none!

325
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,458
[KYON] It seems she likes to use
the word "absolutely" a lot.

326
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,083
I thought things would
get a little better

327
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,333
when I got into highschool,
but it's the same here

328
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,041
as it's been throughout all
these mandatory school years.

329
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,291
Maybe I'm just in
the wrong school.

330
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,333
[KYON] I sorta wonder
what her criteria are.

331
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,916
There was a club called the
"Mystery Research Club."

332
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,291
[KYON]
Yeah? How was that?

333
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,375
It was hilarious.
They told me they've never

334
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,833
had anything they could
even remotely call a case.

335
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,750
And the members were a bunch
of mystery novel otakus.

336
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,791
Definitely not
master detectives.

337
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,916
[KYON]
Well, that figures.

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,500
Yeah, well I had high hopes for

339
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,083
the Supernatural Phenomenon
Research Club, too,

340
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,458
but that thing was just
a bunch of occult freaks.

341
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,583
What do you think of it?

342
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,541
I don't think about it.

343
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,583
Oh man! I'm so bored!

344
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,541
With all these clubs, you'd
think they're be a couple of

345
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,500
really strange cool
ones out there.

346
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,291
Listen, you can't help
it if there aren't any.

347
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,500
Besides, us normal human types,
we gotta be happy

348
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,958
with what we're given, you know
what I'm saying?

349
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,500
You could look at it this way:

350
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,250
the people who don't like what
they got are the same people

351
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,791
who invent things
and make discoveries

352
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,166
and advance civilization.

353
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,083
They made airplanes 'cause
they wanted to fly,

354
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,041
and they made cars and trains
'cause they wanted to go

355
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,625
from place to place.
It's as simple as that.

356
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,125
The only reason that we've got
all the things we have now

357
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,125
is because a certain group
of people got together

358
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,916
and used their talent
or imagination

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
or genius or whatever
to make it all possible.

360
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,250
Ordinary people are
probably better off

361
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,666
living their ordinary,
little lives

362
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,583
in an ordinary manner.

363
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,916
Shut up.

364
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,208
[KYON]
Hmm?

365
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,333
[growls]

366
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,416
[KYON]
Perhaps it was this conversation

367
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,208
that sparked the idea...

368
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,083
[KYON]
It happened suddenly.

369
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,041
[grunts]

370
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,458
[whimpers]

371
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,583
What's wrong with you?!

372
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,916
I got an idea!

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,083
About what?

374
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,250
I can't believe I didn't
realize it before!

375
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,500
It's so obvious!

376
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,875
What is?

377
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,041
If it doesn't exist,
I should just make it myself!

378
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,458
Make what yourself?

379
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,041
Make a club!

380
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,833
[sighs]

381
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,333
I hear ya, but you gotta
calm down, all right?

382
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,375
What's with you?! This is
what we're talkin' about!

383
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,833
You should be happy you're
about this development.

384
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,541
Well... we're in the
middle of class.

385
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,041
[chuckles nervously]

386
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,000
Hmm?

387
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,958
[school bell chimes]

388
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,500
You're gonna help.

389
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,083
[KYON] I feel like I'm being
bullied outta my lunch money.

390
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,125
What d'ya need help with?

391
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,250
Starting my new club,
that's what!

392
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,958
First, tell me why I'm the
one who's gotta help you

393
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,250
set up a club that's your
idea in the first place.

394
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,666
And you can let go
of the tie, now.

395
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,541
I'll find us a room
and some members,

396
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,833
and I want you to personally
handle all the paperwork...

397
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,791
[KYON]
She's not listening.

398
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,250
Why don't you tell me what
kind of club it's gonna be.

399
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,000
[HARUHI]
Who cares about that right now?!

400
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,750
We've gotta go
make the club first!

401
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,875
You got it? Do all that stuff
before school ends today.

402
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,916
I'll find a room for
the club by then!

403
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,541
Okie-dokie?

404
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,666
[KYON] Rules for the creation of
a new extra-curricular group...

405
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,041
At least five members,
a teacher to supervise,

406
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,708
a name, the name of
the person in charge,

407
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,541
the purpose of the organization.

408
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,333
There's nothing for me to do.

409
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,916
It's all in the back of
the student handbook.

410
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,666
And I can bet money on this:

411
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,916
Haruhi's little scheme?
Nothing about it's gonna

412
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,708
contribute to making school life
more creative or more fun.

413
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,583
Of that I'm positive.

414
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,541
This is going to be
our new clubroom!

415
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,583
[KYON] Hang on, I don't even
know where we are right now.

416
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,583
This is the cultural department!

417
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,208
The art club's got the art room,

418
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,583
and the wind ensemble has got
the music room, am I right?

419
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,000
Club's that don't need
specialized classrooms like that

420
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,416
end up in this wing of
the cultural department.

421
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
They call it the old building.

422
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,041
This room's for
the literary club.

423
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,875
[KYON] So then it's the
literary club's room.

424
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,125
Yeah, I know, I know,
but this past spring

425
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,708
all the senior members left, so
now the club's got no members.

426
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,875
And if nobody else joins,
then that club's gonna be cut.

427
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,458
Oh, and this girl's
a new freshman member.

428
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,500
[KYON] So, the club
hasn't been cut then.

429
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,791
It's the same difference.

430
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,708
Besides, she's
the only one here.

431
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,333
But what're we gonna
do with her?

432
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,208
She told me that
she wouldn't mind it.

433
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,583
You sure about that?

434
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,291
[HARUHI] When I saw her
at lunch, I asked her

435
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,708
if we could use the club room.

436
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,958
She said go ahead.
She doesn't really care as long

437
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,916
as she has a place to read.

438
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,625
I guess some folks are just
strange like that, you know?

439
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,208
[KYON]
Look who's talking...

440
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,541
Yuki Nagato...

441
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,416
[KYON]
Miss... Nagato, was it?

442
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,750
You understand my colleague
here wants to use this room

443
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,541
for some other type of club.
Are you okay with that?

444
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,375
I'm fine.

445
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,625
You are?

446
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,125
O-Okay, but I'm pretty
sure we're gonna end up

447
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,666
causing you a lot
of trouble though.

448
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,000
No problem.

449
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,000
But someday you might get
kicked out of this room.

450
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,458
Go ahead.

451
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,083
[HARUHI]
Well, there you have it!

452
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,250
From now on, we're gonna
meet here in this room

453
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,625
right after school.

454
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,708
And ya better show up, mister,
'cause if you don't

455
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,833
it's the death penalty!

456
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,083
Understood.

457
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,333
[KYON]
I don't wanna die.

458
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,500
We need to find club members.

459
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,916
We're gonna need at
least two more people.

460
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,583
[KYON] What, that means
you already have that

461
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,875
literary club girl included
in the head count?

462
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,833
Does Haruhi think she
comes with the room

463
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,750
like some kind of accessory?

464
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,833
Don't worry,
I'll get 'em in no time.

465
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,500
I gotta couple leads on some
random people I can bring in.

466
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,416
[school bell chimes]

467
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,041
[KYON]
And so, the next day...

468
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,791
I'll meet ya there!

469
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,625
[KYON]
I guess I had no choice.

470
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,458
I found myself shuffling
over to the club room.

471
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,500
[KYON]
So, whatcha readin'?

472
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,958
[KYON]
Is it interesting?

473
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,458
Unique.

474
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,375
[KYON]
So, what part's unique?

475
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,625
All of it.

476
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,833
[KYON]
Huh, you really like books.

477
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,125
A little...

478
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,375
[KYON]
I see...

479
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,166
Can I go home now?

480
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,333
Sorry about that!

481
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,791
I'm a little late today
'cause it took me

482
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,750
forever to catch her.

483
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,333
[KYON] It was another girl.
A really beautiful girl.

484
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,166
What is this? Where am I?

485
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,083
W-Why did you bring me here?

486
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,916
Who are you people anyway?

487
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,708
Why are you locking the door?!

488
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,916
What do you want from me?!

489
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,333
[HARUHI]
Just be quiet.

490
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,625
Allow me to introduce
Mikuru Asahina.

491
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,208
[whimpers]

492
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,333
[HARUHI]
Hmm.

493
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,250
[KYON]
So much for introductions.

494
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,000
[KYON]
Where did you kidnap her from?

495
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,666
I didn't kidnap anyone,
she came here on her own.

496
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,916
[KYON]
Same difference.

497
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,875
I caught this one
daydreaming her brains out

498
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,208
in the junior's classroom.

499
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,750
During recess,
I make it a point

500
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,750
to walk every inch
of the main building.

501
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,000
I remembered seeing her around
a couple of times, and, well,

502
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,416
here she is.

503
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,791
[KYON] So that's why I haven't
seen her during recess.

504
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,250
Unbelievable.

505
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,333
Uh, hang on a second,
did you say she was a junior?

506
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,625
Well, so what if she is?

507
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,833
Yeah... Um, it's
Miss Asahina, wasn't it?

508
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,500
Why pick her of all people then?

509
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,875
What're you, blind?
Just look at her!

510
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,333
She's a total little cutie!

511
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,750
[KYON] Great. Now she
sounds like a pervert.

512
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,041
In this situation,

513
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,666
moe is an important
concept to keep in mind.

514
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,333
[KYON]
Sorry, what'd you say?

515
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,666
Moe! Moe!

516
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,708
This girl's a prime
example of moe.

517
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,583
It's a rule that in stories
with strange things going on,

518
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,583
you need to have
one moe character.

519
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,625
Someone with glasses
or in a maid costume,

520
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,083
or anything fetish-y.
It's essential.

521
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,250
And that's just the beginning!

522
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,750
[screams]

523
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,333
[HARUHI] She's tiny, but she's
got bigger breasts than me!

524
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,708
I mean, look at these things!
They're immense!

525
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,000
This is another important
aspect of moe!

526
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,125
[KYON]
Indeed...

527
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,958
[HARUHI]
Man, these suckers are huge!

528
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,416
It kinda pisses me off.

529
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,958
I mean, she's so cute
and her boobies

530
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,875
are ginormous compared to mine.

531
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,208
What're you, an idiot?

532
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,625
But they're totally
huge! Really!

533
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,750
You wanna feel 'em for yourself?

534
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,333
I think I'm gonna pass.

535
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,000
So Haruhi, you brought
this girl, Miss Asahina,

536
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,083
all the way up here just
because she happens to be

537
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,208
cute, tiny, and extremely
well-endowed?

538
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,708
Is that what you're
trying to tell me?

539
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,791
That's right!

540
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,750
[KYON]
She truly is an idiot.

541
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,166
I figured what the club needs
more than anything is a mascot.

542
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,333
Mikuru, are you a member of any
other school clubs right now?

543
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,041
The calligraphy club...

544
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,500
Oh, you can quit that one.

545
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,125
It'll just get in the way
of our club's activities.

546
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,958
Well...

547
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,708
Okay...

548
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,000
I understand...

549
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,250
[KYON]
What did she understand?

550
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,208
I'm going to quit
the calligraphy club

551
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,708
and join this one.

552
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,875
However, I don't really know
what the literary club does,

553
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,750
could you at least tell me that?

554
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,708
We're not the
literary club, Mikuru.

555
00:22:58,791 --> 00:22:59,958
Huh?

556
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,250
We're sorta borrowing this
clubroom for now,

557
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,708
and the group you're about
to join is something

558
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,416
that Suzumiya is
gonna be starting up,

559
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,583
and so far she hasn't figured
out a name and has

560
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:09,541
absolutely no idea what we're
gonna be doing here anyway.

561
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,583
Oh, and by the way, the girl
siting over there

562
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,291
reading the book is the real
literary club member.

563
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,541
Oh...

564
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,958
Okay, I've got it!

565
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,416
I just figured out what we're
gonna call ourselves!

566
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,583
Well, spit it out.

567
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,333
May I have your
attention please.

568
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,583
The name of the hereto for
nameless start up club

569
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,291
has just been decided
and its name is...

570
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,708
The SOS Brigade!

571
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,625
[KYON] The "Spreading Excitement
All Over the World

572
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,458
With Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade."

573
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,541
The SOS Brigade for short.

574
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:42,041
Yeah... It's okay to laugh now.

575
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,166
[KYON] Actually, the name
should be something like,

576
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,791
"Spreading Excitement
All Over the World

577
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,708
With Haruhi Suzumiya
Organization,"

578
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,333
but we don't have the right
to form an organization yet.

579
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:54,375
And we still don't know what
the point of this club is.

580
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,250
Brigade'll have to
do then, won't it?

581
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,666
[KYON] And with that
baffling statement,

582
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,541
the name of the club
was decided.

583
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,000
Yay...

584
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,708
Just do whatever you want.
