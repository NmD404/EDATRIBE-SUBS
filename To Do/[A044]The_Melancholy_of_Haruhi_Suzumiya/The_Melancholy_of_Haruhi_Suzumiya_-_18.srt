1
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,333
[KYON]
Wrong...

2
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:36,041
Wrong.

3
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,833
Wrong!

4
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:42,583
Something's wrong.
That's what it felt like anyway.

5
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,666
The game on TV was between
schools from another town.

6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,500
Now I had nothing to
do with either school,

7
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:51,041
but I found myself rooting for
the losing team anyway.

8
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,375
And it was right about then,

9
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,583
I suddenly got the feeling
Haruhi was gonna call.

10
00:00:55,666 --> 00:01:04,000
[phone rings]

11
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,291
Hey Kyon, your phone's ringing.

12
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,291
I know; you don't
have to tell me.

13
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,500
[phone rings]

14
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,833
[sighs]

15
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,333
[HARUHI]
Hey, you're free, right? Good.

16
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:19,083
Meet us at 2:00 in front of
the station. And don't be late!

17
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,500
[dial tone]

18
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,375
[KYON] I didn't even have
a chance to say anything.

19
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,125
[phone rings]

20
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,375
[gasps]

21
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,875
Yeah, what?

22
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,333
[HARUHI]
I forgot to tell you,

23
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:31,166
make sure to bring your swim
trunks and lots of money.

24
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,333
Oh, and bring your bike.
Definitely bring your bike.

25
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,291
I guess that's it. Over and out!

26
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,291
[dial tone]

27
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,250
[KYON]
That's two for two.

28
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,750
[sighs]

29
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,083
[KYON]
That was weird.

30
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,708
It was like I knew what
Haruhi was gonna say

31
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,458
before she said it.

32
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah... No...

33
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,000
Actually, it felt like we'd had
that exact same conversation

34
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:53,791
once before, kinda like
déjà vu or something.

35
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:54,875
--[metal clink]
--[cheering]

36
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,250
[COMMENTATOR]
Ooh, what a shot!

37
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:59,916
It's a big, fat hit headin'
straight for left field!

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,750
And it is over
the fence! Home run!

39
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,000
Chalk up another run for Jonah.

40
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,625
That makes eight
so far this game.

41
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:08,958
Kashima rounding third...

42
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,083
[KYON]
Summer's almost over...

43
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,000
[HARUHI]
You're late, Kyon!

44
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,000
Where's your motivation, huh?

45
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,208
[KYON]
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,458
I'm sorry to keep you
guys waiting for me.

47
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,875
No worries,
I just got here, too!

48
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,333
Okay, now that we're all present
and accounted for, we can go!

49
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,375
Where to?

50
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,625
To the public swimming pool.
Where do ya think?

51
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,208
[KYON] That figures...
considering the stuff I brought.

52
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,375
We've got lots of summer
vacation-y things

53
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,000
to do during our summer break!

54
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,541
But we've only so
much time because

55
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,833
once it's gone,
it's gone for good!

56
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,375
So we're gonna do everything
we can, while we can,

57
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,208
during our only summer
as tenth graders!

58
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,958
And for starters, we're gonna
ride the bikes to the pool!

59
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,250
[KYON] Okay, but did everyone
ride their bikes?

60
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:26,000
No, the only bikes we have today
are the ones you and I brought.

61
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,500
Huh?

62
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,083
All right, Kyon, you can't
let Koizumi beat you!

63
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,833
Come on! Full speed ahead!

64
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,250
[KYON panting]

65
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,916
Why's it takin' so long,
you guys?

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,375
Hurry up and park
the bikes already!

67
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,625
Hm?

68
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,875
Seriously, Kyon, we're
tryin' to have fun here,

69
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,416
so stop acting tired.

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,916
[KYON]
Whose fault is that, huh?!

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,250
[HARUHI]
Aah, can you smell the chlorine?

72
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,750
That really makes
it feel like summer!

73
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,833
Come on, let's go for a swim!

74
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,750
You and me are
gonna have a race!

75
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,750
[MIKURU]
Miss Suzumiya, wait!

76
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,541
[HARUHI screams, laughs]

77
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,458
[water splashes]

78
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,666
Doesn't that look like fun?

79
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,041
Sure does.

80
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,125
[KOIZUMI]
In a way, it makes me smile.

81
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,541
It's such a peaceful scene,
don't you think?

82
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,000
I mean, look at them.

83
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,541
Seein' Miss Suzumiya enjoy
the day in a normal fashion,

84
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,875
it's charming, isn't it?

85
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,291
Well, she called me up
and told me what to bring.

86
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,708
Then, she demanded I meet her

87
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,500
without telling me
what was going on.

88
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,916
There's nothing charming
or normal about it.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Well, if you want my opinion,

90
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,458
none of what you said is
anything to make a fuss over.

91
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,791
I mean, as long as Miss
Suzumiya's laughing

92
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,375
and havin' a good time,

93
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,208
we don't have to worry about any
earth-shattering events, do we?

94
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,750
[KYON]
Man, I hope you're right.

95
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,875
[KOIZUMI gasps]

96
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,375
Something wrong?

97
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,416
Nothing...

98
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,625
[chuckles]

99
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,750
Just my imagination, I guess.

100
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,833
With everything that's
happened since we met,

101
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,625
you could say I've become
slightly paranoid.

102
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,166
[gasps]

103
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,250
Oh! I lost again!

104
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,458
Yuki, one more time! Come on!

105
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,750
[MIKURU gasping]

106
00:05:58,833 --> 00:05:59,833
[screams]

107
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:00,583
[laughing]

108
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,416
I'm comin' to get you!

109
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,375
[HARUHI mumbling]
Mikuru! This is delicious!

110
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,916
[KYON]
Geez...

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,791
Now I know why they call it
a "public" swimming pool.

112
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,583
Seems like everyone
in town's here today.

113
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,583
I wonder why Haruhi
chose this place.

114
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,958
Hm?

115
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,416
[KYON]
Geez...

116
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,416
Now I know why they call it
a "public" swimming pool.

117
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,833
Seems like everyone
in town's here today.

118
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,833
I wonder why Haruhi
chose this place.

119
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,041
Hm?

120
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,500
[KYON gasps]

121
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,000
Something weird's happening...

122
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,375
[KYON]
Yeah... That's right.

123
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,833
She shows up and says...

124
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,958
[BOTH] "These two guys
are my brigade members.

125
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,208
They do what I say,

126
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,416
so if you want something,
you can ask them!"

127
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,708
It's time for some fun!

128
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,708
Let's go play water soccer!

129
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,666
Yeah, we're coming.

130
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,250
[KYON] Oh, well.
Sometimes déjà vu's happen.

131
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,333
[KYON]
What... is that?

132
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,875
I came up with this schedule of

133
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,416
how we're gonna spend the
rest of our summer vacation!

134
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,166
I realized something...

135
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,750
We've only got two more weeks
of summer vacation left to go!

136
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,500
So, we're gonna start
pickin' up the pace!

137
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,833
[KYON]
Two weeks to do all that?!

138
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,583
Mikuru, is there anything
else you wanna do?

139
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,666
[MIKURU]
Hm?

140
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,666
Um...

141
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,291
I think I'd like to try
goldfish scooping.

142
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,583
Okay!

143
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,958
Goldfish... scooping... it is!

144
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,333
Perfect!

145
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,166
Pardon me, but could I
see that for a moment?

146
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,416
Okay, sure...

147
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:44,666
Thank you.

148
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, you done with it?

149
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,250
[KOIZUMI]
Mhm.

150
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,333
[HARUHI] Okay, then we
start the list tomorrow!

151
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,416
Does anyone know if there's a
bon festival happening anywhere?

152
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,583
Or a place where we
can see fireworks?

153
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,458
[KOIZUMI]
I can check around for those.

154
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,375
Don't forget about
the goldfish scooping!

155
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,375
[MIKURU laughs nervously]

156
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,375
[KOIZUMI]
I'll get right on it.

157
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,750
[KYON]
Stuck with the bill again.

158
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,333
Well, that's it for today!
See ya!

159
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,458
[KOIZUMI]
I'm off, too.

160
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,208
[MIKURU]
I'll see you later.

161
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,250
[KYON]
Nagato!

162
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,416
Uh... It's nothing important
or anything...

163
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,041
So how've you been?

164
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,708
Is everything okay?

165
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,833
It is.

166
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,916
That's good to hear.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,333
Yes.

168
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:42,041
Uh... Well, guess that's it.

169
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,416
Sorry to keep you.

170
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,583
Goodbye!

171
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,458
[KYON]
What was that?

172
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,625
Why'd I want to talk to her?

173
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,125
[phone rings]

174
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,833
[KYON] The next morning, I was
wakened from my peaceful slumber

175
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,958
by a call from Haruhi.

176
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,083
She said they'd found
a bon festival.

177
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,375
It was happening tonight
at a park somewhere.

178
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,291
You're late again, Kyon!
Seriously!

179
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,500
What's with you?

180
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:16,333
Anyway, we're buying yukatas,
and you're coming with us!

181
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,208
[KYON] So, we went
to a clothing outlet,

182
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,708
and Haruhi picked out yukatas
for Miss Asahina and Nagato.

183
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:26,250
Then, she marched them straight
into the changing rooms.

184
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,458
And... after making us wait
about an hour or so,

185
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,333
the three of them
finally appeared.

186
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,083
[HARUHI]
What d'ya think?

187
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,166
[gasps]

188
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,125
We look pretty hot, don't we?

189
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,416
Yes, the three of you look
wonderful in them.

190
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,791
Of course we do!

191
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,708
I picked all of 'em out myself,
especially Mikuru's!

192
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,375
Just look at you, you look
so darn cute in that!

193
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm like a fashion genius!

194
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,916
[MIKURU whimpers]

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,416
[KYON] Miss Asahina,
please spin around. Spin!

196
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,333
Wow!

197
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,083
This is amazing!

198
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,666
Yeah, this place
looks super fun!

199
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,541
[KYON]
A bon festival, huh?

200
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,333
Yeah... I guess it
figures it'd be so...

201
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,833
...crowded.

202
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,958
[gasps]

203
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,958
[KYON] Whoa, there's that
weird feeling again.

204
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,541
--[HARUHI] Look, Mikuru!
--[KYON gasps]

205
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,166
Over there! They've got goldfish
scooping, just like you wanted!

206
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,875
Come on, I bet you're
gonna catch a ton!

207
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,916
Do you wanna go scoop
some fish, too?

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,875
We could have a little contest.

209
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,750
I think I'll pass.

210
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,916
How 'bout you, Nagato?
Wanna get some food?

211
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,583
Huh?

212
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,916
What's up, Nagato?

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,500
Don't tell me you're actually
into that stuff.

214
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,166
I got it.

215
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,583
No.

216
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,500
[NAGATO]
That one.

217
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,666
It's yours for 800 yen!

218
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,166
[KYON] I wish she would've
let me buy that for her...

219
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,250
It's the least I could do after
all she's done for us.

220
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,625
[HARUHI]
I caught thirteen!

221
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,875
But I only kept one

222
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,833
'cause I don't have any
place to put 'em all.

223
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,000
Wow, that's an amazing haul!

224
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,541
Go ahead and have one,
but only one!

225
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,416
Okay, thanks.

226
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,041
Huh? Yuki, what's with the mask?

227
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,291
I bought it.

228
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,833
Oh... Okay.

229
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,208
Anyway, let's go shoot
off some fireworks!

230
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,916
It's the perfect way
to end the day!

231
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,208
[KYON] It was summer,
and summer vacation.

232
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,416
And I guess that's why I
wanted to forget about it.

233
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,583
But the truth was, I couldn't
ignore it any longer.

234
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,541
[HARUHI] Cool. Tomorrow, we're
gonna go catch some bugs.

235
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,916
Hey, Haruhi, I don't
want to spoil your fun,

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,208
but have you finished
your homework yet?

237
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,916
You gotta be kidding.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,416
That stuff's totally easy.

239
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
You can finish it
in like three days.

240
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,666
Three days?!

241
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,291
You have to get rid
of that junk first,

242
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,416
so you can spend the
rest of your summer

243
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,958
having fun and not
worrying about it!

244
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,500
It's the only way to get the
most out of your vacation!

245
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,666
[KYON groans] Why does
she have to be so smart?

246
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,500
The folks upstairs
weren't terribly fair

247
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,125
when they were divvying
up the stats for us.

248
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,291
Anyway, tomorrow we're
gonna go catch some bugs!

249
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:04,208
And the prize for whoever
catches the most is gonna be...

250
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,083
Yeah, I know. [gigggles]

251
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,416
Whoever catches the most gets
to be brigade leader for a day!

252
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,291
[KYON]
Ew.

253
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,916
That sounds like a lot of fun!

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,416
Are we allowed to catch
just any random bug?

255
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,041
Oh! Um... [laughs]

256
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,041
No, only cicadas! Yeah!

257
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:23,166
I'm calling it the SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest!

258
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,208
[KYON] The next day was
beautiful, sunny, and bright.

259
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,208
In fact, it was the
perfect day for us

260
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,875
to have our SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest.

261
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,000
And even though everyone
caught bugs the best way

262
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,875
they knew how, the winner of
the contest ended up being...

263
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,250
You guessed it, Haruhi.

264
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,000
It's important to
follow the spirit of

265
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,875
catch and release
with these guys.

266
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,791
I mean, if we let
'em go this time,

267
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,291
they might come back and
return the favor some day!

268
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,833
[KYON] What could
a cicada do for me,

269
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,583
even if it did come back?

270
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,708
[HARUHI]
Hurry! Go back to the mountains!

271
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,125
[cicadas chirping]

272
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,458
[KYON]
I sorta feel like Pandora,

273
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,583
when she opened her box.

274
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,125
[MIKURU]
Welcome to our store!

275
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,375
[KYON]
We met the next day,

276
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,708
even though we had no
idea what was going on.

277
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,791
Then, we were forced
to wear frog costumes

278
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,250
and hand balloons out in front
of the local supermarket.

279
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,708
[MIKURU gasps]

280
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,541
Awesome job today, guys!

281
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,333
[KYON] What's with
the special treatment?!

282
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,791
You're the best!

283
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,833
And the manager's super grateful
for all the hard work.

284
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:25,416
[KYON] Who cares how grateful
he is? What about our pay?

285
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,375
That's it!

286
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,708
Huh?

287
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,208
[HARUHI] I've had my eye on that
little guy for a long time now.

288
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,666
The manager said
we could have it

289
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,333
'cause Mikuru looks
so cute in it!

290
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,458
[KYON]
We worked in the sun,

291
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,458
sweat pouring down
our foreheads...

292
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,916
...for that?!

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,250
[HARUHI] We'll keep him in
the club room as a souvenir.

294
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,041
And Mikuru, you can wear him
whenever you want.

295
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,541
Just help yourself!

296
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,458
You have my permission!

297
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,958
Uh...

298
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,583
[sighs]

299
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,500
[KYON] And later that night, my
peace slumber was interrupted...

300
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,791
...by a phone call.

301
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,416
--[phone rings]
--Huh?

302
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,875

[MIKURU whimpers]

304
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,250
[gasps]

305
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,000
[MIKURU]
Kyon...

306
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,875
Miss Asahina?

307
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,083
[MIKURU]
Yes... It's me...

308
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,208
[sobbing] Something...
really bad...

309
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:27,208
I don't know...
W-W-What do I do...

310
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,125
Uh...

311
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:28,958
--[KOIZUMI] Hello!
--[gasps]

312
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,041
[KOIZUMI]
It's Koizumi.

313
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,333
What are you doing
with Miss Asahina

314
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,375
in the middle of the night?!

315
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,625
[KOIZUMI]
We have a situation over here.

316
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,250
Do you think you could
come meet us right away?

317
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,541
Abso-freaking-lutely.

318
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,583
[MIKURU sobbing]

319
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,875
[KYON]
Miss Asahina! What happened?

320
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,916
What's wrong?

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,083
Oh, Kyon... I... I can't...

322
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:55,333
I can't go back to
the future anymore!

323
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,708
Huh?

324
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,125
I'll explain it the best I can.

325
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,750
We're stuck in a time loop that,

326
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,041
as far as I can tell,
has no end.

327
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,000
[KYON] It's hard to believe
you're actually serious

328
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,416
with you sitting there,
smiling like that.

329
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,375
I mean, come on, do you have any
idea what you just said? Huh?

330
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:18,000
Of course, I do. Much more
than I want to, believe me.

331
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,791
I was having a little chat
with Miss Asahina earlier.

332
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,583
[KYON] Next time, call me!
And you stay home!

333
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,166
[KOIZUMI] And that was when the
two of us came to the conclusion

334
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,625
that something
seemed a little off

335
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,625
about the current flow of time.

336
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,625
Well, actually, it was Miss
Asahina who discovered it.

337
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,708
And thanks to her,
my suspicions were confirmed.

338
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:36,958
[KYON]
What suspicions?

339
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,416
[KOIZUMI]
That we're stuck in a time loop.

340
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,666
We're re-living the same period
of time, over and over again.

341
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,375
[KYON]
I know; you already said that.

342
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,500
[KOIZUMI] We're bein' forced
to repeat every day between

343
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,125
August the 17th
through the 31st.

344
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,666
In other words, we're in the
middle of what seems to be

345
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,208
an endless summer vacation.

346
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,875
[KYON] Well, at least it's
summer vacation, right?

347
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,083
[KOIZUMI] It's a never-ending,
endless summer vacation.

348
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,875
In other words, in this world,

349
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,833
the future doesn't
exist anymore.

350
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,583
All time stops at
September the 1st.

351
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,916
Seriously, who's
gonna believe that?

352
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,458
Well, for starters, we were sort
of hoping you would believe it.

353
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,208
What about the closed spaces you
were talking about before?

354
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,500
Could it be that we're trapped
inside one of those things?

355
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,583
Mh-hm. This isn't
the same thing.

356
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,708
A specific section of time
has been torn away.

357
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,375
At exactly midnight on August
the 31st, everything resets.

358
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,958
And then time reverts
straight back to

359
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,833
the morning of August the 17th.

360
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,583
That's the process.

361
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,375
[KYON]
What about our--

362
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,166
Wait, what about the
whole world's memories?

363
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,166
[KOIZUMI]
Their memory is reset.

364
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,666
Everyone's memory starts
over from the beginning.

365
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,625
Perfect, it's another
problem involving time.

366
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,625
Although, I guess I
shouldn't be surprised,

367
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,083
especially if there's
a time traveler around.

368
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,416
Oh, no, Miss Asahina
didn't have anything

369
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,916
to do with what's happening.

370
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,083
Okay then, what's causing it?

371
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,083
Miss Suzumiya is.

372
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,166
[sighs]

373
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,333
Oh, I'm sure she doesn't
even realize it.

374
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,666
But somewhere inside
her subconscious,

375
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,791
there's a desire to have summer
vacation last forever.

376
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,041
What the heck?!

377
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,500
You mean she still
hasn't had enough fun?

378
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,291
That's what I think anyway.

379
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,791
Or it's possible, she feels
there's something else

380
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,750
that needs to happen before
summer vacation can end.

381
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,083
[KYON] Oh, man...
The trouble she gets us into

382
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,625
is always galactic in scale.

383
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,666
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

384
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,708
If I knew that, we'd have this
problem solved by now.

385
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,291
You seem like you're enjoying
this an awful lot.

386
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,958
What's up with that?

387
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,250
Please don't take that the
wrong way, it's nothing.

388
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,833
However, this explains
the feelings of déjà vu

389
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,000
I've been having.

390
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,833
And the ones you've
been having as well.

391
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,625
And now that I think about it,

392
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,208
those feelings were probably
the residue of our memories

393
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,791
from all the instances
where time was reset.

394
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,208
Are we the only ones?

395
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,166
Or can other people feel
this happening, too?

396
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,708
It doesn't seem that way.

397
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,750
But then again, you and I
are exceptions to the rule.

398
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,458
But what about Haruhi?

399
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,125
Does she even realize what's
been going on around here?

400
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,916
No, I don't think she
knows it's happening.

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Besides, it would be very bad
for us if she did know about it.

402
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,833
However, there's someone
who doesn't seem

403
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,458
to be affected by the time loop
or these feelings of déjà vu.

404
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,833
As a matter of fact,

405
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,000
this person remembers
everything that's happened.

406
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,375
Are you gonna tell me
who it is or what?

407
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,666
I think you already
know who it is.

408
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,750
Well, is that true?

409
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,500
It is.

410
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,333
You can remember everything?

411
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,625
I can.

412
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,041
You wouldn't know how many times

413
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,500
we've been repeating the
past two weeks, would you?

414
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:39,541
This would be 15,527
times so far.

415
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,000
[KYON] Fifteen thousand
five-hundred twenty-seven?

416
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:46,166
What do you mean 15,527?

417
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,458
Nagato, what are you saying?

418
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,625
You're being totally
serious, aren't you?

419
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,625
I am.

420
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,125
You've gotta be kidding me!

421
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,750
We've been doing the
exact same things,

422
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,833
that many times,
every single time?

423
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,708
[NAGATO]
Not necessarily.

424
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:04,125
Throughout 15,527 repetitions,
we did not attend

425
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:10,041
a bon festival the 2,391st
time and the 11,054th time.

426
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,333
We went to a bon festival
but did not go to

427
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,791
a goldfish scooping
booth 437 times.

428
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,708
We've had part-time
jobs 9,052 times

429
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,250
and performed six
different types of jobs.

430
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,916
In addition to handing
out balloons,

431
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,458
we worked as movers--

432
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,375
[KYON]
Yeah... Got it...

433
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,666
[KOIZUMI]
Bye.

434
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,208
[sighs]

435
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,500
[KYON]
Fifteen thousand

436
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,625
five-hundred
twenty-seven times...

437
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,291
That's what she said.

438
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:50,041
Times two weeks... That's, uh...
about... 595 years!

439
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,458
And she's the only one who
remembers everything we've done.

440
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:57,458
She's had to repeat those same
things, over and over again.

441
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,000
Nagato...

442
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,333
What's it like to re-live the
same things that many times?

443
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,541
[KYON] The next night,
we went stargazing.

444
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,958
We were on the balcony
of Nagato's apartment.

445
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,166
And Koizumi brought
the telescope.

446
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,958
[chuckles]

447
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,041
[HARUHI]
I wonder if they're real.

448
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,125
What do you mean?

449
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,166
[HARUHI]
Martians.

450
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,125
[KYON]
I kinda hope they aren't.

451
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,875
[HARUHI] Whenever us humans
get around to landing on Mars,

452
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,333
I'm sure the Martians'll pop out
from wherever they're hiding

453
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:29,250
and say, "Welcome to Mars!"
or somethin' like that.

454
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,625
Oh... This is boring!

455
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,625
I know! I'm gonna
look for UFOs now!

456
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,083
[KYON] I wish I knew what
else she wants to do.

457
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,333
That's the big question, isn't
it?

458
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,750
If we knew the answer,

459
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:48,458
we'd be well on our way
to solving this thing.

460
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,833
I have an idea we
can try if you want.

461
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,958
What if someone were to suddenly
grab Miss Suzumiya from behind,

462
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,250
and then whispered, "I love
you," right into her ear?

463
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,125
And who's gonna be doing this?!

464
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:03,791
Can you think of anyone better
suited to play that role?

465
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:07,958
I'm supposed to tell her I
l-l-lo-- Aw, forget it.

466
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,125
All right then,
how 'bout if I do it?

467
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,416
[chuckles]

468
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,041
I'm just kidding.

469
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,791
I don't think I could pull
that role off anyway.

470
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,333
Besides, it would just
confuse Miss Suzumiya,

471
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,708
and we wouldn't want that.

472
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,666
[KOIZUMI laughs]

473
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,916
[KYON] So, anyway, the next day,
we went to the batting cages.

474
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,375
[KYON]
Hey, Nagato...

475
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,041
You knew about
this time loop thing

476
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,541
way before Miss Asahina,
didn't you?

477
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,875
[NAGATO]
Yes.

478
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:40,041
Then how come you didn't
say anything about it?

479
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,750
My function is to observe only.

480
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,541
[gasps]

481
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,166
Understood...

482
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,583
[KYON]
We chugged along,

483
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,875
doing all kinds of
summer vacation things.

484
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,041
More fireworks,
goby fishing tournament,

485
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,708
the test of courage,
movie-watching, beach-going...

486
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,750
Heck. We kept going,
and going, and going!

487
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,791
And the whole time,
all I could think was that

488
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,291
none of it was gonna
be enough for Haruhi.

489
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,833
But what could I do about it?

490
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,250
Nothing.

491
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:15,458
So, we ended up, like we always
did, at August the 30th.

492
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,916
[HARUHI sighs]

493
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,625
[HARUHI] That's it, we've
done everything on our list.

494
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,916
Hmm... But now I'm wondering
if we really did enough.

495
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,041
Hmm... Oh, well. Yeah,
I guess we did a lot.

496
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,625
Unless there's something
else you guys wanna do?

497
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,625
Okay, then...

498
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,125
We pretty much did everything
we set out to do this summer,

499
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,625
so I guess that's good enough.

500
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,208
[KYON]
No, it's not.

501
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,125
You're still not satisfied.

502
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,500
Well, that's it.
We're done for today!

503
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,625
I set tomorrow aside
just in case,

504
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:54,333
but I guess you can all
take the day off now.

505
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,791
Kay then, see you guys at
the club room on Monday!

506
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,708
[KYON]
Wait, Haruhi.

507
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,666
Well, that's it.
We're done for today!

508
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,916
I set tomorrow aside
just in case,

509
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,291
but I guess you can
all take the day off now.

510
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,375
[KYON gasps]

511
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,541
[KYON]
There's that feeling again...

512
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,416
And it's stronger
than all the others.

513
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,291
I can't let Haruhi leave.

514
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,916
If I let her walk out that door,

515
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,875
we'll end up re-living
the past two weeks

516
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:21,583
again and again for a
thousand more times!

517
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,291
[KYON]
But what should I do?

518
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,666
There must've been a clue
in something Haruhi said.

519
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,500
But what was it?

520
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,083
What's she been saying
all this time?

521
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't know...

522
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,541
I can't... remember...

523
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:44,541
[KYON]
It's August the 31st.

524
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,833
I haven't done my homework.

525
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,166
Whatever... It doesn't matter.

526
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,000
There's no point in doing it.

527
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,083
I mean, we're just gonna keep

528
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:55,708
re-living the last
couple of weeks.

529
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,500
Whatever happens next,
whether tomorrow comes or not,

530
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,916
a different version of me
will have to deal with it.
