00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,125
[COMMENTATOR]
The scores are pretty far apart,

2
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,458
but if Kumabara
can hold 'em,

3
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,916
they've got a chance.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,208
The bleachers behind third
are going nuts out there!

5
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,708
Suzuki on the mound...

6
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,875
[KYON]
Something's... wrong.

7
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,791
That's what it felt like anyway.

8
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,958
I didn't care about the
baseball game on TV

9
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,125
'cause it was between
some other schools.

10
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,666
For some reason,
I got into anyway,

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,125
and started rooting
for the losing team.

12
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:59,250
[KYON] And that's when I got the
feeling Haruhi was gonna call.

13
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,791
[phone rings]

14
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,041
What does she want?

15
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,125
Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

16
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,791
I know; you don't
have to tell me.

17
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,708
[HARUHI]
Hey, you're free, right? Good.

18
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:13,291
Meet us at 2:00 in front of
the station. And don't be late!

19
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,541
[dial tone]

20
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,666
[KYON] I didn't have a
chance to say anything.

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,500
[phone rings]

22
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,416
[KYON]
Now, what?

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,916
[HARUHI]
I forgot to tell you,

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,708
make sure to bring your swim
trunks and some money, too.

25
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,500
Oh, wait, and your bike.
Definitely bring your bike.

26
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,875
That's it. Over and out!

27
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,875
[dial tone]

28
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,375
[KYON]
Well, that was weird.

29
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,250
It was like I knew what
Haruhi was gonna say

30
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,291
--before she even said anything.
--[metal clink]

31
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,250
[COMMENTATOR]
What a shot!

32
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,375
It's a big, fat hit...

33
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,750
[KYON]
Yeah... No...

34
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,291
Actually, it felt
like we'd had that

35
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:45,375
exact same conversation before,
like déjà vu or something.

36
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,291
[COMMENTATOR] Chalk up
another run for Jyonan.

37
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,416
That makes eight runs this game.

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,291
[KYON]
Summer's almost over...

39
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,375
You're late again, Kyon!

40
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,166
Where's your motivation, huh?

41
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,416
Yeah, yeah.

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,333
You're the only reason
I showed up anyway.

43
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,291
[MIKURU giggles]
Thanks, that's really sweet.

44
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,541
Now that we're all present and
accounted for, we can get going!

45
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,958
Where to?

46
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,625
[HARUHI] To the public swimming
pool. Where do ya think?

47
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,250
[KYON] That figures...
considering the stuff I brought.

48
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,625
We've got lots of summer
vacation-y things to do

49
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,833
during our summer break!

50
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,458
But we've only so
much time because

51
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,625
once it's gone,
it's gone for good!

52
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,958
We have to do what
we can, while we can

53
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,750
during our one and only
summer as tenth graders!

54
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,625
It's up to Kyon and Koizumi
to get us to the pool.

55
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,375
I know I'm gonna
hate asking this,

56
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,208
but what did you
mean by that last thing?

57
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,500
You guys are taking
us there on your bikes!

58
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,583
[sighs]

59
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,625
[HARUHI inhales]
Mm, can you smell the chlorine?

60
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,833
That really makes
it feel like summer!

61
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,166
[laughs]
Woo-hoo!

62
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,750
[KYON]
Restrain thyself!

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,958
Canst thou not see
the "no diving" signs?

64
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,875
[gasps]
Hurry up and get in, guys!

65
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,125
The water's warm! It's perfect!

66
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,666
[MIKURU]
Huh?

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,375
--[MIKURU whimpers]
--[HARUHI laughs]

68
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,625
[BOTH scream]

69
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,875
Doesn't that look like fun?

70
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,916
I mean, seeing Miss
Suzumiya enjoy the day

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,416
in such a normal fashion.

72
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,291
It's rather charming,
don't you think?

73
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,500
First, she called me up
and told me what to bring,

74
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,083
And then,
she demanded I meet her

75
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,958
without telling me
what was going on.

76
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,541
I'm sorry, but I don't
see anything charming

77
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,208
or normal about that.

78
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,791
[KOIZUMI]
Well, when she gets an idea,

79
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,208
she tends to strike
while the iron's hot.

80
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,208
[KYON] Yeah, but every time she
strikes, something goes wrong.

81
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,958
And by wrong, I might
nightmarishly wrong.

82
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,291
You have a point,

83
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,291
but it's peaceful
enough around here.

84
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,125
And as long as Miss Suzumiya's
laughing and having a good time,

85
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,833
we don't have to worry about
any earth-shattering events.

86
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:24,875
[gasps]

87
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,333
Now what is it?

88
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,750
It's nothing...

89
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,666
Just my imagination, I guess.

90
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,458
With everything that's
happened since we met,

91
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,791
you could say I've
become slightly paranoid.

92
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,833
[KYON]
Hpmh.

93
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,375
[gasps]

94
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,291
Let's race one more time!

95
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,958
--It's like--
--[MIKURU yelps]

96
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,000
[MIKURU]
Huh?

97
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,708
[KYON]
Yum! It's strawberry-licious!

98
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,791
[HARUHI laughss]

99
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,291
[GROUP laughing]

100
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,375
[HARUHI]
Get it!

101
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,833
[KYON]
Geez...

102
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,625
Now I know why they call it
a "public" swimming pool.

103
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,166
Seems like everyone
in town's here today.

104
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,625
I wonder why Haruhi
chose this place.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,958
[KYON]
Hm?

106
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,958
[KYON] There's that
weird feeling again.

107
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,666
It's like I've seen
this happen before.

108
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,416
Nagato, sitting there...
all alone, looking bored.

109
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,291
--[HARUHI] Kyon!
--[KYON gasps]

110
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:42,291
[KYON] Yeah... And then
Haruhi shows up and says...

111
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,666
[KYON, HARUHI] "So, these two
guys are my brigade members.

112
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,750
They do what I say,

113
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,833
so if you want
something, ask them!"

114
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:48,833
[CHILDREN]
Okay!

115
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,041
[HARUHI]
Time for some fun!

116
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,625
Let's go play water soccer!

117
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,541
Yeah, sure...

118
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,583
[KYON] Oh, well.
Sometimes déjà vu's happen.

119
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,125
[HARUHI] I've been thinking
of some fun things to do,

120
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,125
so I came up with this.

121
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,541
What is that thing for?

122
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,041
[HARUHI] It's a schedule
of how we're gonna

123
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,291
spend the rest of
our summer vacation!

124
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,750
[KYON]
A schedule for who?

125
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,208
For us, that's who!

126
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,791
We've only got two
weeks of vacation left.

127
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,791
That fact alone blew me away.

128
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,916
We've done a lot of cool things,
but we're running outta time.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,791
There's still a bajillion
more things left for us to do.

130
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,625
I say, we gotta
pick up the pace!

131
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,458
[KYON]
Two weeks to do all that?!

132
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,625
[HARUHI] Mikuru, is there
anything else you wanna do?

133
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,833
[MIKURU]
Um...

134
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,166
I think I'd like to
try goldfish scooping.

135
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,333
[HARUHI]
Okay!

136
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,416
Goldfish scooping, it is.

137
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,208
[KOIZUMI]
Could I see that?

138
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,708
Okay, thanks.

139
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,583
We'll start the list tomorrow!

140
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,625
Do you guys know if there's a
bon festival happening anywhere?

141
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,666
Or a place to see fireworks?

142
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,083
[KYON] Why don't you
find that stuff yourself?

143
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,041
I can check around for those.

144
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,708
I'll call you if
I find anything.

145
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,500
[HARUHI]
Perfect!

146
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,375
I'll leave it up to you!

147
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,708
[HARUHI]
That's it for today! See ya!

148
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,750
Hey, Nagato?

149
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,625
Uh, well... It's nothing
important or anything,

150
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,916
but I was just wondering...
Is everything okay?

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,333
[NAGATO]
It is.

152
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,916
That's good to hear.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,958
[NAGATO]
Yes.

154
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,500
Okay...

155
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,541
[KYON]
That's it. You can go.

156
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,416
Sorry to keep you.

157
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,541
[KYON]
What was that?

158
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,416
Why'd I want to talk to her?

159
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,666
[KYON] And just like that,
Koizumi managed to find

160
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,541
a bon festival happening
the very next day.

161
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,000
Wow!

162
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:59,041
So this is what festivals
were like back in this time.

163
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,083
[KYON] I guess I shouldn't
be surprised it's so crowded.

164
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,291
[HARUHI]
Look, Mikuru!

165
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,000
They've got goldfish
scooping over there,

166
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,208
just like you wanted!

167
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,250
Let's catch a ton and
break some scoopers!

168
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,125
[KYON]
Don't break the scoopers.

169
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,458
I didn't know you were
into stuff like that.

170
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:24,958
I got it.

171
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,125
No.

172
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,000
[NAGATO]
That one.

173
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,291
Okay, it's yours for 800 yen!

174
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,250
[VENDOR]
Thanks!

175
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,708
[KYON] I wish she would've
let me buy that for her...

176
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,208
It's the least I could do
after all she's done for us.

177
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,500
[HARUHI]
What an unbelievable haul!

178
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,208
But, I don't have room
for all those fish,

179
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,041
so I just kept two for us!

180
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,333
Anyway, let's go shoot
off some fireworks!

181
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,041
It's the perfect way
to end the day!

182
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,208
[KYON] Come on!
Don't you ever get tired?

183
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,958
Oh, well. If anything,
Haruhi's endless energy

184
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,541
is one her better qualities.

185
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,916
[HARUHI laughing]

186
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,625
[KYON yells]

187
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,416
[KYON]
Reckless as always.

188
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,916
It was summer,
and summer vacation.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,208
And I guess that's why I
wanted to forget about it.

190
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,875
Truth was, I couldn't
ignore it any longer.

191
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,291
Tomorrow, we're gonna
catch some bugs.

192
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,875
[KYON]
I don't want to spoil your fun,

193
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,791
but have you finished
your homework yet?

194
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,541
You gotta be kidding.
That stuff's totally easy.

195
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,333
You can finish it
in like three days.

196
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,666
Three days?!

197
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,958
[HARUHI] You have to
get rid of that junk first,

198
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,666
so you can spend the
rest of your summer

199
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,416
having fun and not
worrying about it!

200
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,291
That's the only way to get
the most out of your vacation!

201
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,541
[KYON] Why does she
have to be so smart?

202
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,416
The folks upstairs
weren't terribly fair

203
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,875
when they were divvying
up the stats for us.

204
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,750
So anyway, tomorrow we're
gonna go bug-catching!

205
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,750
And the prize for catching
the most bugs is gonna be...

206
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:51,833
Um... He, he, the winner gets
to be brigade leader for a day!

207
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,750
[KYON] That's the last
thing I'd wanna be!

208
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,125
That sounds like a lot of fun,

209
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,250
but can we catch just
any random bug?

210
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,791
No... Only cicadas!

211
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,000
That's it, I'm calling it

212
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,791
the SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest!

213
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,375
[KYON sighs]

214
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,750
[KYON] The next day was another
beautiful day, sunny and bright.

215
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,958
And the winner of the
contest ended up being...

216
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,166
You guessed it, Haruhi.

217
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,791
It's important to
follow the spirit of

218
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,333
catch and release
with these guys.

219
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,958
I mean, if we let
'em go this time,

220
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,083
they might come back
and return the favor!

221
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,666
[KYON] If something
were to come back and

222
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,458
return the favor of being
randomly captured and released,

223
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,333
I'd say they'd have to
be as dumb as a bug.

224
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,750
Hurry! Go back to the mountains!

225
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:35,791
[cicadas chirping]

226
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,958
[KYON gasps]

227
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,625
[MIKURU]
Wel-Welcome to our store!

228
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,166
[KYON] The next day,
our fearless leader

229
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,625
got us some part-time jobs.

230
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,083
[KOIZUMI]
Would you like a balloon?

231
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:50,958
No?

232
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:51,708
[NAGATO]
Take it.

233
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,541
Gimme!

234
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,833
[KYON]
Sure...

235
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,250
Thank you!

236
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,083
[KYON] Wearing a costume
in heat like this isn't a job.

237
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,375
It's more like a
test of endurance.

238
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,833
[BOTH]
Huh?

239
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,916
Like I said, our pay is the
costume Mikuru's wearing.

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,083
I've had my eye on this little
guy for a long time now.

241
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,041
The manager gave it to us 'cause
Mikuru looks so cute in it!

242
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,041
[KYON]
We worked in the sun,

243
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,750
sweat pouring down
our foreheads...

244
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,166
...for that?!

245
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,333
We'll keep this froggy in the
club room as a souvenir.

246
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,583
And Mikuru, you can wear him
whenever you want to, okay?

247
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,375
You have my permission!

248
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,416
[KYON gasps, grunts]

249
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,458
[sighs]

250
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:35,458
[phone rings]

251
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,625
[KYON grumbling]

252
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,583
[KYON]
Dammit...

253
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,583
Hello?

254
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,958
[MIKURU whimpers]

255
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,500
[KYON yells]

256
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,125
[MIKURU]
Kyon...

257
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,250
Miss Asahina, is that you?

258
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,708
[MIKURU sobbing]
Yes... It's me...

259
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,083
Something... really bad...

260
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,625
...don't know...

261
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,166
Is this really Miss Asahina?

262
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,041
[KOIZUMI]
Oh, hello! It's Koizumi.

263
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,208
How about you tell me

264
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,625
what you're doing
with her at this hour?!

265
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,666
[KOIZUMI]
We have a bit of situation here.

266
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,666
And it's a pretty
dire one, at that.

267
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,708
You could even say
it's an emergency.

268
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,875
[tires screeching]

269
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,708
Sorry we had to
call you out so late.

270
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,291
[KYON]
Miss Asahina! What happened?

271
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,583
I'm gonna kill you, Koizumi!

272
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,875
Oh, Kyon...

273
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,000
[sniffle]

274
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,291
I-I can't go back to the future!

275
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,000
[sobs]

276
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,625
[MIKURU sobbing]

277
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,208
Because I have to
classified information,

278
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:38,666
I used classified information
to get in touch with the future.

279
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,291
I haven't gotten any classified
information for about a week.

280
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:47,125
And I started to think how
weird that was, and I...

281
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:52,500
I was so surprised, I classified
information, I really did.

282
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,916
But it was classified
information, too.

283
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,250
And now I don't know what to do!

284
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,125
[KYON] Are all the classified
information things

285
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,625
you're talking about,
stuff you can't say on TV?

286
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,583
[KOIZUMI]
I'll explain it the best I can.

287
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,708
We're stuck in a time loop
that seems to infinite.

288
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,958
[KYON]
Huh?!

289
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,333
[KOIZUMI] We're repeating
every day between

290
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,333
August the 17th
through the 31st.

291
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,583
You see, time doesn't exist
after September the 1st.

292
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,375
It's only natural Miss Asahina
can't go back to the future,

293
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,583
when there's no future to go to.

294
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,083
There's nothing natural
about not having a future.

295
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,000
I mean, who's gonna
believe such a thing?

296
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,750
Actually, we were sort of
hoping you would believe it.

297
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,083
[KYON] They say,
"Believe and you'll be saved,"

298
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,250
but I've yet to be saved
from anything, even once.

299
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,583
Well, what's causing this
to happen? Got any ideas?

300
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,750
Wait, you mean you
don't already know?

301
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,333
I don't want to, so there.

302
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,541
[KOIZUMI]
It's Miss Suzumiya.

303
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,958
[KYON chokes, sighs]

304
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,708
I'm sure she doesn't even
realize it's happening.

305
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,375
It's a result of her
subconscious desires.

306
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,791
She wants summer
vacation to last forever.

307
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,666
[KYON]
You're kidding!

308
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,000
She still hasn't had enough fun?

309
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,416
[KOIZUMI]
That's what I think.

310
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,416
Perhaps she feels there's
something else that needs

311
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,916
to happen before our summer
vacation can really be over.

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,166
[KYON] Oh, man...
The trouble she gets us into

313
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,333
is always galactic in scale.

314
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,041
Well, anyway, at least now
I have an explanation

315
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,875
for all those weird feelings
of déjà vu I've been having.

316
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,916
You too? Do you
think it's possible

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,166
other people are having
the same feelings?

318
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,625
I doubt it, but you
and I are different.

319
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,375
The only people who can sense
this strange thing happening

320
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,666
are the ones who are
closest to Miss Suzumiya.

321
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,958
However, there's someone
who doesn't seem

322
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,583
to be affected by these
feelings of déjà vu.

323
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,958
As a matter of fact,

324
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,291
this person remembers
everything that's happened.

325
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,666
Well, are you gonna tell
me who it is or what?

326
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,125
I think you already
know that, too.

327
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,000
Is that true?

328
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,041
It is.

329
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,666
You can remember everything?

330
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,875
I can.

331
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,625
Then, how many times has
this happened to us?

332
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,250
This would be
15,532 times so far.

333
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,291
[KYON gasps]

334
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,333
[KYON] Fifteen thousand
five-hundred thirty-two?

335
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,416
Nagato, I'm having a hard
time processing all this.

336
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,666
[gulps] But are you serious?

337
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,125
I am.

338
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,750
[KYON] You're saying we've
done the exact same things,

339
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,375
every time, that many times?

340
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,375
[NAGATO]
Not necessarily.

341
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:30,416
Throughout 15,532 repetitions,
we did not attend a bon festival

342
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,791
the 2,391st time and
the 11,054th time.

343
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,916
We went to a bon festival
but did not go to

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,500
a goldfish scooping
booth 437 times.

345
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,000
We obtained part-time
jobs 9,056 times

346
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,541
and performed six
different types of jobs.

347
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,750
In addition to handing
out balloons, we worked as

348
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,208
--movers, cashiers--
--[KYON] Stop!

349
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,083
Okay... I got it.

350
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,708
[KYON] Fifteen thousand
five-hundred thirty-two times...

351
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,666
That's what Nagato said.

352
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,333
Times two weeks...
That's, uh... 595 years!

353
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,333
She's the only one who
remembers everything we've done.

354
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,958
And she's had to repeat
those same things,

355
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,875
over and over again.

356
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,416
Nagato...

357
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,791
What's it like to re-live the
same things that many times?

358
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,708
[sighs]

359
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,000
[KYON] That's gotta be
the craziest story ever.

360
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,666
[KYON] The next night,
we went stargazing.

361
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,083
We were on the balcony
of Nagato's apartment.

362
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,000
And at first, Haruhi was
all over that telescope.

363
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,666
But eventually...

364
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,791
Oh, man. I wish I knew
what else she wants to do.

365
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,625
That's the question, isn't it?

366
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,875
If we knew the answer,

367
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,916
we'd be well on our way
to solving this thing.

368
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,541
I have an idea we
can try if you want.

369
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,250
What if someone were to grab
Miss Suzumiya from behind,

370
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,458
and then whispered, "I love
you," right into her ear?

371
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,041
[KYON]
And who's gonna be doing this?!

372
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,625
Can you think of anyone
better suited for that role?

373
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,500
[KYON]
My turn! I summon my veto card!

374
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,166
[KOIZUMI]
All right. How about if I do it?

375
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,375
[chuckles]

376
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,708
I'm just kidding.

377
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,125
I don't think I could pull
that role off anyway.

378
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,291
Besides, it would just
confuse Miss Suzumiya.

379
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,125
[KOIZUMI laughs]

380
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,166
[KYON]
Hmph.

381
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,750
[KYON]
We chugged along,

382
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,541
doing all kinds of
summer vacation things.

383
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,541
We went to a real
fireworks show,

384
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,375
and we even signed up for
a goby fishing tournament.

385
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,166
We did the test of courage,
watched some movies,

386
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,750
went to the beach,
bowling, even karaoke.

387
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,958
We were always doing something,
always on the move.

388
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,750
And the whole time,
all I could think was that

389
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,916
none of it was going to
be enough for Haruhi.

390
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,833
But, I couldn't do
anything about it.

391
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,541
So, I just bit my
lip and watched

392
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,083
as the last days of our
summer vacation went by.

393
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:13,541
And then, before I knew it,
August the 30th was here.

394
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,458
[HARUHI]
Hmm.

395
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,083
Well, that's it. We finished
everything on our list.

396
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,500
I know we did a lot, but now
I wonder if we did enough.

397
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:34,958
Hmm... Oh, well. Yeah,
I guess we did do a lot.

398
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,375
Unless there's something
else you guys wanna do?

399
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,625
[MIKURU whimpers]

400
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,416
[HARUHI]
Hmm.

401
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,791
Oh, okay then.

402
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,875
We pretty much did everything
we set out to do this summer,

403
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,625
so I guess that's enough.

404
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,416
[KYON]
No, it's not.

405
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,125
You're still not satisfied.

406
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,541
[gasps]

407
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,416
I guess that's it for today.

408
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,375
I set tomorrow
aside just in case,

409
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,500
but I guess you can
take the day off now.

410
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,833
I'll see you guys at the
club room on Monday!

411
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,791
[KYON]
Wait, Haruhi!

412
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,333
[Kyon gasps]

413
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,250
[KYON]
There's that feeling again!

414
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,583
And it's stronger
than all the others!

415
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,875
Now I know we've done this
ten thousand times before,

416
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,625
I can't let Haruhi leave.
If I let her walk out that door,

417
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,666
we'll end up re-living the past
two weeks again and again!

418
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,125
But, what should I do?

419
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,000
There must've been a clue
in something Haruhi said.

420
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,666
But what? What? What?!
Come on! Remember!

421
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,125
It's something
I'm worried about,

422
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,000
but I'm putting it
off for some reason.

423
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,250
If I don't do something now,
she'll go home!

424
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,833
I can't let that happen!
If I do, nothing will change!

425
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,791
Try to remember!
What've we done up till now?

426
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,750
What didn't we do?!

427
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,916
[growls]

428
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,333
There's no time to
think about it anymore.

429
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,083
It doesn't matter
if it doesn't work.

430
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,750
Just say something, anything!

431
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,833
[gasps]

432
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,500
[gasps] 

433
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,916
Hang on a second!

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,166
We're not done yet!

435
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,500
[HARUHI]
Huh?!

436
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,958
Homework! Homework!

437
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,500
What are you talking about?

438
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,250
None of my homework's done!
I haven't even started it yet!

439
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,375
My summer can't be over
until I finish it!

440
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,458
Are you nuts?

441
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,666
Koizumi! Did you
finish your homework?

442
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,708
No, uh, we were so busy,
I'm only half-way done with it.

443
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,125
Let's do it together!

444
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,583
You too, Nagato.
I bet you're not done yet.

445
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,500
And you're coming with us,
Miss Asahina.

446
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,375
Uh, where are we going?

447
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,291
We're all gonna
meet at my house!

448
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,166
Bring all your notebooks
and textbooks,

449
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,875
and we'll work on it together!

450
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,208
We'll finish our summer
activities once and for all!

451
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,125
Nagato, Koizumi, I need to
copy whatever you've got.

452
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,375
Roger that!

453
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,416
We're gonna start first
thing tomorrow morning.

454
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,708
And we're gonna go
all day until we finish!

455
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,250
[HARUHI]
Hold it right there!

456
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:10,666
[growls]

457
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,500
How dare you give the orders?!

458
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,916
I'm the brigade leader,
and as your superior,

459
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,125
you need to get my
permission first!

460
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,500
Who do you think you are, huh?!

461
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,583
Acting without my permission
is against the rules!

462
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,625
[KYON gasps]

463
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:27,750
[HARUHI growls]

464
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,208
I wanna come over, too!

465
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:45,041
[alarm beeps]

466
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,125
[KYON]
It looks like I hit the jackpot.

467
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:10,916
[KOIZUMI] Miss Suzumiya is
a smart and talented person.

468
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,583
She's always been that way,
and she always will be.

469
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,625
And that's probably why
it never occured to her

470
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,500
that summer homework
could also be a bit of a

471
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,000
pain for others.

472
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,416
[KOIZUMI]
Since she's never had to do

473
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,041
the study group thing before,

474
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,083
I can see how she'd overlook
an opportunity like that.

475
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,375
[KYON] It was the first
day of the new term.

476
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,666
I should have gone home by now,

477
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,041
but I ended up
coming here instead.

478
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,625
Koizumi showed up, too.
Probably for the same reason.

479
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:42,083
It was weird though.
Nagato wasn't there.

480
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,583
I couldn't tell
by looking at her,

481
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,500
but I'll bet she must've
been pretty exhausted.

482
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,750
[KYON] The thought of us
re-living the past two weeks

483
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:54,250
tens of thousands of times
seems like a bad dream.

484
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,541
I'm not at all surprised
you feel that way.

485
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,958
We don't share any memories
with the versions of us

486
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:04,875
who had to go through
15,531 time loops.

487
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:08,833
That's because on
the 15,532nd time,

488
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:12,166
we snapped back into
the normal time flow.

489
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,083
How about a game of poker?

490
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,833
[KYON]
Hm?

491
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:19,166
Yeah, sure. Why not? I don't
have any money though.

492
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,416
[KOIZUMI]
Then we'll play for fun.

493
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,583
[KYON]
I did get a lot of hints,

494
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,916
hints like those
feelings of déjà vu,

495
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,833
especially the last one.

496
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,208
I wonder if it could've
been a memory

497
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:32,875
sent by one of the
previous versions of us.

498
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:36,416
I'm here because of all the
us's, if that's even a word,

499
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,750
who had to repeat
those last two weeks.

500
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,541
That's the way I
have to think about it,

501
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,250
so that it wasn't
all for nothing.

502
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,166
If I did forget,
then I'd be like Haruhi,

503
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,625
who's unaware those
summers even happened.

504
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,583
[KYON]
Hm?

505
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,583
How many?

506
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:52,583
[KYON]
I'm good.

507
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,625
Then, so am I.

508
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:58,458
[KYON] If I had the chance
to live today all over again...

509
