1
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,416
[COMMENTATOR] At the time
of the seventh, the score's 7-0.

2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,250
Next batter up is Yamada.

3
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:49,166
[KYON] Something's wrong...
That's what it felt like anyway.

4
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,791
[KYON] I didn't care about
the baseball game on TV;

5
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,041
it was between schools
from another town.

6
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,083
But because I tend to
symphatize with underdogs,

7
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,708
I ended up rooting
for the losing team.

8
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,125
And it was right about then,

9
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,000
that I suddenly got the
feeling Haruhi was gonna call.

10
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,625
--[phone rings]
--[gasps]

11
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,250
What the heck does she want?

12
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,041
[KYON'S SISTER]
Hey, your phone's ringing, Kyon.

13
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,416
Yeah, I know that.
You don't have to tell me.

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,750
[phone ringing]

15
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:16,958
[COMMENTATOR]
The bleachers behind third

16
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,125
are going nuts out there.

17
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,708
[HARUHI]
Hey, you're free, right? Good.

18
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,708
[HARUHI] Meet us at 2:00
in front of the station.

19
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,791
And don't be late!

20
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,000
[dial tone]

21
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,041
[KYON sighs]

22
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,208
[KYON] I didn't even have
a chance to say anything.

23
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,958
[phone rings]

24
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,583
--[KYON] Yeah, what?
--[HARUHI] I forgot to tell you,

25
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,208
make sure and bring your swim
trunks and some money, too.

26
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,625
Oh, and your bike.
Definitely bring your bike.

27
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,916
That's it. Over and out!

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,208
--[dial tone]
--[KYON] Ugh.

29
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,833
Weird... It was like I knew

30
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:48,208
what Haruhi was gonna
say before she said it.

31
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,458
Yeah... No...

32
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,458
Actually, it felt like we'd had
the exact same conversation

33
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:58,125
once before. Kinda like
déjà vu or something.

34
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,041
[metal clink]

35
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,416
[COMMENTATOR]
Oh, what a shot!

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,541
It's a big, fat hit heading
straight for left field!

37
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,458
And it's over the fence!
And it's gone!

38
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,125
[KYON]
Summer's almost over...

39
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,375
You are late, Kyon!

40
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,125
Where's your motivation?

41
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,333
[KYON]
Yeah, yeah.

42
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,833
Sorry to keep you waiting.

43
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,208
Now that we're all present
and accounted for, we can go!

44
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,500
[KYON]
Where?

45
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,416
To the public swimming pool!
Where do ya think?

46
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,791
[KYON] That figures...
considering the stuff I brought.

47
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,791
[HARUHI] We've got lots of
summer vacation-y things

48
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,041
to do during our break!

49
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,750
But we've only so
much time because

50
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,958
once it's gone,
it's gone for good!

51
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,750
We'll do everything
we can, while we can

52
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,125
during our only summer
as tenth graders!

53
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,291
And for starters, we're gonna
ride the bikes to the pool!

54
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,250
[KYON] Did... everyone
ride bikes today?

55
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,458
No, the only bikes
we have to take

56
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,208
are the ones you and
I brought with us.

57
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,625
[KYON]
Huh?

58
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,208
[HARUHI] Kyon, you better
not let Koizumi beat you!

59
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,625
Come on! Full speed ahead!

60
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,416
[HARUHI] Well, here we are.
Hurry up and park the bikes!

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,041
We're trying to have fun,
Kyon, so stop acting tired!

62
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,666
[KYON]
And whose fault is that, huh?!

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,625
[HARUHI]
Aah, can you smell the chlorine?

64
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,625
That really makes
it feel like summer!

65
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,958
[KYON]
Crowded...

66
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,000
Here's the plan, you go
dump our stuff somewhere,

67
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,708
and then meet us in the pool.

68
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,958
We're gonna have a little race.
Come on, Mikuru, you and me!

69
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,500
[MIKURU screams]

70
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,541
[HARUHI gasps]
Hurry up and get in, guys!

71
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,375
The water's warm! It's perfect!

72
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,125
[KYON] Can't she see
the "no diving" signs?

73
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,791
They're everywhere!

74
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,625
[KOIZUMI chuckles]
Doesn't that look like fun?

75
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,833
It's such a peaceful
looking scene, isn't it?

76
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,125
And in a way, it makes me smile.

77
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,125
I mean, seeing Miss
Suzumiya enjoy the day

78
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,875
in a normal fashion.
It's a rather charming sight,

79
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,041
don't you think?

80
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,750
She called me,
told me what to bring,

81
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,291
and then ordered me to meet
her without telling me anything

82
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:14,208
about what was going on.
That isn't charming or normal.

83
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,958
Well, if you ask me,
none of that

84
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,041
is anything to make
such a fuss over.

85
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,208
And as long as Miss Suzumiya's
laughing and having a good time,

86
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,500
we don't have to worry about
any earth-shattering events

87
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,125
happening any time soon.

88
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,583
[KYON]
I hope you're right.

89
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:28,875
All right!

90
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,125
[gasps]

91
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,250
What?

92
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,083
Nothing. It's just
my imagination.

93
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,250
With everything that's
happened since we met,

94
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,291
you could say I've become
a little bit paranoid.

95
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,166
Here you go!

96
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,208
Oh, thanks for making the tea.

97
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,583
Oh, it's delicious!

98
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,666
[HARUHI] Come on,
let's go swim some more!

99
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,250
[MIKURU whimpers]

100
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,625
[KYON]
Geez...

101
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,875
Now I know why they call
it a "public" swimming pool.

102
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,416
Seems like everyone
in town's here today.

103
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,625
I wonder why Haruhi
chose this place.

104
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,666
Hm?

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,666
[KYON]
Huh?

106
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,625
There's that feeling again...

107
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,875
It's like I've seen
this happen before,

108
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,666
with Nagato sitting there
like that, looking bored.

109
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,500
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

110
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,666
[KYON] Yeah... And then
Haruhi shows up, and says...

111
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,541
These guys are my
brigade members.

112
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,666
They do what I say.

113
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,250
So if you want
something, ask them!

114
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,375
Time for some fun!

115
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,375
Let's play water soccer!

116
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,291
[KYON]
Uh. Yeah, sure...

117
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,041
[KYON] Oh, well.
Sometimes déjà vu's happen.

118
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,250
Get ready, Mikuru, surf's up!

119
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:47,916
[MIKURU yelps]

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,958
[gasps]

121
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,125
[MIKURU whimpering]

122
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:54,833
[HARUHI]
I've been thinking about

123
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,541
some fun things we could do.

124
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,875
[KYON]
What's that thing?

125
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,833
I came up with this
schedule of how we're gonna

126
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,791
spend the rest of
our summer vacation!

127
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,416
I realized something...

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,708
We've only got two more weeks
of summer vacation left to go!

129
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,791
That fact totally blew me away.

130
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,916
I know we've done a lot
of cool things so far,

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,583
but we've only so much time,

132
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,375
and there's a bajillion
more things left for us to do!

133
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,250
So, we're gonna
pick up the pace!

134
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,208
[KYON]
Two weeks to do all that?!

135
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,583
Mikuru, is there anything
else you wanna do?

136
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,750
[MIKURU]
Huh?

137
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,375
Uh... I'd like to try
goldfish scooping.

138
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,333
Okay!

139
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,875
Goldfish scooping, it is...

140
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,916
Could I see that for a moment?

141
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,958
[KOIZUMI chuckles]
Thank you.

142
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,416
Does anyone know if there's a
bon festival happening close by?

143
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,166
[KOIZUMI] Oh, I could
check around for one.

144
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,875
That'd be awesome.

145
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,208
Okay, tomorrow,
we start the list.

146
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,458
And I guess that's it for today.

147
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,791
[bike rattling]

148
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,041
[KYON]
Nagato!

149
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,791
Hey, it's nothing important
or anything, but...

150
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,125
I was just wondering...

151
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,250
Is everything okay with you?

152
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,708
It is.

153
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,750
Uh... Great,
that's good to hear.

154
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:15,791
Yes.

155
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,958
[KYON]
What the heck?

156
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,000
Why'd I want to talk to her?

157
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,666
I guess that's it.

158
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,041
[KYON] The next morning, I was
wakened from my peaceful slumber

159
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,916
by a call from Haruhi.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,458
She said they'd
found a bon festival.

161
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,458
We're all gonna go buy yukatas.

162
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,333
I guess Yuki doesn't have one,
and neither does Mikuru.

163
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,916
And I don't have one either,

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,666
but I know a place that sells
them in sets for really cheap.

165
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,416
[KYON] So, we went
to a clothing outlet,

166
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,750
and Haruhi picked out yukatas
for Miss Asahina and Nagato.

167
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,375
Then, she marched them straight
into the changing rooms.

168
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,750
After about an hour...

169
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,791
--...they emerged.
--[HARUHI] Ta-da!

170
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,416
[KYON]
Whoa! Blinding!

171
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,166
The three of you look
absolutely wonderful in them.

172
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,458
Well, of course we do!

173
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,500
I picked them out myself,
especially Mikuru's!

174
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,166
Look at you, you're so cute!

175
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,916
I'm a genius!

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,583
Oh? Uh, yeah!

177
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,625
[KYON]
Miss Asahina... Aah!

178
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,708
[MIKURU]
Wow!

179
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,125
[HARUHI giggles]

180
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,916
They've got goldfish scooping,
just like you wanted!

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,083
I bet you're gonna catch a ton!

182
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,958
[KYON]
A bon festival, huh?

183
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,208
It figures that
it'd be so crowded...

184
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,250
Huh?

185
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,000
[KYON] I haven't been to
a bon festival in a while,

186
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,625
but it feels like I
just went to one.

187
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,291
That tower... Those vendors...

188
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,000
[KOIZUMI]
Do you wanna go scoop some fish?

189
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,125
[KYON]
Hm?

190
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,166
We could have a little contest.

191
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,833
Leave it to the expert!

192
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,708
[KYON]
Mm, I'll pass.

193
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,833
How 'bout you, Nagato?
Do you wanna go get some food?

194
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,791
[KYON]
Hm?

195
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,291
Don't tell me you're
actually into this stuff.

196
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,958
I got it.

197
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,000
[NAGATO]
No.

198
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,541
[NAGATO]
That one.

199
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,333
[VENDOR]
It's yours for 800 yen!

200
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,708
[KYON] I wish she would've
let me buy that for her.

201
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,625
It's the least I could do
after all she's done for us.

202
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,875
[HARUHI]
What an unbelievable haul!

203
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,291
I caught thirteen!
But, I only kept one

204
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,500
'cause I don't have any
place to put all those fish.

205
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,750
I gave another one to Mikuru!

206
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,875
[HARUHI] Go ahead and
have one, but only one!

207
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,541
[KYON]
Okay, thanks.

208
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,708
Hey, Yuki, what's up with
the mask you got there?

209
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,166
I bought it.

210
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,083
Oh... Okay.

211
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,416
Anyway, let's go
shoot up fireworks!

212
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,666
We'll end the day
with a firework show!

213
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,791
[KYON]
Do you even understand

214
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,916
the meaning of the
word "moderation"?!

215
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,833
[KYON] It was summer,
and summer vacation.

216
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,666
And I guess that's why I
wanted to forget about it.

217
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,333
But the truth was, I couldn't
ignore it any longer.

218
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,750
[HARUHI]
Tomorrow, we're catchin' bugs.

219
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,875
Hey, Haruhi, I don't
want to spoil your fun,

220
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,208
but have you finished
your homework?

221
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,875
Are you kidding?
That stuff's easy.

222
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,875
You can finish it
in like three days.

223
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,166
Three days?!

224
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,666
[HARUHI] You have to get
rid of that junk first,

225
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,125
so you can spend the
rest of your summer

226
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,291
having fun and not
worrying about it!

227
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,916
It's the only way to get the
most out of your vacation!

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,250
[KYON] Why does she
have to be so smart?

229
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,958
The folks upstairs
weren't terribly fair

230
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,666
when they were divvying
up the stats for us.

231
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,458
Kay, listen up! We're gonna
go bug-catching tomorrow!

232
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,833
And whoever catches the
most bugs is gonna get...

233
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,583
Lemme see... I know!

234
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,958
They'll get to be brigade
leader for a whole day!

235
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:49,833
[KYON]
No thanks!

236
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,541
That sounds like a lot of fun!

237
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,791
But, can we catch
just any random bug?

238
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:58,041
Um... No, wait... Only cicadas!

239
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,250
That's it, I'm calling it

240
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,583
the SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest!

241
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,250
[KYON] The next day was
beautiful, sunny, and bright.

242
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,916
In fact, it was the
perfect day for us

243
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,291
to have our SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest.

244
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,041
And even though everyone caught
bugs the best way they knew how,

245
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,000
the winner of the
contest ended up being...

246
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,083
You guessed it, Haruhi.

247
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,791
It's important to
follow the spirit of

248
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,708
catch and release
with these guys.

249
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,500
I mean, if we let
'em go this time,

250
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,833
they might come back
and return the favor!

251
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,750
--[cicada's chirping]
--[GROUP gasps]

252
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,333
[KYON] What could
a cicada do for me,

253
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,875
even if it did come back?

254
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,750
I sorta feel like Pandora,
when she opened her box.

255
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,375
[MIKURU]
W-Welcome to our store!

256
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,875
[KYON]
We met the next day,

257
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,708
even though we had absolutely
no idea what was going on.

258
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:46,916
Our confusion continued

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,458
as we stood outside
the local supermarket,

260
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,083
wearing frog costumes
and handing out balloons.

261
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,125
Hey, it's a living.

262
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,250
[MIKURU whimpers]

263
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,458
[KYON] I feel like I just
escaped the Adzam's leader beam.

264
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,708
You guys did an awesome job!

265
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,000
[KYON] What's with
the special treatment?

266
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,250
You guys are the best!

267
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,041
The manager's super grateful
for all the hard work.

268
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,083
Who cares how grateful he is?
What about our pay?

269
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,708
That's it!

270
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,166
[KYON]
Huh?

271
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,208
I've had my eye on this little
guy for a long time now.

272
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,375
The manager gave it to us

273
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,750
'cause Mikuru looks
so darn cute in it!

274
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,750
[KYON]
We worked in the sun,

275
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,666
sweat pouring down
our foreheads...

276
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,916
...for that?!

277
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,958
We'll keep him in the
club room as a souvenir.

278
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,375
And Mikuru, you can wear
him whenever you want.

279
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,583
Help yourself!

280
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,666
You have my permission, 'kay?

281
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,125
[KYON]
Hm?

282
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,916
[sighs]

283
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,500
[KYON]
Later that night...

284
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:48,458
My peaceful slumber was
interrupted by a phone call.

285
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,541

Miss Asahina?

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,875
[MIKURU sobbing]
Yes... It's me...

290
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,833
Something... really bad...

291
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:01,791
What's wrong?

292
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,166
[KOIZUMI]
Hello, it's Koizumi.

293
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,458
What are you doing with
Miss Asahina at this hour?!

294
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,666
[KOIZUMI]
We have a situation here.

295
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,541
Is it possible for you to
come meet us right now?

296
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,583
[KYON] Miss Asahina! What
happened? Are you okay?

297
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,708
[MIKURU sobbing]

298
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,916
It's terrible... I can't...

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,041
I can't go back to
the future anymore!

300
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,916
[MIKURU sobbing]

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,375
I'll try to explain
it the best I can.

302
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,708
We're stuck in a time loop that,

303
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,416
as far as I can tell,
seems to have no end.

304
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,083
[sighs]

305
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,458
It's hard to believe
that you're serious

306
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,125
with you standing there,
smiling like that.

307
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,375
Come on.

308
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,291
Koizumi, do you have any
idea what you just said?

309
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:48,208
Of course, I do. Much more
than I want to, believe me.

310
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,291
In fact, I was having a word
with Miss Asahina earlier.

311
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,166
[KYON] Call me when
you have a word with her!

312
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,583
It's like this, we came
to the conclusion that

313
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,833
something seemed a little off
about the current flow of time.

314
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,125
Well, actually, it was Miss
Asahina who discovered it.

315
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,583
And thanks to her,
my suspicions were confirmed.

316
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,958
What suspicions?

317
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,291
That we've become
stuck in a time loop.

318
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,250
We're re-living the same period
of time, over and over again.

319
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,125
I know; you already said that.

320
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,166
We're being forced to
repeat every day between

321
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,166
August the 17th
through the 31st.

322
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,375
In other words, we're in the
middle of what seems to be

323
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,333
an endless summer vacation.

324
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,250
Well, at least it's
summer vacation, right?

325
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:29,416
It's a never-ending,
endless summer vacation.

326
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,625
In the world we're in now, the
future doesn't exist anymore.

327
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,000
All time stops at
September the 1st.

328
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,458
That's the reason Miss Asahina
can't travel to the future.

329
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,208
It's only natural.

330
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,166
Look, there's nothing natural
about not having a future.

331
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,416
And who's gonna
believe such a thing?

332
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,708
Well, for starters, we were sort
of hoping you would believe it.

333
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,750
[KYON sighs]

334
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,083
For what it's worth, I can
try to explain it, too.

335
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,375
Here goes...

336
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,875
Because I have to
classified information,

337
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,333
I have to use
classified information

338
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:07,000
to contact the future.

339
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,666
The thing is, for a week now,
I haven't gotten any...

340
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,416
...classified information.

341
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,250
That's kind of weird.

342
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,791
I was so surprised that I...
classified information.

343
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:25,583
I did, but it was
classified information.

344
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,041
And now, I don't know...
what to do...

345
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,125
[sobbing continues]

346
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,875
[KYON] I don't know how to
help you, but I'm wondering...

347
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,208
Are all the classified
information things

348
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,000
you're talking about stuff
you can't say on TV?

349
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,916
What about those closed spaces
you were talking about before?

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,833
Do you think it could
be one of those?

351
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,375
No, it isn't one of those.

352
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,666
What happened is that
a specific section of time

353
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,000
has been torn away.

354
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,500
At exactly midnight
on August the 31st,

355
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,666
everything as we
know it, is reset.

356
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,500
Then time loops back on itself,

357
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,708
back to the morning
of August the 17th.

358
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,333
That's the process.

359
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,625
[grunts]

360
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,083
Then what about our--

361
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,541
Wait, what about the
whole world's memories?

362
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,250
[KOIZUMI]
Those get reset as well.

363
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,375
Everyone's memory starts
over from the beginning.

364
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,333
Perfect, another
problem involving time.

365
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,083
But I guess that's
to be expected

366
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,291
when there's a time
traveler around, huh?

367
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,208
Oh, no, Miss Asahina didn't
have anything to do with this.

368
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,541
Okay then, what's causing it?

369
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,333
It's Miss Suzumiya.

370
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,541
[sighs]

371
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,625
I'm sure she doesn't
even realize it though.

372
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,416
But I do think that deep
down inside herself,

373
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,333
she'd prefer it if summer
vacation would last forever.

374
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,500
You're kidding me!

375
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,416
You mean she still
hasn't had enough fun?

376
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,750
That's what I think.

377
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,583
Perhaps she feels there's
something else that

378
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,750
has to happen before our
summer vacation can end.

379
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,708
[sighs]

380
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,958
[KYON] Oh, man...
The trouble she gets us into

381
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,250
is always galactic in scale.

382
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,458
Right, what do you
want me to do about it?

383
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,708
If I knew that, we would have
this problem solved by now.

384
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,416
You sure seem like you're
enjoying this an awful lot,

385
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
what's up?

386
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,958
Please don't take
that the wrong way.

387
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,791
But, this explains the feelings
of déjà vu I've been having.

388
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,000
And the ones you've
been having as well.

389
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,583
And now that I think about it,

390
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,083
those feelings were probably
the residue of our memories

391
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,666
from all the instances
where time was reset.

392
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,875
Are we the only ones?

393
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,916
Or can other people feel
this happening, too?

394
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,750
It doesn't seem that way.

395
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,750
But then again, you and I
are exceptions to the rule.

396
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,458
The only people who can sense
this strange thing happening

397
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,125
are the ones who are
closest to Miss Suzumiya.

398
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,625
But what about Haruhi?

399
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,041
Do you think she has any
idea what's been going on?

400
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,541
No, I don't think
she knows about it.

401
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,875
Besides, it would be
very bad for us if she did.

402
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,500
Although...

403
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,375
There is someone else who isn't
affected by feelings of déjà vu.

404
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,875
As a matter of fact, this person
remembers everything

405
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,166
that's happened since
this whole thing started.

406
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,208
Stop holding out
on me. Who is it?

407
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,291
You already know who it is.

408
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,916
It's Miss Nagato.

409
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,875
The thought entity
transcends space and time,

410
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,583
and so does she.

411
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,291
Is that really true?

412
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,625
[NAGATO]
It is.

413
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,916
Then you can
remember everything.

414
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
[NAGATO]
I can.

415
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,625
So then, do you know
how many times

416
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,625
this has happened
to us up till now?

417
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,708
This would be
15, 524 times so far.

418
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,250
[KYON gasps]

419
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,958
[KYON] Fifteen thousand
five-hundred twenty-four?

420
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,958
What do you mean 15,524?

421
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,541
Nagato... What are you saying?

422
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,750
You're completely
serious about that?

423
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,666
I am.

424
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,833
[MIKURU whimpers]

425
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,250
[KYON] So what you're
telling me is that

426
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,750
we've done the
exact same things,

427
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,708
every time, that many times?

428
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,541
[NAGATO]
Not necessarily.

429
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:42,458
Throughout 15,524 repetitions,
we did not attend

430
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:49,166
a bon festival the 2,391st
time and the 11,054th time.

431
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,750
We went to a bon festival
but did not go to

432
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,708
a goldfish scooping
booth 437 times.

433
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,583
--We obtained part-time jobs...
--[KYON] Okay! I got it...

434
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,333
[KYON] Fifteen thousand
five-hundred twenty-fourtimes...

435
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,000
That's what she said.

436
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:13,833
Times two weeks... That's,
uh... about... 595 years!

437
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,291
And she's the only
one who remembers

438
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,750
everything we
did all those times.

439
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,375
She's been repeating them,
over and over.

440
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,916
Nagato...

441
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,416
What's it like to re-live the
same things that many times?

442
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,458
That, has gotta be
the craziest story ever.

443
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,458
[KYON] The next night,
we went stargazing.

444
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,875
We were on the balcony
of Nagato's apartment.

445
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,291
And Koizumi brought
the telescope.

446
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,208
[HARUHI]
Oh... I'm bored.

447
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,333
I'm gonna look for UFOs now.

448
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,583
Hmm...

449
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,958
[KYON]
Hm.

450
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,666
[KYON] I wish I knew
what else she wants to do.

451
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,000
Well, that's
the question, isn't it?

452
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,208
I think I just might
have an idea though.

453
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,916
What if someone were to grab
Miss Suzumiya from behind,

454
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,791
and then whispered, "I love
you," right into her ear?

455
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,791
[KYON gasps]

456
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,750
And who's gonna be doing this?!

457
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,500
Who else could play
that role, other than you?

458
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,875
Yeah, I knew you
were gonna say that.

459
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,041
Like hell.

460
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,458
All right, how 'bout
if I give it a try?

461
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,875
[chuckles] Of course,
I'm only kidding.

00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,416

00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,250
[KYON] Anyway, the next day,
we went to the batting cages.

[KYON]
Hey, Nagato...

469
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,875
You knew about
this time loop thing

470
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,833
before Miss Asahina, didn't you?

471
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,083
[NAGATO]
Yes.

472
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,375
So how come you didn't
say anything about it?

473
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:52,083
My function is to observe only.

474
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,125
All right!

[HARUHI]
Yay!

481
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,125
More time!

482
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,208
I guess that's it. We've done
everything on our list.

483
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:23,791
Hmm... But now I'm
wondering if we did enough.

484
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,500
Hmm... Oh, well. That's good.

485
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,041
Unless there's something
else you guys wanna do?

[HARUHI]
Hm?

489
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,833
Oh, okay then.

490
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,875
We did everything we set
out to do this summer,

491
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,041
so I guess that's good enough.

492
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,750
[KYON]
No, it's not.

493
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,791
You're still not satisfied.

494
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,083
Okay, guys,
we're done for today.

495
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,125
I set tomorrow
aside just in case,

496
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,291
but I guess you can
take the day off now.

497
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,750
I'll see you all at the
club room on Monday!

Wait, Haruhi.

There's that feeling again...

500
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,291
It's strong, stronger than
all the others.

501
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,458
I can't let Haruhi leave.

502
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,500
If I let her walk out that door,

503
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,250
we'll end up re-living
the past two weeks

504
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:16,916
again and again for a
thousand more times!

505
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,916
But, what should I do?
What should I say?

506
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,916
What's she been
saying all this time?

and I still haven't touched
my homework yet.

511

matter anymore.

512
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,875
There's no point in doing it.
I mean, we're just gonna keep

513
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:52,375
re-living the last couple
of weeks, right?

514
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:56,291
Whatever happens next,
whether tomorrow comes or not,

515
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,166
a different version of me
will just have to deal with it.
