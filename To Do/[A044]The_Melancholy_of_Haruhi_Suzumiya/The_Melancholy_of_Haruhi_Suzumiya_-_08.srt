1
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,208
[KYON] It was summer.
But with finals looming,

2
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,166
my usually chipper mood
was out wandering around

3
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,875
Brazil somewhere, and
it wasn't coming back

4
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,541
any time soon.

5
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,000
Hey, Kyon, do you
know what today is?

6
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,250
Is it your birthday?

7
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,166
Guess again.

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,416
[KYON]
Miss Asahina's birthday.

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,666
Wrong!

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,333
[KYON]
Koizumi or Nagato's birthday?

11
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,833
I don't even know
when those are!

12
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,333
[KYON] Since we're on the
subject, my birthday's on--

13
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,208
Yeah, whatever!

14
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,125
You have absolutely no
idea what an important day

15
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,666
today is, do you?

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,625
[KYON] It's just another
hot weekday to me,

17
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,458
if you wanna know the truth.

18
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,250
[HARUHI] Okay, tell me
what today's date is.

19
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,750
It's the seventh of July...

20
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,208
Now I get it, you've been
talking about Tanabata

21
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,458
this whole time, haven't you?

22
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,208
That's what I'm talking about!

23
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,125
Today's Tanabata!
Come on, you're Japanese!

24
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,000
You have to remember
this kinda stuff.

25
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,250
My bad.

26
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,083
Every year, I make it
a point to get involved

27
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,291
with activities like
this. But this year,

28
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,500
the SOS Brigade'll make it
the biggest event ever!

29
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,000
[KYON]
Here we go...

30
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,458
[school bell chimes]

31
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,041
[KYON] Since the spring,
whenever Haruhi sank her teeth

32
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,750
into something, I'd find myself
aimlessly running around.

33
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,583
You could say it'd
become my daily routine.

34
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:49,416
I was getting used to it.
And I hated that.

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
[knocking]

36
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,833
[MIKURU]
Come in.

37
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:52,958
Hey, guys.

38
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,166
Oh, hello!

39
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,875
Hello!

40
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,458
How's your day so far?

41
00:01:56,541 --> 00:02:00,458
Little crazy, just like every
day since I started high school.

42
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,291
[MIKURU]
Here.

43
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,708
Thanks, I needed that.

44
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,125
Why, you're very welcome.

45
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,333
[KOIZUMI]
Wanna try something new?

46
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,916
[KYON, MIKURU]
Hm?

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,875
You know, at some point, we're
gonna get bored playing Othello.

48
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,833
[KYON] Yeah, sorry, but I
don't know the rules.

49
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,541
[KOIZUMI]
Oh, that's too bad.

50
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,291
You-know-who's come up with
another harebrained scheme.

51
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,416
This is probably our
last chance to relax.

52
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,208
[door clicks]

53
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:18,833
Uh--

54
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,000
Hey-ho!

55
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,458
I know, I know,
I'm sorry I'm so late!

56
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,166
What's with the weird
greeting and that thing?

57
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,750
I found it in the forest!

58
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,083
Then it's considered private
property, you bamboo thief.

59
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,750
Look, I also made tanzaku,

60
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,083
so everyone has to
write their wishes on 'em.

61
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,291
Tanzaku?

62
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,333
That's right, today is
Tanabata, isn't it?

63
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,458
But first, there are conditions!

64
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,875
What conditions? I don't recall
anyone agreeing to anything yet.

65
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,708
Hey, Kyon, I bet you don't know
who makes everybody's wishes

66
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,541
come true during Tanabata.

67
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,333
Orihime and Hikoboshi?

68
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,458
Lucky guess. That's ten points.

69
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,541
But do you know which stars
represent Orihime and Hikoboshi?

70
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,541
I don't.

71
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,083
It's Vega and Altair.

72
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,416
Correct, sir! That's why you
hang your tanzaku to face them!

73
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,750
Eighty-five points!

74
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,708
Mind telling us where
the other 15 points went?

75
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,125
A-hem!

76
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,916
First of all, according to
the theory of relativity,

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,125
it's not possible to travel
faster than the speed of light.

78
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,958
The distance from the Earth
to Vega is 25 lightyears,

79
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,125
and to Altair it's 16.

80
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,333
That means, any information
that leaves Earth

81
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,708
is going to take at least that
much time to reach those stars!

82
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,208
I can't believe you actually
researched this stuff.

83
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,958
That's why, when you make a
wish, it takes such a long time

84
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,958
for the gods to
make it come true.

85
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,708
For example, if you wanna have
a boyfriend by this Christmas,

86
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,666
he won't show up
for you in time.

87
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,000
If it takes that long
for a wish to go one way,

88
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,875
wouldn't it take 50 or 32
years to make it back?

89
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,833
Yeah, but they're gods,
so I'm sure they have a way

90
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,708
to get around it. Like a
half-price summer bargain.

91
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,250
[KYON] So what happened to
the theory of relativity?

92
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,875
[HARUHI] There's a tanzaku
for Vega and one for Altair.

93
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,208
So the trick is to make wishes
you'd want to come true

94
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,041
25 or 16 years from now!

95
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,333
[KYON] How can we know
what we'll be doing

96
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,291
25 or even 16 years from now?

97
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,208
What the heck are we
supposed to wish for?

98
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,583
She's always coming up with
these irrational activities

99
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,750
for us to do. I keep wondering:
which part of the universe

100
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,750
does she get her idea
of "normal" from?

101
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,416
Don't be so quick to judge.
Despite her actions,

102
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,166
Miss Suzumiya has a firm
grasp of what normal is.

103
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,083
How can you be
so sure about that?

104
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,750
Well, for one thing, she wants
the world to be a bit more

105
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,166
exciting and unusual,
and she has the power

106
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,458
to reshape the world
according to her whims.

107
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,750
Also, the world hasn't lost
its rationality yet, has it?

108
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,958
That's how I can be so sure.

109
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,625
Hey, cut out the whispering!

110
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,416
[KYON growls]

111
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,958
[KYON] I dunno if she's
got the hang of this thing.

112
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,208
I'm afraid mine are
a little ordinary.

113
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,291
Yeah, that's pathetic.

114
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,625
Shut it.

115
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,750
That settles it, mine
are better than yours.

116
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,708
It's apples and oranges.

117
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,250
Make sure you guys remember
the wishes you made today.

118
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,291
It's only 16 years till
the first batch comes true.

119
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:01,416
And then we're gonna see who's
wish Hikoboshi grants first!

120
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,208
[sighs]

121
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,375
[HARUHI] Sixteen years is
a long time, though...

122
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,791
[KYON]
Hm?

123
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,208
[KYON] After that,
Haruhi was strangely quiet,

124
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,375
and dare I say,
a bit melancholy.

125
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,458
In a way, the fact
she was so calm

126
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,041
was a little... unnerving.

127
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:32,041
And the quieter she was,
the more worried I became.

128
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,083
Would you like me to
pour you another cup?

129
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,083
Ah. Oh, sure, I'd love one.

130
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,125
Huh?

131
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,750
Shh.

132
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,291
[KYON]
So cute.

133
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,833
Now.

134
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,250
[KYON]
You know I will!

135
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,791
I'm going home...

136
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,250
The last one out
should lock the door.

137
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,541
[KOIZUMI]
I'll be going, too.

138
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,875
[KYON]
Lucky me, lucky me.

139
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,416
Uh. Hey...

140
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,458
[KOIZUMI]
Well, see ya later.

141
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,291
Okay.

142
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,750
[door clicks]

143
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,125
Thank goodness, I thought
they'd never leave us alone.

144
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,958
[KYON] Why? Is it something you
don't want the others to hear?

145
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,833
Um, yes...

146
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:38,000
There's a... a place I
sort of wanna take you to.

147
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,791
[KYON]
Sure, where do you wanna go?

148
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,833
Well, uh...

149
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,041
It's three years ago...

150
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,416
[KYON]
Three--

151
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,583
I'm sorry! I know it sounds
really strange, but...

152
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,875
Well, will you go?

153
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,916
So, we'd be time
travelling, then?

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,416
Yes, that's right.

155
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,708
I don't have a problem
going with you or anything,

156
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,000
but why me?

157
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,083
What for?

158
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:07,625
I can't say now,
but when we get there...

159
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,666
Maybe...

160
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,916
[KYON groans]

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,416
[MIKURU] Please don't
ask me anything else!

162
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,125
Just say you'll go with me!

163
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,916
Because if you
don't go, then I'll...

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,125
[squeaks]

165
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,291
...get in trouble...

166
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,666
[KYON]
So cute.

167
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,416
Well, uh... Okay, sure, I'll go.

168
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,166
Really?!

169
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,416
Thank you!

170
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,666
[KYON]
So cute...

171
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,000
[sighs]

172
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,666
Thank goodness.

173
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,416
[KYON] Come to think of it,
my knowledge of Miss Asahina's

174
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,291
time travelling was based
solely upon her word.

175
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,791
And the only proof
I had was that

176
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,750
I'd met the adult
version of her.

177
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,250
This was my chance to confirm

178
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,208
whether she was a girl
from the future... or not.

179
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,458
Okay, show me the way
to your time machine.

180
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,791
[MIKURU]
We'll leave from here.

181
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,375
From here?

182
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,041
[MIKURU]
Kyon? Sorry.

183
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,125
Uh?

184
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,708
[KYON groans softly]

185
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,708
[MIKURU]
Oh, you're awake!

186
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:15,166
Ah... I was sort of
you'd be waking up soon,

187
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,583
because my legs
are getting numb.

188
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,583
[gasps]

189
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,666
Uh, why was I
sleeping in your lap?

190
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,750
Sorry about that.
But I can't let you see how

191
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:33,208
time travel happens
because it's classified.

192
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,333
So, uh, are you mad?

193
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,166
No, not at all. I mean, if
Haruhi tried to do that to me,

194
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,916
I'd probably smack her, but
since it's you, it's no biggie.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,375
Thank goodness.

196
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,166
Are you sure that right now
is really three years ago?

197
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,666
July the seventh
three years ago.

198
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,166
It's about 9 pm.

199
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,291
You sure about that?

200
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,666
Really sure.

201
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,875
Yeah...

202
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:54,875
Hm.

203
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,625
[KYON]
I know this park...

204
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,791
It's where Nagato told me
to meet her that one time.

205
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,583
Is this a mecca for
weirdos or something?

206
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,000
Miss Asahina?

207
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,875
Um...

208
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,875
[KYON] Okay, calm down.
Should I...? Should I not...?

209
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,750
Hello, Kyon. It's me.

210
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,500
[KYON]
Miss Asahina!

211
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,250
So this was how I looked
all asleep and everything.

212
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,708
[giggles]

213
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,916
All she had to do was get you
to come to this point in time.

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,208
It's going to be my job now to
guide you along from here on.

215
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,291
Okay, but you put her
to sleep. How come?

216
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,583
When I was here, I didn't
meet the adult version of me.

217
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,916
That's why I couldn't
let her see me here.

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,250
In this time plane, anyway.

219
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,083
Huh.

220
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,458
If you just follow the railroad
tracks, you'll come to a school.

221
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,916
You're going to have to help the
person you find at the gates.

222
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,208
And, you'll also have to
carry that version of me

223
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,458
along with you.

224
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,875
This feels like going
on a quest in a game.

225
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,708
After I'm done, do I get
something, like a reward?

226
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,250
A reward, huh?

227
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,041
Let's see...

228
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,416
I'm actually not supposed
to give you anything.

229
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,208
Although, if you really want to,

230
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,541
you can give that
version of me a kiss.

231
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,708
But only while
she's sleeping, okay?

232
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,125
That's, uh... A little...

233
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,375
[KYON]
Under the circumstances,

234
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,666
this goes completely
against my principles

235
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,041
Yeah, well, sort of.

236
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,041
That's it. It's time
for me to go now.

237
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,291
You're going to have to keep me
a secret from her, too, okay?

238
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,208
Promise me.

239
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,916
Let's pinky swear.

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,416
Uh...

241
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,791
[MIKURU]
Now it's official.

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,708
I'll see you later then, Kyon.

243
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,250
Bye-bye.

244
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,375
[KYON] I wonder how
much time had passed

245
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,166
for the adult Miss Asahina
since the last time I saw her.

246
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,666
I couldn't really tell if she'd
changed that much, if at all.

247
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,416
So now I'm starting to wonder,
is this really three years ago?

248
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,583
I need to confirm this somehow.

249
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,333
Maybe I should call
information or something.

250
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,458
East Junior High...

251
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,750
Uh... Hm.

252
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,541
[KYON]
Hey.

253
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,208
What? Who're you?

254
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,041
[KYON] Okay, now I'm sure
I've gone back three years.

255
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,083
That's Haruhi Suzumiya,
the seventh grade version.

256
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,500
Are you gonna tell me
who you are or what?

257
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,375
Pervert? Kidnapper?

258
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,708
What do you think
you're doing over there?

259
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,250
[HARUHI] Isn't it obvious?
Breaking and entering.

260
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,500
[KYON] She's committing a
crime, and announcing it.

261
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,833
How am I supposed to react?

262
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,708
I don't know who you are,
and I really don't care,

263
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,958
just gimme a hand.

264
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,000
'Cause if you don't,
I'll call the cops.

265
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,000
[KYON]
Yup, that's Haruhi, no mistake.

266
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,166
This way.

267
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,791
[KYON] Good thing it's dark out.
She won't be able to get

268
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,541
a good look at me
or Miss Asahina.

269
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,833
Since this Haruhi
from three years ago

270
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:11,208
doesn't remember us, I sort of
feel I need to keep it that way.

271
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,791
I got this from the storage room
after school and hid it.

272
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,666
Pretty smart, huh?

273
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,666
I can handle that thing.
You go grab the line marker.

274
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,708
Huh?

275
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,833
Hm.

276
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,000
[KYON]
Hm?

277
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,833
Well, whatcha gonna
do with this thing?

278
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,000
[HARUHI] You're gonna draw
lines where I tell you.

279
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:30,833
Who, me?

280
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,708
Yeah, that's right, you.

281
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,416
I am the supervisor
of this project.

282
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,958
[KYON sighs]

283
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,750
[HARUHI] Hey, that line's all
crooked! What're you doing?!

284
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,666
[KYON] Ordering around a
high schooler she just met

285
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,750
without any hesitation
is so very Haruhi.

286
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,000
Now, if I had met this girl

287
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,416
back when I was going to
junior high, I guarantee

288
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,750
I would've thought she
was 100% nuts. No joke.

289
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,500
So, I ran around and drew
white lines on the ground

290
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,000
wherever Haruhi
told me to draw them.

291
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:00,458
I remember Taniguchi telling me
about a mysterious message.

292
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,583
Never dreamed I'd be
the one who drew it.

293
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,958
[HARUHI]
Yeah, I guess it'll do.

294
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,541
[KYON]
Whatever.

295
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,916
So do you think aliens
are real, or not?

296
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,166
That's sorta random.

297
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,375
Just answer the question.

298
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,500
I guess they are.

299
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,041
And time travelers?

300
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,708
I wouldn't doubt those, either.

301
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,166
How about ESPers?

302
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,083
I'm sure they're lurking
around every corner.

303
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,333
What about Sliders?

304
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,791
I haven't met any
of those guys yet.

305
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,916
[HARUHI]
Hm...

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,833
Is that a North High uniform?

307
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,750
[KYON]
Uh-huh.

308
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,250
[HARUHI]
What's your name anyway?

309
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,541
It's John Smith.

310
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,875
[growls] You're such a dork.

311
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,500
[KYON] Let's just say
I wanna remain anonymous.

312
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,000
[HARUHI] Who's the girl
you were carrying?

313
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,625
[KYON]
She's my big sister

314
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,291
and she has these
sudden fits of narcolepsy.

315
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,625
She just falls asleep wherever,

316
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,916
so I have to carry
her sometimes.

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,250
[HARUHI]
Hmph!

318
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,250
[KYON] Anyway, what's that
thing supposed to be?

319
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,750
[HARUHI] What do ya think
it looks like? It's a message.

320
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,625
[KYON] A message for Orihime
or Hikoboshi, right?

321
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,125
Okay, how'd you know that?

322
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,291
Well, it is Tanabata. And I
remembered someone I know

323
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,125
doing something similar once.

324
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,958
Oh, yeah? I'd love to
meet someone like that.

325
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,916
Does that person go
to North High, too?

326
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,041
Sort of.

327
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,333
[HARUHI]
Hm... North High...

328
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,416
[HARUHI]
I'm done. I'm goin' home now.

329
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,916
See ya!

330
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,208
[KYON] She didn't even thank me
for helping her. Typical.

331
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,541
[KYON]
Miss Asahina?

332
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,875
Yes... class...

333
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:32,958
[gasps]

334
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,875
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where am I?!
What happened,

335
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,500
and when is it right now?!

336
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,333
--Well, uh--
--[screams]

337
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,541
I don't have my TPDD anymore!

338
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,375
Huh?

339
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,333
I don't have it!

340
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,583
[wails]

341
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:52,083
What's wrong?
What's a TPDD, anyway?

342
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,416
[MIKURU]
It's classified, but,

343
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,708
it's sort of like a
time machine... [sobs]

344
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,916
Where do you think
it could've gone?

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,125
[MIKURU] I don't know! I should
have it, but I-I lost it!

346
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,583
Is there anybody who
could come pick us up?

347
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,916
[MIKURU]
There isn't!

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,333
Okay, so what's gonna
happen to us then?

349
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,625
We're stuck. We're stuck
in this time plane

350
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,208
three years in the past
with no way of getting home,

351
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,750
and we can't get
back to our time!

352
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,750
That sounds pretty serious.

353
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,291
Super serious... [wails]

354
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,500
[KYON]
For some reason,

355
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,125
I wasn't too concerned
about our situation.

356
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:33,583
That TPDD thing was probably
taken by the adult Miss Asahina.

357
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,083
In fact, that's probably
why she was here.

358
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,208
To make sure this version of her

359
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,000
actually lost the
TPDD thingamajig--

360
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,375
[gasps]

361
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,250
Everything's gonna be okay.

362
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,541
Huh...?

363
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,666
[ringing]

364
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,500
Does a Miss Yuki
Nagato live here?

365
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,416
Uh... I'm not really
sure how to say

366
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,000
what I'm about
to say, but...

367
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,791
What if I told you that I'm an
acquaintance of Haruhi Suzumiya?

368
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,708
[doorbell rings]

369
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,791
Howdy.

370
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,250
Is it okay if we come in?

371
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,125
[KYON]
That's pretty much it.

372
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,375
Now you know who we are
and why we're here.

373
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:38,333
Oh, and the you from three years
in the future gave me this.

374
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,083
Understood.

375
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,625
As for as everything goes, this
is the first time you've met

376
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,625
the two of us, right?

377
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,708
Yes, I have accessed the memory

378
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,625
of the unit in the
other time plane,

379
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,041
and I have downloaded the
data from the opposite side

380
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,000
of the linked-time boundary.

381
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,250
The unit that exists
three years from now and I

382
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,666
are the same being.

383
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,375
As such, we have access
to each other's memories.

384
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,750
Our memories are shared.

385
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:07,875
Really? How?

386
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,833
We synched.

387
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,041
Wait, I don't understand.

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,125
[gasps]

389
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,791
Why are you wearing
a North High uniform?

390
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,208
Have you enrolled already?

391
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,291
[NAGATO] Not yet. I am
currently in standby mode.

392
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,708
[KYON]
What?

393
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,000
So you're gonna be in standby
mode for three years?

394
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,375
[NAGATO]
Yes.

395
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,583
That's a really long time
to be in standby mode.

396
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,500
It is my role.

397
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,166
There is more than one way
to travel through time.

398
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,708
The TPDD is not the only
device that can do it.

399
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,083
It is imperfect.

400
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,916
But, um... How is it imperfect?

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,208
When an organic lifeform
uses the TPDD,

402
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,000
the movement created by
the event causes noise.

403
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,875
We believe it is
imperfect and primitive.

404
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,541
By "we", you mean that
thought entity-thing.

405
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,000
So, Miss Nagato, when you
travel through time,

406
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,666
you can do it perfectly?

407
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,583
Perfection does not matter.

408
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,833
As long as data can
travel unobstructed.

409
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,458
[gasps]

410
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,625
D-Do you want us
to sleep in here?

411
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,833
Us? Together?

412
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:24,833
Yes.

413
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,333
Me and Miss Asahina...

414
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,208
[NAGATO]
Yes.

415
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,166
Lie down.

416
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,000
Just like that?!

417
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,416
Just sleep.

418
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,250
[KYON] I wouldn't have it
any other way, however...

419
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,916
I guess we don't have
any other choice, do we?

420
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,458
Nuh-uh...

421
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,041
[MIKURU squeaks]

422
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,541
[gasps]

423
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,250
Huh?

424
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,500
[KYON]
Huh...?

425
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,625
[MIKURU gasps]
No way!

426
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,833
[KYON] Are you okay?
What's that? The TPDD?

427
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,208
No, it's not. It's just
my radio wave watch.

428
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,750
We're back in our
time, thank goodness.

429
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:28,250
It's just after 9:30, July
the seventh, the day we left.

430
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,916
[sighs]

431
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,291
How did you do it?

432
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,458
I suspended the flow of data
inside this time-space.

433
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,416
Then I released it at
a pre-determined point

434
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,125
in the time-space continuum.

435
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,458
You mean you actually
stopped time?!

436
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,500
[KYON]
Huh?

437
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,250
Miss Nagato's saying
she stopped time

438
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,291
in this room for
the past 3 years.

439
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:51,000
And when today came around,
she started time up again.

440
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,125
That right?

441
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:52,958
[NAGATO]
Yes.

442
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,291
I can't believe it.

443
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,375
If that's true,
then that means...

444
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,583
On the night when I came over,

445
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,125
and you told me
you were an alien

446
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,916
and stuff, Miss Asahina and
I were asleep in this room

447
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,541
together the whole time?!

448
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,666
[NAGATO]
Yes.

449
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,708
[gasps]

450
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,000
I was always impressed at
how amazing you could be,

451
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,000
but I didn't know
you are omnipotent.

452
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:17,458
I am not. This was a
special case. Emergency mode.

453
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:21,750
Seldom activated
unless necessary.

454
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,666
[KYON]
Thank you.

455
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,833
You're welcome.

456
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,333
[KYON]
Hm?

457
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,916
Before we go, could you
tell me what this says?

458
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,375
"I am right here,"
is what is says.

459
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,000
Hold on a second, are you
telling me that this thing

460
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,750
is written in a language
used by aliens or something?

461
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,166
[KYON]
Nagato didn't answer me.

462
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,333
[MIKURU]
I'm sorry, it's just that...

463
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,291
I-I don't really know too much.

464
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:01,041
I'm just an assistant.
No, an intern.

465
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,166
Wait, no, I mean I'm
kind of like a trainee.

466
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,041
But even so, you get to
stay pretty close to Haruhi.

467
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,541
That's because
Miss Suzumiya caught me.

468
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:13,208
I never expected something
like that to happen.

469
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,625
[MIKURU] I'm just following the
orders given by my superiors.

470
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,250
Or, what's another term?
The people in charge?

471
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:28,000
I just follow orders, that's why
sometimes I don't understand

472
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,708
the things I'm supposed to do.

473
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,458
[KYON] I wonder if the
grown up Miss Asahina

474
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,666
is one of her superiors.

475
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,250
If that's the case, then the
adult Miss Asahina knows

476
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,500
how things'll turn out for us.

477
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,791
But for some reason, she
didn't tell this Miss Asahina

478
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,166
anything about it.

479
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,833
Oh well, I guess people from
the future have their own way

480
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,125
of doing things.

481
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,416
Maybe when stuff starts
falling into place,

482
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,208
someone will explain
everything to her.

483
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,416
[KYON] Of course, the next
day was July the 8th.

484
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,583
And even though I knew
it was the next day.

485
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,208
In reality, it had been
three years and one day

486
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,208
since I'd been back to school.

487
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,458
[KYON]
Hm?

488
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,791
What's wrong? You eat a
poisonous mushroom or something?

489
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,208
[HARUHI] No, just thinkin'
about some stuff.

490
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:19,208
I remembered something about
Tanabata from a while ago.

491
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,666
Really?

492
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,041
[KYON]
Hey, Nagato,

493
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,333
Miss Asahina's really
from the future, right?

494
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,791
Yes.

495
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,666
Yeah, well, something about
the process of time travel

496
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,333
and how the past and
future are linked

497
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,000
seems a little off to me.

498
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,500
What d'you mean?

499
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,625
[KYON] Miss Asahina told me once
that there's no connection

500
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,875
between the past and the future.

501
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,083
So, I go back three years,
bump into Haruhi,

502
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,083
and tell her some stuff that
I didn't think was important.

503
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,541
But there's a chance
that what I told her

504
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,833
is the reason she decided
on coming to North High

505
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,791
and why she began
looking for people...

506
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,833
...who weren't normal.

507
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,333
So there has to be a link

508
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,541
between the past and
the future, right?

509
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,041
Even though it contradicts
what Miss Asahina said.

510
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,708
A theory that is contradictory
in itself cannot begin

511
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:06,250
to explain the contradictions
inherent within it.

512
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,791
If that was supposed to be an
explanation, I didn't understand

513
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,166
a word of it.

514
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,250
One day, you will.

515
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,791
[KOIZUMI]
This is what she means.

516
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,125
Using our game as an example,
notice that my King is in check

517
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,375
by your Rook.

518
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,833
"This is terrible!

519
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,250
Oh, I think I'll run away."

520
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,958
See that? Can you tell me
what was contradictory

521
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,666
about what I just did?

522
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,833
Of course, as far as our
little group is concerned,

523
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,708
the King isn't so important.

524
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,000
To everyone here, the only
thing that really matters

525
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,250
is the Queen.

526
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,750
Yeah, whatever. I don't
know what's gonna happen

527
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,500
to us next, but whatever it is,

528
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,208
I want it to be something
that doesn't require

529
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,625
as much thinking.

530
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,791
[KOIZUMI] I'd love it if
things stayed nice and quiet.

531
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,666
But you would prefer it
if something happened?

532
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,291
[growls]

533
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,625
[KYON]
Jerk.
