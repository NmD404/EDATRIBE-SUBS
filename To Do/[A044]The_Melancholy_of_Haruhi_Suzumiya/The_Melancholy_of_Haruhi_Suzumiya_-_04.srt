1
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,708
[ASAKURA] You want me to
take you to see the nurse?

2
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,000
[KYON]
Hmm...?

3
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,791
[sighs]

4
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,208
Good morning.

5
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,833
I don't think she's
feeling too well.

6
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,791
Take care of her, hm!

7
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,250
[KYON sighs]

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,541
[KYON] So why didn't
you come by yesterday?

9
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,208
Thought you wanted to have a
review session or something?

10
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,291
[HARUHI]
Shut up.

11
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,166
I had a review session
by myself, okay?

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,458
[KYON]
With a little prodding,

13
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,333
Haruhi told me that
after school yesterday,

14
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,291
she'd gone back and
walked the entire course

15
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,541
we covered on
Saturday by herself.

16
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,041
[HARUHI]
It's hot and I'm tired.

17
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,083
When do we get to
change uniforms?

18
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,291
I wanna change into
my summer uniform now.

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,625
Suzumiya, I know I
said this already,

20
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,208
but why don't you just quit

21
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,458
searching for these mysteries
you're never gonna find, okay?

22
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,958
I mean, why don't you
go out and have fun

23
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,125
like a normal high school
student for a change?

24
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,750
What kind of fun does a normal
high school student have?

25
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,458
How 'bout you find a nice guy
and go walking around the city

26
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,916
looking for strange things?

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,625
It's a date, so you can kill
two birds with one stone.

28
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,125
[HARUHI]
Huh. What do I care about men?

29
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,375
Romantic emotions are
nothing but a passing phase.

30
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,333
Just a form of mental illness.

31
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,500
Heck, every now then,
even I get into the mood for

32
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,166
dumb stuff like that.

33
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,458
I'm a healthy young woman;
I've got needs.

34
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,000
Sometimes I don't know
what to do with myself.

35
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,916
But I'm not stupid enough to
get stuck with all of that grief

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,208
just because of some momentary
urge to get all mushy.

37
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,958
Besides, if I went out and
really started boy hunting,

38
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,416
what's gonna happen
to the SOS Brigade?

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,833
I mean, I just
created the thing.

40
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,666
You could just change the
Brigade into some sort of

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,250
random club that has fun

42
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,708
and you'll have a
ton of people in it.

43
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,791
No way! I made the SOS Brigade

44
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,916
because that stuff's
totally boring.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,458
I mean, I gotta moe character

46
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,333
and a mysterious
transfer student,

47
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,958
so why hasn't anything
happened yet?!

48
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,916
Oh, why can't a couple of weird
things happen right now?

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,750
[ASAKURA] Don't go asking
for trouble like that.

50
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,916
But then again, it might
actually be kinda neat

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,541
if something were to come along
and turn our everyday lives

52
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,583
into something more fun.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,208
[sighs]

54
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,375
[KYON] This is a p  never seen Haruhi this down.

55
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,916
Isn't her dejected
little face cute though?

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,833
I wonder if Miss Suzumiya's
in love or something?

57
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,416
Impossible.

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,333
[KYON] Okay, Suzumiya falling
in love and, or something weird

59
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,291
popping up to make her
happy are two things

60
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,916
that will definitely not
happen any time soon.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,208
Wrong.

62
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,083
Actually, something weird
was quietly lurking

63
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,833
just around the corner.

64
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,833
[KYON] That morning
as I talked to Haruhi,

65
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,333
I was actually thinking
about something else.

66
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,666
[TEACHER] And now, without
an enemy, Umako Sagano

67
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,083
became tremendously arrogant.

68
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,666
[KYON] Didn't something
like this happen before?

69
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,083
Yo.

70
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,083
[KYON] It was pretty obvious
the handwriting wasn't Nagato's.

71
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,208
Besides, she's not really
the type to go around

72
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,000
putting messages in
a guy's shoe locker.

73
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,208
Could it've been Miss Asahina?

74
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,666
Nah, no way. She'd set
a specific time to meet,

75
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,375
and I doubt she'd
scribble it on paper

76
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,083
torn out of a memo pad.

77
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,375
[door opens]

78
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,833
--[HARUHI] Oh, it's so hot!
--[KYON] Haruhi...

79
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,083
[KYON] Impossible. She'd
just grab me by the collar

80
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,625
and drag me over
to the stairwell

81
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,041
just the like last time.

82
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,083
And Koizumi would just say,
"Hey, let's talk."

83
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,458
[HARUHI sighs]

84
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,583
We definitely need
an air conditioner.

85
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,875
[KYON]
Clearly it's not a love letter.

86
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,833
All I know is, it's
requesting my presence

87
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,458
at a specific location.

88
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,083
Wait a sec... maybe
Tanaguchi and Kunikida

89
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,625
are playing some kinda joke.

90
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,708
Yeah, that's it. That's the
most logical possibility.

91
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:32,666
Although, I'd expect more
if those two were involved.

92
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,166
Wait! What the heck's that?!

93
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,666
What? They're just pictures.

94
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,625
They're totally cute
shots of Mikuru!

95
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,791
[KYON]
Yeah, I see that!

96
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,208
What the hell're you
doing with these?!

97
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,166
I'm loading them onto the
main page of our website!

98
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,333
Now we'll get tons of email
about cool, weird happenings!

99
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,625
Our site'll get tens
of thousands of hits!

100
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,625
The counter will roll
so high, it'll be nuts!

101
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,375
Wonder if the counter
even goes that high...?

102
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,416
Wait!

103
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,750
Ah! What're you doing,
you idiot?!

104
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,625
I'm putting an end to this.

105
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,875
[KYON] If Miss Asahina found
out that the entire planet

106
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,166
could see pictures of her
wearing that maid outfit--

107
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,958
in stunning poses, I might add--

108
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,125
she would pass out on the spot.

109
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,833
Haruhi glared at me as I
feverishly tried to explain

110
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,083
to her why this was
such a bad thing.

111
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,541
In the end, I don't know if she
understood how dangerous

112
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,875
it was to put such personal
stuff on the internet

113
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,916
where any creep could access it.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,125
[HARUHI]
Hmph. Fine, whatever!

115
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,541
[KYON] She reluctantly
agreed to trash them.

116
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,166
Now, this would've been
the time to delete

117
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,125
the photos once and for all,

118
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,875
but it would be a shame
to waste 'em...

119
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,333
[KYON]
There!

120
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,375
That's it. I'm going home.

121
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,541
Huh?

122
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,458
[MIKURU gasps]

123
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,833
Oh, I'm sorry!

124
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,500
Ah...

125
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,833
Uh...

126
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,250
Did something happen?

127
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,958
No, everything's a-okay.

128
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,791
An evil conspiracy's
just been vanquished.

129
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,291
[KYON] Since we had nothing
to do, I was playing Othello

130
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,458
with Miss Asahina when
Koizumi came in

131
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,958
with that smile of his.

132
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,750
Sorry, guys, but I gotta leave
early today to go to work.

133
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,041
[KYON] I wonder what
kind of job he's got?

134
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,041
I'm gonna change,
so don't wait for me.

135
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,333
[KYON] Taking advantage
of Miss Asahina's request,

136
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,291
I bolted from the room.

137
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,541
[KYON] Seeing her standing
there caught me off guard,

138
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,041
to say the least.

139
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,041
Why don't you come in?

140
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,625
It was you...

141
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,333
Yes. Are you surprised?

142
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,833
[KYON]
What d'you want?

143
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,833
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

144
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,916
Actually, it's a question I had.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,333
It's about Miss Suzumiya.

146
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,666
What do you think of her?

147
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,375
[KYON] Oh brother, she's
onto Suzumiya as well.

148
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,083
People always say that
it's much better to regret

149
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,375
something you did rather than
regret something you didn't do.

150
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,250
What do you think about that?

151
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,041
Well, I'm not really sure people
always say that, but I think

152
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,583
it means what it means.

153
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,791
Well, then, let's pretend if you
knew that if you kept things

154
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,958
exactly the same as
they are right now,

155
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,666
you'd be completely broke.

156
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,666
And let's say you that just
didn't know how you could

157
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,875
possibly make things any better.

158
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,583
I wonder what you'd
do about that?

159
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,875
I don't understand.

160
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,958
Are you talking about
the Japanese Economy?

161
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,125
As a start, wouldn't you think
about trying to change

162
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,666
something, anything?

163
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,375
I mean, nothing is going
to change if you

164
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,791
stay the same, right?

165
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,875
Well, yeah, I guess if you're
gonna put it that way.

166
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,708
Then you agree with me!

167
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,166
But you know, my superiors
are extremely stubborn

168
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,166
and lack any vision whatsoever.

169
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,458
But you can't have that kind
of thinking out in the field.

170
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,625
If you just twiddle your thumbs,
things'll go from bad to worse.

171
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,125
And if that's the case, wouldn't
it be okay to force change

172
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,625
to happen when you know
it's all for the best?

173
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,083
[KYON]
What's she talking about?

174
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,625
Is there a hidden
camera in here?

175
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,083
Is Tanaguchi hiding
in the closet,

176
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,666
laughing at me right now?

177
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,583
[ASAKURA] I'm getting bored and
just fed up watching something

178
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,708
that doesn't seem to
be changing at all.

179
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,958
That's why I'm going
to kill you and see how

180
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,625
Miss Suzumiya reacts.

181
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,041
[KYON gasps]

182
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,250
[gasps]

183
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,291
[KYON]
What the hell?!

184
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,750
Is she serious?!

185
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,875
Wait, hang on.
What just happened?

186
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,666
Why is Asakura coming
after me with a knife?

187
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,791
Whoa, wait a minute,
what did she just say?

188
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,750
"I'm gonna kill you"?

189
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,291
Naze... why?

190
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,250
Stop kidding around! You're
gonna hurt someone with that!

191
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,333
Even if that's a rubber knife,

192
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,708
you're scaring
the hell outta me!

193
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,541
You think it's a... joke?

194
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,666
Huh...

195
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,166
You don't wanna die?

196
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,708
You don't want me to kill you?

197
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,208
I'm sorry, but I just don't
understand the concept of death

198
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,916
regarding organic lifeforms.

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,791
Okay, this isn't funny anymore!

200
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,416
I don't know why you're
doing this, but please,

201
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,916
just put the knife down!

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,125
Heh. I can't.

203
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,833
Because whether you
care about it or not,

204
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,083
I really do want you to die.

205
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,708
[gasps]

206
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,250
[ASAKURA]
It's useless.

207
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,541
Right now, I have the control
over the flow of the data

208
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,916
in this space.

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,500
Nothing can enter,
nothing can leave.

210
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,458
[KYON] I have no idea
what's going on here.

211
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,166
If anybody understands,
get the hell over here

212
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,500
and explain it to me!

213
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,208
Oh, please, won't
you just give up?

214
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,458
You're gonna die no matter what,
so let me kill you.

215
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,791
[KYON] Just what the
hell are you anyway?

216
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,625
[yells]

217
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,291
Ah-ah...

218
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,958
I already told you it's useless.

219
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,666
Everything in the classroom
is now under my control.

220
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,625
[KYON]
Wait, wait, wait!

221
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,958
What the hell's going on?!

222
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,666
She's gonna kill me to
see how Haruhi reacts?

223
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,083
Haruhi, Haruhi!
Man, she's popular!

224
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,000
And if that's the case,
then why am I the one

225
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,250
that's gotta die?!

226
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,208
Silly me, I shoulda done
this from the get-go.

227
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,416
[gasps]

228
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,750
[KYON] I can't move!
Wait, that's not fair!

229
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,375
Your death is the
perfect way to make

230
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,541
Haruhi Suzumiya take some
sort of action, you see?

231
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,916
Finally, I'll be able to observe
a huge explosion of data.

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,833
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity!

233
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,583
[KYON]
Tell me about it!

234
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,666
Now you die.

239
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,166

I can move!

[ASAKURA gasps]

242
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,000
[NAGATO]
There are flaws in your program.

243
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,458
Your data shut down and spatial
blockades are faulty.

244
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,916
It is how I detected you,
why I was allowed inside.

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,708
You stopped me?
But if I kill this human,

246
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,666
Haruhi Suzumiya is bound to
do something interesting.

247
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,708
It's the only way for us
to acquire more information.

248
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,166
You are supposed to
be my back-up unit.

249
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,666
You are not permitted
to act on your own.

250
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,625
You'll obey my orders.

251
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,875
[ASAKURA]
What if I said no?

252
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,958
Your data link will
be terminated.

253
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,041
[ASAKURA] Would you like to try?
In here, I have the upper hand.

254
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,250
This classroom is a space
where I control the data.

255
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,625
Commence request for
data link termination.

It was right about this time

259
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,541
that I was thinking to myself...

00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,708
Oh, man, these girls
really aren't human...

don't look fine at all.

[ASAKURA] With that
much damage, I'm afraid

280
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,833
you won't be able to interfere
with any other data.

281
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,291
Well, I'll finish it.

282
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,833
Now you die.

284
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,958
It's over.

285
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,291
What's over?

286
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,916
Do you mean your life for
the last three years?

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,500
[NAGATO] No. Commence
termination of data link.

288
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,958
It can't be!

289
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,333
[NAGATO] You are an advanced
interface. That is why it took

290
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,375
so long to hack into
this time-space program.

291
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,708
But it's over now.

292
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:54,583
You modified your program with a
detonation element, didn't you?

293
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,250
I thought you seemed weak,
but that explains it.

294
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,791
That's the reason you used
all your attack data when

295
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,166
you started to fight.

296
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,625
Oh, this is a shame.

297
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:06,208
I guess I really was just
a back-up interface.

298
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,416
I thought this was my big
chance to get something

299
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,125

But please be careful though.

303
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,458
The data integration thought
entity has more interfaces

that are just like me.

305
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,166
Someday, you might meet
another interface that also

306
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,916
seeks radical change.
Or perhaps the one pulling

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,916
Nagato's strings
will change his mind?

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,916
Till then, enjoy your life
with Miss Suzumiya. Goodbye.

Hang on! I'll get some help.

No. My physical injuries
are not critical.

313
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,166
This space needs to be corrected
before I do anything else.

314
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,208
The corrupt data must be removed

Are you sure you're really okay?

I don't really have a

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,416
or any of her other delusions.

347
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,541
No, what happened
just now made me realize

348
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,500
what real danger feels like.

349
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,833
I was five seconds
away from dying.

350
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,750
There's no longer any
doubt in my mind that

351
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,000
Nagato is an alien, or is
at least involved with

352
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,958
aliens in some fashion.

353
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,625
[KYON]
The next day, Ryoko Asakura was

354
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,500
mysteriously absent from class.

355
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,125
[TEACHER] ...almost overnight
it seems. She transferred out.

356
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,666
[STUDENT]
Where did she transfer?!

357
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,958
--[STUDENTS gasping]
--Huh?!

358
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,833
Kyon! Hear that?! A mystery!

359
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,583
[KYON] Filled with boundless
energy, Haruhi had that glimmer

360
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,000
in her eye again.
What should I do?

361
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,625
Should I tell her the truth?

362
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,583
[KYON] No way. Actually,
I don't wanna tell her.

363
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:52,125
I keep hoping that everything
I saw was just a hallucination.

364
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,541
This is too good to be true!

365
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,625
First, a mysterious
student transfers in,

366
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,000
now, a girl mysteriously
transfers out!

367
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,958
We are so investigating this!

368
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,583
[KYON] Right now, I can't
deal with the extra work.

369
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,416
I have another matter;
a pending inquiry, if you will,

370
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,708
that I'm mulling over.

371
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,291
What's with you?

372
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,625
It's nothing.

373
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,708
[KYON] Today's communique
was conveniently housed

374
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,250
within an envelope.

375
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,708
I found it in my shoe locker
just like the note yesterday.

376
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,250
I mean, seriously, is putting
notes in people's shoe locker

377
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,833
some new trend? Well,
thing is, this time around,

378
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,416
it's different.

379
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,125
[crash]

380
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,708
[KYON] I have to be careful.
I don't wanna waltz in there

381
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,708
just to face another life
or death situation.

382
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,166
It doesn't matter, though,
'cause I'm going anyway.

383
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,458
I mean, Miss Asahina wanted
to see me in private.

384
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,500
Now, I don't have any
proof that Miss Asahina

385
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,875
actually sent this letter,
but I know in my gut

386
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,333
that she did, okay?

387
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,416
She's definitely the type
that would send little notes

388
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,000
to people, and the image I'm
seeing of her scribbling away

389
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,541
on super-cute stationary
fits her personality to a T.

390
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,958
Besides, it's the clubroom.
Nagato's gonna be there.

391
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,125
Well, here goes nothing.

392
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,333
[knocks]

393
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,791
[MIKURU]
Ah, come in!

394
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,333
Hi, Kyon.

395
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,666
It's been ages.

396
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,125
[KYON] She sure looks
like Miss Asahina,

397
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,500
but she definitely
is not Miss Asahina.

398
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,375
Um, are you Miss
Asahina's big sister?

399
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,375
[gasps, giggles]

400
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,791
But it's me, Kyon.

401
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,708
I'm Mikuru Asahina.

402
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,333
I'm the me from a future
that's a little further down

403
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,083
form the me you know right now.

404
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,000
I wanted to see you.

405
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,625
Hey! You don't trust me?!

406
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,166
Okay, this'll prove it.

407
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,625
See, I've got it a tiny
star-shaped mole right here.

408
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,208
It's not a fake mole, either.

409
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,000
Wanna touch it?

410
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:37,958
[KYON]
Super-size me!

411
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,458
[ASAKURA]
You believe me now?

412
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,708
[KYON] Whether I believe her
or not, I don't recall where

413
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,458
Miss Asahina keeps her moles.

414
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,375
The only time I was able to
see that much of her body

415
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,541
was when she was cosplaying
as a bunny girl.

416
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,500
And that other time when I
peeked in as she changed--

417
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,500
which wasn't my fault!

418
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,833
I never saw any moles because
I never made it a point

419
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,708
to go looking for them.

420
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,041
Oh? Well, I remember
that you were the one

421
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,958
who told me that I
had a mole here.

422
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,333
I didn't even know I had
one there until you--

423
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,375
[gasps]

424
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,916
I... just... Oh no!

425
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,416
This is before we--

426
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,916
Oh, what have I done?!
I totally screwed up just now.

427
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,083
I'm sorry, Kyon, just forget
everything I said, okay?

428
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,041
[KYON]
Easy for you to say.

429
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,791
It's all right, really.
I believe you, I do.

430
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,583
The truth is, with everything
that's going on,

431
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,416
I'm in the right frame of
mind to believe just about

432
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,250
anything today. Wait,
if you're standing here,

433
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,666
that means there's
two Miss Asahinas

434
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,166
in the same time plane, right?

435
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,750
Ah. Right.

436
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,416
The past, I mean, the me from
the past, the younger me,

437
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,416
right now, she's eating
lunch in my old classroom

438
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,000
with all her classmates.

439
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,375
There's something important
I had to tell you,

440
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,916
so I pulled some strings and
they finally let me come back

441
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,416
to this time plane again.

442
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,625
If you're wondering,

443
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,708
I asked Miss Nagato
to step out for a bit.

444
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,291
[KYON] Wait, Miss Asahina,
you know about Nagato?

445
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,458
[MIKURU]
Sorry, that's classified.

446
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,166
Wow, it's been forever
since I last said that.

447
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,416
[KYON] Funny, I heard you
say it a coupla days ago.

448
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,791
Ah...

449
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,333
I won't be able to stay
here much longer, so listen,

450
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,041
cause this is important.

451
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,125
Do you know the story
of Snow White?

452
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,666
[KYON]
Uh, yeah, sure I do.

453
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,541
[MIKURU] From now on, if you
ever find yourself in danger,

454
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,375
I want you to remember
those words.

455
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,708
Can you do that?

456
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,833
[KYON] Okay, the seven
dwarves, the wicked witch,

457
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,791
the poison apple,
and all that stuff?

458
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,666
[MIKURU] That's right.
The story about Snow White.

459
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,458
[KYON] Well, if you're talking
about serious danger,

460
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,083
I just had some
of that yesterday.

461
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,375
[MIKURU] That's not the one
I'm talking about. It's worse.

462
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,958
Let's see... I can't
give you any details,

463
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,250
but when the time comes, Miss
Suzumiya should be at your side.

464
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,333
[KYON]
Huh? You mean me and Haruhi?

465
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,958
What's gonna happen?

466
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,833
When it does happen, Miss
Suzumiya probably won't consider

467
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,458
the event to be all that
dangerous. But it will be.

468
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,000
And not just for you and
her, but for all of us,

469
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,416
so just keep that in mind.

470
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,041
Oh, come on, can't you
give me any more details?

471
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,833
Is that classified, too?

472
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,416
[MIKURU] I am sorry, but I
thought that if I at least

473
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,000
gave you a hint...
This is the best I can do...

474
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,541
So that's why you're telling
me about Snow White?

475
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,041
[MIKURU]
Yeah...

476
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,916
Okay, I'll try to remember.

477
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,750
[MIKURU sighs]

478
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,666
[giggles]

479
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,291
[MIKURU] I'm amazed I could
wear something like this.

480
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,208
It's out of the question now.

481
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,208
Well then, can you tell me
what other kinds of outfits

482
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,958
Haruhi made you wear?

483
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,416
That's a secret.
It's just too embarrassing.

484
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,125
Besides, you'll find
out soon enough.

485
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:36,125
Well, I better go...

486
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,375
[KYON gasps]

487
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,625
[MIKURU] Something else
I need to tell you...

488
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,583
Don't get too friendly
with me, okay...?

489
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:46,125
[gasps] Wait, I just
wanna know something!

490
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,666
Miss Asahina, how old
are you right now?

491
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,083
That's classified.

492
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,791
[KYON] That was a smile
that would make anyone

493
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,291
who saw it fall in love.

494
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,458
It's been ages.

495
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,791
[KYON] In other words, the high
school version of Miss Asahina

496
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,041
is gonna return to her
time in the future.

497
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,125
I wonder when that's
gonna happen...?

498
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,000
And how many years between
the one that's in school

499
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,958
with me and the one I just met?

500
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,541
From the way she looked just
now, it could be three or

501
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:19,125
even five years. Women change so
drastically when they graduate

502
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,791
from high school.

503
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,958
Better get back
to the classroom.

504
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,291
Man, I'm really hungry.

505
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,625
Hey, you didn't happen to pass
someone in the hall just now

506
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,833
that looked a lot like
Miss Asahina, did you?

507
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,541
[NAGATO] The Mikuru Asahina
from another time plane,

508
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,125
I met her this morning.

509
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,875
I never asked you before, but
can you time travel like her?

510
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,750
Can that data thing
time travel, too?

511
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,291
I am unable to.

512
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,083
However, time travel is not
that difficult to accomplish.

513
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,291
I'd like some tips
on how to do it.

514
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,291
[NAGATO] Language cannot
explain the concept,

515
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,208
nor are you able
to understand it.

516
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,666
Is that so?

517
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,750
[NAGATO]
It is so.

518
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,083
Then I guess it's my loss.

519
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,833
[NAGATO]
Your loss.

520
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,541
Nagato, thanks again
for yesterday.

521
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,541
Don't thank me. Asakura's
abnormal behavior

522
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:06,041
was my responsibility. I failed.

523
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,125
I really think you look
better without glasses.

524
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,000
[HARUHI]
Where were you?!

525
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,166
I'd thought you'd be back!

526
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,000
I was waiting, and
didn't even eat lunch!

527
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,125
[KYON] Could you say that again,
but like you're an old friend

528
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,958
who's embarrassed and
only acting angry?

529
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,416
[HARUHI] Stop being an idiot
and come with me right now!

530
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,541
I went to the teacher's
lounge and asked Okabe.

531
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,416
Get this: no one
knew that Asakura

532
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,208
was transferring
until this morning.

533
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,500
Apparently, someone claiming
to be her father called in

534
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,625
and said they were moving away!
Just like that!

535
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,083
You wanna know where
they're moving to? Canada!

536
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,625
Can you believe that?!
Something's fishy here.

537
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,041
[KYON]
Ya think?

538
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,791
[HARUHI] There's more!
I asked for their contact info

539
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,541
in Canada. You know
what they told me?

540
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,708
"Sorry, we don't have
that information."

541
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,208
At the very least, you tell
someone your new address!

542
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm sure something
funny's going on!

543
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,041
[KYON]
No, there isn't.

544
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,208
[HARUHI]
I kept up my interrogations

545
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,250
until I got Asakura's
old address.

546
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,166
After school, I'm going
straight over there.

547
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,583
I'll crack this thing wide open!

548
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,708
[KYON] Still the same.
She never listens to anything.

549
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,125
And I won't stop her.
Hey, Haruhi's the one

550
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,875
who's wasting her time
with this, not me.

551
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,166
[HARUHI]
And you're coming, too.

552
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,083
Why me?!

553
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:10,750
[KYON grunts]

554
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,708
Ow!

555
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,458
And you call yourself a member
of the SOS Brigade?!
