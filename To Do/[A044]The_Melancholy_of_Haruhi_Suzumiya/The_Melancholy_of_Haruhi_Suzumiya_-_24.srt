1
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,125
I know of one.

2
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,541
[KYON]
And with that,

3
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,958
Nagato took us to a spot
behind her apartment building.

4
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:34,833
[HARUHI laughs]

5
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,750
[cats meowing]

6
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,708
[HARUHI] Oh, look.
They're not afraid of us.

7
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,833
Let's see, where's a black cat?

8
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,125
[sighs]

9
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,125
Oh, well, then.

10
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,416
This guy's just as good.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,250
[KYON]
She changed the concept again!

12
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,000
He's not exactly a black cat,
but he's better than nothin'!

13
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,166
Okay, Yuki. This is your
brand new familiar.

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,750
I know you'll be good friends.

15
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:08,875
[cat meowing]

16
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,916
[KYON]
We started shooting again.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,708
Looks like it doesn't matter
where we shoot anymore.

18
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,500
Attack Mikuru with
your weird powers!

19
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,458
Accept your fate.

20
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,916
[screams]

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Cut it! That's nice!

22
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,333
Wouldn't it be cool
if the cat could talk?

23
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,666
I mean, he is a
witch's cat, after all.

24
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,833
He should make some
snide remarks or somethin'.

25
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,083
[KYON]
That's absurd!

26
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,583
[HARUHI] I think I'm gonna
call you Shamisen.

27
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,500
Come on, Shamisen,
say something!

28
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,208
[KYON]
He's not gonna talk...

29
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,208
Oh, please, cat! Don't talk!

30
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,958
Wait, "Shamisen"?

31
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,708
We got some good stuff today.

32
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,333
Kyon, you're gonna be
responsible for that cat.

33
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,500
Take him home tonight,

34
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,458
and teach him a
coupla tricks by tomorrow.

35
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,291
Something simple like, I dunno,

36
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,000
like jumping through
a ring of fire!

37
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,166
[sighs]

38
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,583
Well, that's a wrap
for today, everyone!

39
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,250
We're gonna be shootin'
the big climax tomorrow!

40
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,333
The footage looks great,

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,416
and everybody's doin'
an awesome job!

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,958
Get some rest and we'll
hit it hard tomorrow!

43
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:13,125
[hums]

44
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,083
[GROUP sighs]

45
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,208
[KYON chuckles]

46
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,833
Good work today.

47
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,166
I'll go buy you
some cat food later.

48
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,666
Or maybe some dried sardines.

49
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,916
Either one's okay with me.

50
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:32,875
[MIKURU]
Huh?

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,291
Hey, Nagato,
was that you just now?

52
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,333
I was actually
talking to the cat.

53
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,500
Well, you asked me
a question, didn't cha?

54
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,125
That's why I answered.

55
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,541
Did I say something wrong?

56
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,708
Or were ya speakin'
to someone else?

57
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,208
Japanese Bobtail...
Quite the surprise, isn't it?

58
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,125
That's probably the last thing
you should be surprised by.

59
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,666
[MIKURU]
That's amazing!

60
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,583
I never thought
I'd see a talking cat.

61
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,916
[SHAMISEN]
I don't understand why

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,416
everyone here is so
surprised that I'm talking.

63
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,208
[KYON] He's a mutant cat...
No, a cat monster!

64
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,041
But looking at it
from your perspective,

65
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,083
I can see how
the sounds I'm making

66
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,833
might seem like
human speech to you people.

67
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,208
And if that's the case,

68
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,250
how can you be sure that
the sounds coming out of me

69
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,708
mean the same as the words
you think I'm saying?

70
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,583
It might be gibberish, you know?

71
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,416
But the fact that you're
answering my questions

72
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,583
is proof you understand
what I'm saying.

73
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,333
Look, it's possible
that these sounds

74
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,208
only happpen to seem like
answers to your questions.

75
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,625
Just because I reply to you

76
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,000
doesn't mean I know
what I'm talkin' about.

77
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,666
So basically what
you're saying is that

78
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,208
even if two people are talking,

79
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,666
it doesn't mean they're
actually having a conversation.

80
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,833
You know, that's true.

81
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,000
Even if two people
are in a conversation

82
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,375
and believe they
understand each other,

83
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,250
there's no guarantee they're
truly expressing the ideas

84
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,625
behind the words they're using.

85
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,791
He's right.

86
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,791
People can say one thing
and mean another.

87
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,250
[KYON]
Oh, shut up.

88
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,833
The cat does bring up a good
point though, doesn't he?

89
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,041
[KYON]
I'm sorry,

90
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,333
but do you think you
could stop talking, too?

91
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,916
As it stands right now,
the situation is pretty bad.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,208
It seems we've underestimated

93
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,583
Miss Suzumiya's
abilities yet again.

94
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,500
Sorry, I don't
think I understand.

95
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,750
There's a chance
the reality of the movie

96
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,666
might very well become
the new day-to-day

97
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,458
reality of this world.

98
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,458
If Miss Suzumiya
says to herself,

99
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,458
"I'd like to shoot a scene
where a giant meteor crashes,"

100
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,500
it might actually happen.

101
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,958
[MIKURU]
What are we gonna do?

102
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,166
We have to keep her
from using her imagination

103
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,041
from destroying our world.

104
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,125
As it is right now,
she's unconsciously

105
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,833
confusing what's real
with what's not real.

106
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,333
It's hard to stop her
when she's on a roll.

107
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,541
Miss Suzumiya's
strange powers...

108
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,375
...are being filtered and
given life through the world

109
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,083
of the movie she's making.

110
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,333
If we want to prevent
anything bad from happening,

111
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,416
we have to figure out how to

112
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,666
make her accept
that it's all fiction.

113
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,583
Then, we have to help her
turn the story around

114
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,375
into something more reasonable.

115
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,041
That's great, but how
are we gonna explain

116
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,833
a talking cat to her?

117
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,458
I really don't think we should
explain anything to her.

118
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,625
If we did that, we'd find
ourselves in a new reality

119
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,750
where every single cat would
suddenly be able to talk.

120
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,791
But you see, something like that
isn't possible in our world.

121
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,541
What about the fact
that you guys are here?

122
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,791
True.

123
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,125
The three of us wouldn't
be sitting here with you

124
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,875
if it weren't for Miss Suzumiya
and her abilities.

125
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,583
The same goes for
the talking cat.

126
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,375
[KYON] Can't we do
something about this?

127
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,958
[KOIZUMI]
If this were a fantasy world,

128
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,125
you wouldn't need explanations
for all the phenomena around us.

129
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,208
But if we tell her that talking
cats and Mikuru Beams exist,

130
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,708
then the reality of
this world will change.

131
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,875
Do you understand
what that means?

132
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,666
The reality of our current world
would suddenly change.

133
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,291
It would turn into a place where
supernatural phenomena exist

134
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,750
and are the norm.

135
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,500
So what are we gonna do?

136
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,875
We just have to find a suitable
ending to the movie--

137
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,250
One that Miss Suzumiya
will accept, of course.

138
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,791
Sure, if one exists.

139
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,750
Well, actually,
there is one type of ending

140
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,750
that can take
any nonsensical plot

141
00:05:58,833 --> 00:05:59,833
and turn it into something

142
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,500
that makes perfect sense
to an audience.

143
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,875
Well? What is it?

144
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,541
"It was a dream."

145
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,583
No joke, that was the ending
I was talking about.

146
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,625
Do you honestly think
Haruhi's gonna believe that?

147
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,666
I didn't say it
was gonna be easy.

148
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,833
But if she believes it's the
best way to end the movie,

149
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,666
our problems will be solved.

150
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,375
The trick is to pitch
the concept to her,

151
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,958
so that she accepts an ending

152
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,708
where everything is explained
as a dream, a lie, or a mistake.

153
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,958
[KYON] You might think
that's the best solution.

154
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,500
And even I might be inclined
to agree with you on that.

155
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,750
But what's Haruhi gonna say?

156
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,791
[grunts]

157
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:48,583
[KYON]
Here's the deal:

158
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,166
No talking in the house.

159
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,625
You're a cat, and you're
gonna act like a cat, got it?

160
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,208
[SHAMISEN] Not quite sure
what "act like a cat" means,

161
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,250
but if that's what you want,
I'll do my best.

162
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,416
[KYON]
Don't talk!

163
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,166
If you wanna say something,
say "meow."

164
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,541
[SHAMISEN]
Meow.

165
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,125
[giggles]

166
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,250
Kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

167
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,375
[SHAMISEN]
"Meow."

168
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,791
[KYON]
There we go.

169
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,833
Okay, I guess
I'll see you later then.

170
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,083
Yeah, you got it.

171
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,500
[KYON] It was just a few days
before the festival,

172
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,291
and an atmosphere of utter chaos

173
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,750
was slowly spreading

to Haruhi's excitement.

Is everything okay?

197
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,791
It's just... if I say
what I'm about to say,

198
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,708
it might sound like
I don't trust Koizumi.

199
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,333
But, um...
I have to say it anyway.

200
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,541
Uh-huh?

201
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,458
It's just that... Um...

202

I don't think the same as him.

203
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,500
How do I say it?

204
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:42,500
I've got... a different opinion
about things than Koizumi.

205
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,916
Are you talking about his theory

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,708
that Haruhi's a god
or something?

207
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,833
[exhales]

208
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,875
[MIKURU] There's no doubt
that Miss Suzumiya

209
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,166
has the power to alter
the reality of the present.

210
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,583
But I don't think she can change

211
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,958
the actual structure
of this world.

212
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,708
The world has always
been this way.

213
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,416
[KYON]
So what you're saying is that

214
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,916
you believe
the complete opposite

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,041
of what Koizumi told me.

216
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,625
[MIKURU]
I'm pretty sure Miss Nagato

217
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,416
has a different opinion, too.

218
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,458
Um... I know this might give you

219
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,083
a bad impression
of Koizumi as a person.

220
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,208
I'm really sorry, but...

221
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,125
It's just that...

222
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,458
You shouldn't believe
what he says.

223
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,666
Wait! No! I didn't
mean it that way!

224
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,958
Um... I'm sorry!

225
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,625
I'm no good at
explaining things,

226
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,166
and I'm not allowed to say much.

227
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,375
Oh... But still, I--

228
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,291
I think I understand.

229
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,833
You don't think there's any way
Haruhi could be a god.

230
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,666
Your explanation is way easier
to understand than Koizumi's,

231
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,916
that's for sure.

232
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,208
Thank you.

Still, I hope
you understand that

00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,875
I don't have anything
against Koizumi as a person.

235
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,541
I just wanna be clear
about that, okay?

236
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,416
[BOTH chuckle]

237
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,708
This is what Mikuru Asahina
believes to be true:

238
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,458
Haruhi Suzumiya
did not create the world.

239
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,916
The world as it currently exists
has always been this way.

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,083
Psychic powers and time travel,

241
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,958
extraterrestrial life forms
and supernatural beings,

242
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,750
are all tangible
elements within reality.

243
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:21,375
Haruhi Suzumiya's purpose is
to unconsciously discover them.

244
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,291
Her ability to do so activated
approximately three years ago.

245
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,541
She is able to
detect the unusual,

246
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,166
but she can never
recognize their existence.

247
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,333
That is because there
are elements in place

248
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,875
which prevent her from
discovering the truth.

249
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,541
That would be us.

250
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,583
[KYON]
Hm?

251
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,208
Haruhi never notices the weird
things going on around her.

252
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,208
Do Miss Asahina and Koizumi
have different reasons

253
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,000
for keeping her
in the dark like that?

254
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,500
[NAGATO]
Yes.

255
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,333
Miss Asahina was sent by her
superiors to this time plane

256
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,666
to protect the time
plane where she is from.

257
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,708
[KYON] I think she just
said something important,

258
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,625
but she's so casual about it.

259
00:10:56,708 --> 00:11:00,000
[NAGATO] Itsuki Koizumi and
Mikuru Asahina will never agree

260
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,208
on their respective
interpretations.

261
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,875
To them, any theory which
diverges from their own

262
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,666
disrupts the logic
of their theory

263
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,708
and negates their existence.

264
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,291
Hold on!

265
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,958
I remember Koizumi telling me
he didn't get his ESPer powers

266
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,083
until three years ago,
is that true?!

267
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,583
There is no evidence that

268
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,666
what Itsuki Koizumi says
is actually the truth.

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,166
[KYON]
She's right. There's no proof.

270
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,625
Koizumi's theory is just
a convenient explanation

271
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,083
for all the weird stuff
that's happened to me.

272
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,916
So who knows
if that's the truth.

273
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,625
The same goes for
Miss Asahina's theory.

274
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,291
There's no guarantee
her version of things

275
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,875
is the right one either.

276
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,750
[KYON]
What's your opinion about it?

277
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,750
Who's telling the truth?

278
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,875

you were telling me before,

279
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,083
you know, about auto-evolution?

280
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,416
Regardless of which theory
I present you with,

281
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,208
there is no way for you
to determine its truth.

282
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,500
Why not?!

283

There is no guarantee that

284
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,458
what I have been saying
is the truth either.

285
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,333

But who would?!

289
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,833

need to figure out

290
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,708
how to explain this to me,
so I can understand.

The only person who thought
the shoot was going well

292
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,250
was Haruhi.

293
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,500
Of course, this made the gloom

294
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,125
on the faces of Koizumi,
Miss Asahina, and myself

295
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,583
that much gloomier.

00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,875
the toy guns started
firing water bullets

instead of BBs.

300
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,958
Haruhi brought different colored
contacts for Miss Asahina,

301

which made her shoot even
more dangerous things at me.

And each time she did,
Nagato bit her.

for a while now.

to be completely out of whack.

Hi.

316
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,291
It's clear that

about certain details
like plot or foreshadowing.

318

a proper ending
for the film yet.

might end unfinished.

The organization I belong to and

00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,833
There isn't any reason at all;
just making an observation.

347
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,916
It's not important anyway,
and not much fun to discuss.

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,166
You're right about that.

349
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,541
I'm definitely not having fun.

350
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,791
There's something else
you should hear

351
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,666
that won't be fun either.

352
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,958
Have you ever wondered

353
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,625
why Miss Asahina's a part
of our little group?

354
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,458
I mean, the real reason
why she's with us?

355
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,625
Her role in all this is to
entice you over to her side.

356
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,166
The only person I know

357
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,666
who can get Miss Suzumiya to
listen to them is you, isn't it?

358
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,375
You see, that's why
it's so important

359
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,250
to get a hold over you.

360
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,750
With her good looks,
her childish behavior,

361
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,458
and the way she
constantly allows herself

362
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:26,166
to be subjected to Miss
Suzumiya's unreasonable demands,

363
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,625
it's all just
an elaborate scheme

364
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,000
to get your attention, you know?

365
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,500
[KYON sighs]
Getting tired of your jokes now.

366
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,750
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

367
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,541
Oh, I'm sorry.

368
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,750
I guess I don't have the
talent to keep a joke going,

369
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,041
even if I started it.

370
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,791
I was kidding, of course.

371
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,916
Had you going, though.

372
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,708
The pressure of my class play,

373
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,125
along with
Miss Suzumiya's movie,

374
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,458
are starting to get to me.

375
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,083
At least,
that's my interpretation.

376
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,583
And, if closed space were
to appear on top of all that,

377
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,291
I think I'd probably pass out.

378
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,833
In fact, that's the reason for
the request I'm about to make.

379
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,375
Please help.

380
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,250
You have to try to put an end
to all the strange phenomena

381
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,916
that's being caused by
Miss Suzumiya's movie.

382
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,333
Let me get this straight:

383
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,083
You want me to make sure
Haruhi thinks that everything

384
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,666
she's been putting in her movie
is a product of her imagination,

385
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,708
is that right?

386
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,083
Yes, exactly.

387
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,333
It'll only work
if she believes it.

388
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,708
And it has to happen before
we finish shooting the movie.

389
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,833
[KOIZUMI]
All of us are counting on you.

390
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,458
[KYON sighs]

391
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,375
What the heck's with that guy?

392
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,166
He just made me
responsible for everything!

393
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,791
Yeah, but still...

394
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,000
[sighs]

395
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,083
I guess I can't just ignore it.

396
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,333
God, this is so annoying!

397
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,125
A movie's a movie,
and reality's reality.

398
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,250
They're two totally
different things.

399
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,500
It's pretty obvious.

400
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,291
So why is it up to me
to convince her of it?

401
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,541
Koizumi said the movie
has to be a dream,

402
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,000
but there's gotta
be another way.

403
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,291
Huh?

404
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,458
[KYON]
The next day, I cornered Haruhi

405
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,666
and pitched the concept
I had in mind.

406
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,041
Then after discussing it,
she agreed.

407
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,000
[HARUHI]
Okay! Cut!

408
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,541
Great job, guys!

409
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,416
We're only a couple shots
away from finishing this thing.

410
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,750
Everyone's been great,
I mean it!

411
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,083
Let's meet in the club room
first thing tomorrow morning

412
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,333
for a sneak preview!

413
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,125
[MIKURU cries]

414
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,791
[HARUHI]
Oh, Mikuru! Why are you crying?!

415
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,166
Save those tears of yours for

416
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,708
when you get the Palme d'Or
and the Oscar!

417
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,833
We should all be happy
we made this together!

418
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,083
[nervous laugh]

419
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,625
[KYON] The final battle
between Mikuru and Yuki

420
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,000
awakens Itsuki Koizumi's powers.

421
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,916
And this deus ex machina power
that no one understands

422
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,916
knocks Yuki out into space!

423
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,291
With that, the curtain
lowers on our story.

424
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,041
The end!

425
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,041
[KOIZUMI]
Looks like it's finally over.

426
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,166
[laughs]

427
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,583
But now that we're done,

428
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,000
it feels like it ended
rather quickly, doesn't it?

429
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,166
You know that old saying,

430
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,375
"Time flies when
you're having fun"?

431
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,583
Although in our case,
I wonder who was having fun.

432
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,708
Beats me.

433
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,958
[chuckles]

434
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,375
I hope it won't be
too much trouble

435
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,666
if I leave the rest
for you to handle.

436
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't stop thinkin'
about that play I'm in.

437
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,041
Unlike a movie, if I'm up on
stage and I mess up a line,

438
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,791
there are no second takes.

439
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,333
Oh, there's one more thing.

440
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,708
My organization's very grateful.

441
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,500
They thank you.

442
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,333
And I thank you, too.

443
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,000
[HARUHI]
Okay! Shout it loud!

444
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,791
Our movie's gonna be
a Hollywood blockbuster!

445
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,541
We'll win the Golden Bear
and a Gold Lion at Cannes!

446
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,875
[HARUHI]
That was great!

447
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,500
Now, point to the future!

448
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,708
Oh, brother...

449
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,416
[MIKURU]
Okay...

450
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,166
[KYON] To tell you the truth,
up until the very end,

451
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,791
I didn't have a pixel of an
idea what kind of movie

452
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,291
Haruhi was actually
trying to make.

453
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,833
And I bet you already knew this,

454
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,416
but there wasn't enough time
to finish the visual effects.

455
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,625
Not that I was capable of

456
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,625
doing stuff like that
in the first place.

457
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,208
[KYON]
And Haruhi didn't like that.

458
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,583
We can't show this picture
until all the effects are done,

459
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,916
so it's up to you!

460
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,125
Now figure it out!

461
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,791
But the festival's tomorrow.

462
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,375
I'm running on fumes here!

463
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,791
You can make the deadline
if you work through the night.

464
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,166
Pull an all-nighter
if you have to.

465
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,208
I'm gonna stay too
and help you out.

466
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,333
[KYON]
When all was said and done,

467
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,583
Haruhi wasn't much help at all.

468
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,708
[sighs]

469
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,750
[gasps]

470
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,250
[KYON]
Huh?

471
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,208
[growls]

472
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,375
[KYON]
To be perfectly fair though,

473
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,666
I sorta fell asleep, too.

474
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,125
[HARUHI]
Kyon.

475
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,000
Kyon! Come on! Wake up!

476
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,333
[KYON yells]

477
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
[groans]

478
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,416
So? How did it turn out?

479
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,666
[KYON] There wasn't any point
staying overnight.

480
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,125
The thing still isn't finished.

481
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,916
[MIKURU]
...from the future!

482
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,791
[music playing]

483
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,458
Wow!

484
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,666
[KYON]
Huh?

485
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,666
[MIKURU yells]

486
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,916
[HARUHI]
I'm surprised.

487
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,458
Considering you did all
the effects last minute,

488
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,875
it's pretty good!

489
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,833
[KYON]
It wasn't me.

490
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,583
Someone else must've done it.

491
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,125
Odds are, Nagato.

492
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,583
Next, Koizumi.

493
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,291
Miss Asahina? Doubt it.

494
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,875
Or, it could've been someone
who hasn't shown up yet.

495
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,500
There's a scary thought.

496
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,125
Good morning.
How'd it turn out?

497
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,625
I hope you didn't
stay up too late.

498
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,666
Good morning, everyone.

499
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,083
[HARUHI]
Good morning, guys!

500
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,125
Guess what we have to show you?

501
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,916
Made with blood,
sweat, and tears,

502
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,666
it's a full-blown spectacle!

503
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,625
[MIKURU]
Wow! You finished it!

504
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,333
That's wonderful, really!

505
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,791
[HARUHI chuckles]

506
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,291
Now, it's time for us
to watch it together!

507
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,583
Aw, Mikuru! You were so awesome!

508
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,875
I bet you're gonna have
a lotta fans from this!

509
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,750
They're gonna eat you up!

510
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,666
[KYON]
The arts festival had begun.

511
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,958
And there was
nothing more for me to do.

512
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,958
All the fears we had
of our reality changing

513
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,625
have disappeared.

514
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,583
I knew that for a fact because
Shamisen stopped talking.

515
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,666
[KYON]
Oh, yeah... That reminds me.

516
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,500
It had been a while since
I'd seen all those guys

517
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,791
who were dressed kinda strange.

518
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,166
I don't think they were
in any of the plays

519
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,916
the other classes
were putting on.

520
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,166
Who the heck were they, anyway?

521
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:48,041
[KYON] The movie ended with
a bit of narration by Haruhi.

522
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,458
I convinced her it would be cool

523
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,125
if she gave a speech about
how the story wasn't real,

524
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,291
that it was all
supposed to be fun.

525
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,625
Those were the magic words

526
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,458
that cancelled out
everything that happened.

527
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,583
[HARUHI] ...are fictional
as well. It's all made up.

528
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,083
Even if it resembles someone,

529
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,041
it's probably
just a coincidence.

530
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,833
Oh! Except for the commercials.

531
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,791
Shop at Ohmori Electronics
and Yamatsuchi's Model Shop

532
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,083
for great deals!

533
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,833
Stop by and buy!

534
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,291
Huh? I gotta say it again?

535
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,750
This story is a work of fiction.

536
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,750
All character names,
organizations, incidents,

537
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,166
and any other names--

538
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,250
Hey, Kyon! Why do I have
to say all this stuff anyway?

539
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,250
I mean, it's totally obvious!

540
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,458
[KYON]
It might not seem like

541
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,750
anything ever gets
under Haruhi's skin,

542
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:30,833
but the truth is,

543
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,625
there's one thing
that bothers her--

544
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,250
The world's too normal.

545
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,666
Now, you're probably wondering
what a person like her

546
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,541
would consider "not normal."

547
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,583
The answer is: the supernatural.

548
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,416
For example, she'd say,

549
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,958
"Why haven't I seen a ghost yet?
What's up with that?"

550
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,666
It's something I'm sure
is always on her mind.

551
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,791
I've got something really
important to tell you.

552
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,125
Okay.

553
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,875
A while ago, you said you
wanted to hang out with

554
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,833
aliens, time travelers,
and ESPers.

555
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,208
Are you still into those things?

556
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,250
Yeah, I am.

557
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,208
But why are you
bringing that up?

558
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,541
Because I know for a fact

559
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,791
that aliens, time travelers,
and ESPers are real,

560
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,458
and they're even closer
than you think.

561
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,125
[HARUHI]
Hm?

562
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,375
Really? Closer than I think?

563
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,958
Well, the only people
I can think of

564
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:17,000
who'd fit that description would
be Yuki, Mikuru, and Koizumi.

565
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,291
I mean, could there be anyone
closer to me than those guys?

566
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,833
Actually...

567
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,666
That's pretty much exactly
what I was gonna tell you.

568
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,041
What?! Are you crazy
or something?

569
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,291
Do you honestly think

570
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,541
I'd believe something
as convenient as that?

571
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,416
[KYON] Well, normally,
that would be true...

572
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,625
[HARUHI]
Okay then, fine.

573
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:42,541
Who's who?

574
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,833
[KYON]
You're gonna love this.

575
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,833
Yuki Nagato is an alien.

576
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,583
She's with the Data Integration
Entity or... something.

577
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:51,583
Anyway, she's like an agent
for this entity thing.

578
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,375
Uh--Oh yeah!
Humanoid interface,

579
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,833
that's what
she said she was.

580
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,833
[HARUHI scoffs]
Really? How 'bout Mikuru?

581
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,958
[KYON] Miss Asahina's
a little easier to explain.

582
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:00,833
Here goes:

583
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,166
She's a time traveler.

584
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,541
She's from the future
and travels through time,

585
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,875
a time traveler.

586
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,458
[HARUHI]
What time is she from?

587
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:11,458
[KYON] I don't know, she won't
tell me, says it's "classified."

588
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,541
[chuckles]

589
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,666
Uh-huh. I think I got it.

590
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,916
So, you believe me then.

591
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,291
Next, you're probably
gonna tell me

592
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,625
Koizumi's the ESPer
in the group.

593
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,333
Am I right or am I right?

594
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,250
Yeah! That's exactly what
I was gonna say to you next!

595
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,625
[HARUHI]
Mm-hmm.

596
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,916
[KYON]
Mm-hmm.

597
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,458
[HARUHI]
Hm.

598
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,208
[KYON]
Hm.

599
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:29,250
[HARUHI]
Hm...

600
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,166
[KYON sighs]

601
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,125
[HARUHI]
Hm...

602
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,166
[KYON]
Hm...?

603
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,541
Don't mess with me!

604
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,750
Hmph.

605
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,791
[KYON]
What a nut!

606
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,708
She picks the weirdest things
to get all rational about.

607
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,416
[KYON] Everything would
be so much easier if,

608
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,750
for once, she would
just believe me!

609
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,791
[SERVER]
Hey, thanks! Come again!

610
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,208
[KYON]
But, it's probably for the best.

611
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,791
If Haruhi ever found out about

612
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:01,458
all the strange phenomena
happening around her,

613
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,208
we'd all be in big trouble.

614
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,625
Oh, brother...
