1
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,000
[KYON] Well, it's been about a
month since we started school,

2
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,833
and I've been enjoying
my early morning hikes

3
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,541
about as much as I could.

4
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,625
Although, I sort of
feel like Sisyphus,

5
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,083
cursed to forever roll
that boulder up the hill,

6
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,833
tryin' to make it to the top.

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,458
And then something hit me.

8
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,708
Something that felt
like an 8.0 earthquake,

9
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,541
which brought my normal
life to a grinding halt.

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,708
[KYON]
No, that's not quite right.

11
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,041
Actually, something
was starting to happen.

12
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,541
[HARUHI] If it doesn't exist,
I should just make it myself!

13
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,916
Make a club!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,125
And you're gonna
help me with it!

15
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,041
I've just figured out what
we're gonna call ourselves!

16
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,416
The SOS Brigade!

17
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,833
[KYON] And so begins
my never-ending hell,

18
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,958
thanks to the eccentric
Haruhi Suzumiya.

19
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,958
[ASAKURA]
Good morning!

20
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,458
Uh... Oh, morning.

21
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,250
[ASAKURA] I forgot I had
class duties today.

22
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,291
I have to get the class log
from the teacher's lounge.

23
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,333
I have to hurry!
I'll see you in class!

24
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,750
[KYON] Hard to believe
a girl like that's

25
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,833
in my class along with...

26
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,041
Hmm?

27
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,083
[HARUHI] Hey, Kyon! Can you
think of anything else

28
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,333
we're gonna need right now?

29
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,791
What do you mean?

30
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,875
I wanna get my hands on a
mysterious transfer student.

31
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,250
What d'you think of that?

32
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,416
I beg you, please start the
conversation by making

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,750
the context clear.

34
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,833
It's exactly what
the SOS Brigade needs.

35
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,583
We need something like a
mysterious transfer student.

36
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,375
Okay, before you
kidnap anyone else,

37
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:51,916
what do you mean
by "mysterious"?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,958
Check it out: school started
less than two months ago, right?

39
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,041
So I'm thinking that
anybody who transfers

40
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,541
into our school right now has
to be mysterious! Am I right?

41
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,041
Maybe the kid's dad got
relocated because of work.

42
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,250
[HARUHI] Oh, work with me here.
It's not normal!

43
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,291
I'd sorta like to know what
you consider normal,

44
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,791
but I'm almost afraid to ask.

45
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,250
[HARUHI] Hmm... I wonder if
we'll get anyone like that.

46
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,958
A mysterious transfer student...

47
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,875
[sighs] I guess in other words,

48
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,708
you don't really give a damn
about anything I say at all.

49
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,250
Whatever...

50
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,458
[KYON] Apparently there's a
rumor floating around school

51
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,958
that Haruhi and I
are up to something.

52
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,916
Level with me. What are
you and Suzumiya up to?

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,666
You guys wouldn't happen to be
dating or anything, would you?

54
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,333
Ugh, no, we're not dating.

55
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,250
And trust me, I'd also
like to know what we're

56
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,500
supposedly up to.

57
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,708
I don't have any idea
what I'm doing anymore.

58
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,000
Just don't overdo it. You're
not in junior high anymore.

59
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,708
You guys mess up the
school or anything,

60
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:17,083
you'll get suspended
at the very least.

61
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,875
[KYON] At least I can keep Yuki
Nagato and Mikuru Asahina

62
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,500
from getting involved in
anything too crazy.

63
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,958
[KYON] Since the
SOS Brigade was founded,

64
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,458
the once empty room of
the former literary club

65
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,041
now has lots of things in it.

66
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,458
Maybe she's planning on
living here or something.

67
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:38,750
You know what? It'd be great
to have a computer in here!

68
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,458
We're living in
the information age

69
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,375
and we don't even have a
computer. I can't forgive them.

70
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,208
[KYON] And who is it
you can't forgive?

71
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,958
What d'ya say? Let's go get one!

72
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,125
Do you have any idea
how we're gonna get one?

73
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,208
You're not gonna rob
a computer store, are you?

74
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,625
No way! We're gonna
hit someplace closer.

75
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,250
Hi, everyone!

76
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,541
I've come for a computer

77
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:03,791
and all the accessories
that go with it!

78
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,166
Who in here's the president?

79
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,416
I guess that'd be me?

80
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,333
There's only one reason
why I would schlep

81
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,500
all the way over here
to the computer club.

82
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,083
I'm here for a computer!

83
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,125
I only need one.

84
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,208
Excuse me?
You crazy or somethin'?

85
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,333
We only need one, and you guys
got a whole bunch in here.

86
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,875
Hang on a sec,
who the heck are you anyway?

87
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,458
We are the SOS Brigade, and I'm
Haruhi Suzumiya, the leader!

88
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,916
And these are my henchmen
Number 1 and Number 2!

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,375
[sighs]

90
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,541
Don't give me any crap.
Just hand over a computer

91
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,583
and no one gets hurt.

92
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,916
Why the hell should I?!

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,958
I'm not givin'
you guys anything!

94
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,583
[HARUHI]
Hmm...

95
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,041
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Hmm?

96
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,291
Okay. Here's how this is
gonna go down, boys,

97
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,375
so try to pay attention.

98
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,875
[hums]

99
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,833
[whimpers]

100
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,208
[gasps]

101
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,041
[screams]

102
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,791
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
What're you doing?!

103
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,791
[grunts]

104
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,250
And! One more shot!

105
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,375
[screams]

106
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,541
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
What're you doing?!

107
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,333
[HARUHI]
Ah-ah-ah!

108
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:12,000
I have photographic evidence
of blatant sexual harassment.

109
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,000
If you don't want any
of these pics to show up

110
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,875
all over campus, hand over a
computer and be quick about it.

111
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,583
This is ludicrous! You forced
me to touched her breasts!

112
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,416
I'm innocent I tell ya!

113
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,041
Wonder how many people
are gonna listen to

114
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:27,083
your side of the story,
you sexual harasser.

115
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,666
What?! Hang on! All the club
members here are witnesses!

116
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,291
That's right!

117
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,166
[MEMBER B]
Yeah, it wasn't his fault!

118
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,500
Then I'll tell everyone at
school that all you geeks

119
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,291
ganged up on her and ----ed her!

120
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,333
[gasping]

121
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,750
You out of her mind
or something?!

122
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,833
Well, chief?

123
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,416
You gonna hand it over or not?

124
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
M-Miss Suzumiya...

125
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,041
That's--!

126
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,958
[growls]

127
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,791
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Take whichever one you want.

128
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,500
[HARUHI]
Hmm.

129
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,750
Get up, man!

130
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,333
[MEMBER B]
Get a hold of yourself.

131
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,458
It's gonna be okay.

132
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,458
[MEMBER C]
We'll figure this out, sir.

133
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,875
[MEMBER B]
Don't cry.

134
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,708
[KYON] It's... like a bad
comedy skit or something.

135
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,541
Which one's the latest model?

136
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,125
Give me one good reason
why I should tell you that!

137
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,083
[HARUHI]
Hmm!

138
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,625
[whimpers]

139
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,125
[sighs]

140
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,000
[HARUHI]
That one...

141
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,541
[gasping]

142
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,375
I almost forgot....
I got a list from the list

143
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,708
from the computer
store yesterday.

144
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,500
It's got all the
newest models on it.

145
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,750
[gasping]

146
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,291
And, it looks like this
computer's not listed.

147
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:30,875
Uh...

148
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,291
[HARUHI]
Hm...

149
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,416
[gasping]

150
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,625
Think I'll take that one!

151
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,833
[gasping]

152
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:37,833
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Wait, that's the machine

153
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,750
we just bought!
You can't do this!

154
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,083
[gasps]

155
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,125
Take it, you thief...

156
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,625
[KYON]
Yeah, you got that right...

157
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,041
She is a thief.

158
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,458
[HARUHI]
Hey, Kyon!

159
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,125
[KYON]
Hmm?

160
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,750
Could you get this?

161
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,250
[KYON] And, just like that,
Haruhi procured

162
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,416
a state-of-the-art computer.

163
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,833
It was only then she learned
that the literary club

164
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,708
wasn't wired for internet use.

165
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,291
So she called the Computer Club
over to run a LAN cable

166
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,666
between our rooms.

167
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,791
She also had them set us up
so that we could connect

168
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,458
using the school's domain.

169
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,958
Can you say "Extortion"?

170
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,291
Good.

171
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,875
Come on, what d'ya say we
go back to the others?

172
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:21,000
[MIKURU whimpers]

173
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,875
Miss Asahina, I was
thinking maybe it's best

174
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,000
you don't get involved
with this brigade thing.

175
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:31,541
I mean, who knows what she'll
end up doing to you if you stay?

176
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,000
No, it's all right I guess.

177
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,083
But you'll stay too, won't you?

178
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,625
Uh...

179
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,875
I guess the probability
of this happening

180
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,458
on this particular time
plane's is unavoidable.

181
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,500
Huh...?

182
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,791
And I'm worried about why
Miss Nagato's here, too...

183
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:55,750
What'd you say?

184
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,000
Huh?

185
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,250
Oh, nothing.
I was just babbling.

186
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,916
I might be a little
inexperienced, but I know

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,541
I'm gonna get along
with everyone here.

188
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,875
By the way, you don't have to be
so formal.

189
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,125
Please just call me Mikuru
if you don't mind.

190
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,416
[KYON]
Okay...

191
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,333
So what's next...?

192
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,250
[KYON] So, about this website,
who're you gonna get to make it?

193
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,625
That'd be you.

194
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,916
Beats sitting around
being bored all the time.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,250
I have to go out and find
some more members now.

196
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,833
Oh, and make sure
you finish the site

197
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:33,166
in the next couple of days.
The club's dead in the water

198
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,541
until we have our
site up and running.

199
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,041
[sighs]

200
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,916
I'm building a website, huh?

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,083
[KYON] Despite my griping,
I kinda enjoyed making it.

202
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,666
The guys from the
Computer Club installed

203
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,333
all the software for me, so it
wasn't too hard to figure out.

204
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,791
Not a bad way to spend
an otherwise boring lunch.

205
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,541
Okay. What am I supposed
to put on it?

206
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:01,291
I mean, I still had absolutely
no idea what the SOS Brigade

207
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,708
was actually going to do.

208
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,000
Hey, Nagato, was there anything

209
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,708
you wanted me to
put on this site?

210
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,291
No, there's not.

211
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,375
[KYON] Not that I should
get involved, but...

212
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,583
...does this girl
even go to class?

213
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:21,916
[birds chirping]

214
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,125
[school bell chimes]

215
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:27,583
[KYON snores]

216
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:33,583
Uh. Oh crap!
I gotta go to class!

217
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,375
[KYON]
Huh...?

218
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,458
Take it...

219
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,750
I'll lend this to you...

220
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,791
Uh...

221
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,166
[door closes]

222
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,833
[KYON] Okay, I'm still not sold
on this whole "Brigade" thing.

223
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,666
So why do I find myself eagerly
commuting to the club room?

224
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,291
Why? Is it simply
what you call "habit"?

225
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,666
[KYON]
Hey!

226
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,583
[KYON] These two can't
be that bored, can they?

227
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,583
Can't say I'm not
bored either, but...

228
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,375
Where's Miss Suzumiya?

229
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,000
Dunno. By the time I managed
to get to our 6th period class,

230
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,333
she wasn't there.

231
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,041
How much you wanna bet
she's out there right now

232
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,958
extorting more gear
from somebody?

233
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,000
Will I be forced to do
something like yesterday?

234
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,833
You'll be fine, trust me.

235
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,833
I'm not gonna let anything like
that happen to you ever again.

236
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,291
You mean you'll protect me?!

237
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,916
Oh, thank you so much!

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,666
Guess I'll be counting
on you, then!

239
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,666
It's an honor to be counted on.

240
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,166
[HARUHI]
Ya-hoo!

241
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,291
[KYON]
Ya... hoo?

242
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,500
[grunts]

243
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,500
[BOTH gasp]

244
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,541
First, take a look at this!

245
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,291
"SOS Brigade... an explanation
of our general policies..."

246
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,791
And now, for this:

247
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,791
Ta-da-da-da, da-da!

248
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,041
We're gonna pass out
flyers wearing these.

249
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,250
[KYON]
Where at?

250
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,750
The main gate.

251
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,541
There's a bunch of students
still hanging out on campus.

252
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,166
[KYON]
And what exactly are we wearing?

253
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,791
You're not the one wearing it.

254
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,291
I got this outfit for Mikuru.

255
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,541
Ah! What?

256
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,166
A bunny girl costume.

257
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,916
But... how... how am
I supposed to...?

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,750
[HARUHI]
Come on! Put it on! Get dressed!

259
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,041
[MIKURU]
But I don't want to!

260
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,708
[HARUHI] Shut up and strip!
Come on, girl!

261
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,833
[MIKURU]
Nooo!

262
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,083
Hey, Suzumiya! Stop it!

263
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,916
Please, no! No, don't look!

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,666
[gasps]

265
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,708
[HARUHI]
Quit struggling!

266
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,541
[MIKURU]
But I don't wanna put it on!

267
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,916
[HARUHI] Move your arm!
Let's go, Mikuru, take it off!

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,875
Take it off!

269
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,166
[screaming]

270
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,625
[sighs]

271
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,875
[MIKURU]
Noo... don't...

272
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,208
[GIRLS]
Let's go! Let's go!

273
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,291
[MIKURU]
Let me take it off myself!

274
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,250
No! Noo!

275
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,541
[HARUHI]
You can come in now!

276
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,708
[KYON]
She's like an evil overlord.

277
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,708
Well? Think we'll get some
attention now or what?

278
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,500
[KYON] Don't think
that'll be a problem.

279
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,041
Nagato wasn't into it?

280
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,125
[HARUHI] Nah, I could
only afford two of 'em.

281
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,750
I got the deluxe set,
so they were expensive.

282
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,416
[KYON]
Where'd you buy these things...?

283
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,083
[HARUHI]
I got 'em online.

284
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,500
[KYON]
I see.

285
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,416
[HARUHI]
Well, we'll be going now.

286
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,416
Come on, Mikuru, let's head out.

287
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,958
No, I don't wanna...

288
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,750
Nooo!

289
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,625
[HARUHI]
Let's go! Yeah!

290
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,833
[whimpers]

291
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,250
[KYON]
Sorry...

292
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,833
Honestly though, that outfit's
killing me right now.

293
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,750
My passion's going
through the roof here...

294
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,291
[KYON]
Hmm?

295
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,041
[gasps]

296
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,750
[sighs]

297
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:49,916
[KYON]
Oh brother...

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,125
It's still warm from
their body heat...

299
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,500
[KYON]
"The SOS Brigade:

An explanation of our
general policies.

We, the SOS Brigade, are
committed to seeking out

mysteries in this universe.

experienced strange phenomena

We only accept phenomena and/or
mysteries that freak us out!

Please keep that in mind."

312
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,541
[KYON] I think I'm starting
to understand the reason

313
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,791
for this brigade's existence.

314
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,333
They piss me off so much!

315
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,208
I mean, what's with
those stupid teachers?!

316
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,750
They're always butting in!

317
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,625
So what happened out there?
Did you guys get into trouble?

318
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,333
Unbelievable! We passed
out half our flyers

319
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,791
and teachers came out of
nowhere telling us to stop!

320
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,458
Who do they think they are?!

321
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,958
[KYON] If two girls
in bunny suits

322
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,041
are passing out flyers
in front of the school,

323
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,291
everybody'd come running
to check that out.

324
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,166
[HARUHI] Mikuru starts sobbing,
I get yanked into detention,

325
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,333
and Okabe, that handball
freak, comes over-- Augh!

326
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,541
[KYON]
I'm sure they didn't know

327
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,583
what to keep their
eyes focused on.

328
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,625
Well, I guess that's
it for today.

329
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,666
Dismissed!

330
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,958
[gasps]

331
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,541
[HARUHI]
How long you gonna cry anyway?!

332
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,916
Let's go! Take it off, come on!

333
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,000
Um, say, Kyon...

334
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,333
If I find I'm unable to get
married after all this,

335
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,875
would you be willing
to marry me...?

336
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,166
[KYON]
What should I say?

337
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,541
Miss Asahina, you look
like you just found out

338
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,583
you didn't get accepted
into college.

339
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,666
Or, like someone
who's just lost her job

340
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,458
the day after buying
her dream house.

341
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:54,125
Wait... Oh man, now you're
calling me Kyon, too...

342
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,750
By the next day, the name Haruhi
Suzumiya had become infamous.

343
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,458
Now everyone at school
was talking about her.

344
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,125
Hey there, Kyon,
hate to say it,

345
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,791
but it looks like you've
gone and done it.

346
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,750
You've become one of Suzumiya's
gang of weirdos, huh?

347
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,250
Oh, shut up.

348
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,291
[KYON] The sucky thing about
being part of all this

349
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,250
is that my name and
Miss Asahina's are now

350
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,875
floating around the campus, too.

351
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,208
I couldn't believe what
I was seeing yesterday.

352
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,000
A couple of bunny girls hanging
out by the school's main gate.

353
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,291
I mean, the girl in red was
Mikuru Asahina, wasn't it?

354
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,166
Now everybody in school's
talking about you guys, Kyon.

355
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,375
Everybody.

356
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,166
[ASAKURA] What exactly
is this SOS Brigade?

357
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,916
You're gonna have
to ask Suzumiya.

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,291
I really don't know.
I don't even wanna know.

359
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,250
Well, it definitely
looks like you guys

360
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,666
are having a lot of fun.

361
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,291
But you know, yesterday's stunt
was a little overboard.

362
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,666
[KYON] That day Miss Asahina
didn't show up to school.

363
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,291
Unbelievable. Not a single email
after all that publicity!

364
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,125
[KYON] After publicity like
that, I don't think anyone's

365
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,833
gonna want anything
to do with us.

366
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,708
Have to admit though, that stunt
caught everyone's attention.

367
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,041
Hang on... Where's Mikuru?

368
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,416
Didn't she come to school?

369
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,375
[KYON]
She might never show up again.

370
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,500
Hope she wasn't too
traumatized by all this...

371
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,791
And I even got a new outfit
for her to wear today, too.

372
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,375
Why don't you wear
it yourself then?

373
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,375
[HARUHI] Oh, don't worry,
I'm gonna wear it.

374
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,458
It's just not any fun
if Mikuru isn't here...

375
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,208
[KYON] Why don't you
have Nagato wear it?

376
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,041
I doubt she'd have
any complaints.

377
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:23,041
In fact, I don't think I'd
mind seeing her wear it.

378
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,625
Agh!

379
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,750
I got the SOS Brigade
up and running,

380
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,208
and now we're just
sitting around.

381
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,958
What is it, everybody holding
out on me or something?

382
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,208
Keeping their mysteries
to themselves...

383
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,916
[KYON] Okay, Haruhi.
Look, ask anybody in this room

384
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,625
and they'd say, "Sure,
mysteries? Why not?"

385
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,958
But an ordinary high school like
ours isn't gonna have a bunch

386
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,041
of weirdness just stacked in the
corner somewhere for you.

387
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,500
You know that, right?

388
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,916
I mean, you do realize
that, don't you?

389
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,333
You don't have any place
to channel all that

390
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,166
adolescent frustration
boiling inside you.

391
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,083
Isn't that what's really fueling
all this impulsive behavior?

392
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,916
Snap out of it and go find
yourself a good-looking guy

393
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,750
and let him walk you
home from school.

394
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,625
Heck, go see a movie with him
on Sunday or something.

395
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,291
Or, why don't you try sports?

396
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,166
Get on one of the teams and give
'em hell out on the field.

397
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sure you'll make the
starting line up on any

398
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:09,916
varsity team you pick.

399
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,208
[HARUHI]
I'm going home.

400
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,958
[KYON sighs]

401
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,041
[KYON]
Well, guess I'll head out, too.

402
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,083
[YUKI]
Did you read it...?

403
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,208
[KYON]
What?

404
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,833
Book...

405
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,125
Oh, no I haven't yet.

406
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,916
Do you want me to
give it back to you?

407
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,708
That will not be necessary...

408
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,208
[KYON] When Yuki does talk,
she has a tendency to avoid

409
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,041
the pitfalls of idle
conversation.

410
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,666
Please read it today...

411
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,541
[KYON]
Hmm?

412
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,500
As soon as you get home...

413
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,625
All right, I will.

414
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,125
[KYON'S SISTER] Huh!
Where're you going now, Kyon?

415
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,416
[KYON] I'm meeting with
someone at the station,

416
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,416
and don't talk with
your mouth full.

417
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,916
I'm sorry... Was today the day?

418
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,583
You weren't waiting for me here
last night as well, were you?

419
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,791
Well, why'd you pick
this place to meet up?

420
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,333
Follow me...

421
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,583
So, uh... Where're your folks?

422
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,208
They're not here...

423
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,833
Uh... Yeah, I know they're
not here right now, but,

424
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,833
did they go somewhere?

425
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,791
Actually, I am the only
one who is ever here...

426
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,875
You live by yourself?

427
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,833
Yes...

428
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,541
So what is it you wanted
to see me about?

429
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,375
Drink it...

430
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,541
[KYON slurps]

431
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,541
Is it good?

432
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,958
Yeah, thanks.

433
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,458
[KYON slurps]

434
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,958
[groans]

435
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:57,375
[KYON gulps]

436
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,416
[KYON sighs]
I'm gonna explode...

437
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,416
Okay... You think it's about
time you got around to tell

438
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,500
why you wanted me to come
all the way out here?

439
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,708
Were you uncomfortable
talking to me at school

440
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,416
about it or something?

441
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,000
It's about Haruhi Suzumiya.

442
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:25,250
And, in addition,
it is about myself...

443
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:29,708
That is what I would
like to talk about.

444
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,041
Okay... You and Suzumiya.
So what's up?

445
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,250
It is difficult to find
the words...

446
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:43,083
There might be discrepancies
in the transmission of data.

447
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,000
However, please listen...

448
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,791
Haruhi Suzumiya and I are
not ordinary human beings...

449
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,750
Yeah, I already sorta figured
out that you two

450
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:54,750
weren't exactly normal.

451
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,791
That's not what I mean...

452
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:02,375
I am not referring to the
absence of universally accepted

453
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,000
personality traits.

454
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,416
What I mean is literal, in that
she and I are not the same

455
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,250
as ordinary human beings.

456
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,750
Human beings such as yourself.

457
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,166
I have been created by the data
integration thought entity

458
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,166
that supervises this galaxy.

459
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,458
I am a humanoid interface
designed to make contact with

460
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:25,250
organic lifeforms like you.
Do you understand?

461
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,625
Huh...?

462
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,333
To use a common term that is
applicable to this situation,

463
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,291
I believe I would be
classified as an alien.

464
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,416
[KYON]
An... alien.
