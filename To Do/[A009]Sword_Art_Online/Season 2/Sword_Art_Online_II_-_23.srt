00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,587
OR MAYBE SELL IT.

172
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,921
Asuna: NO WAY.

173
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,840
Yuuki: THAT'S WHY
I WANTED TO COME HERE,

174
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,550
SO I COULD SEE IT
ONE MORE TIME.

175
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,552
Asuna: WELL, I KNOW
HOW YOU CAN SAVE IT.

176
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,970
Yuuki: HOW?

177
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,847
Asuna: YOU'RE FIFTEEN NOW,
AREN'T YOU?

178
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,265
WHEN YOU TURN SIXTEEN,

179
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,059
FIND SOMEONE YOU LOVE,
AND MARRY 'EM!

180
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,560
THAT WAY,
YOU'LL HAVE SOMEONE AROUND

181
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,979
WHO'LL KEEP THIS HOUSE
FROM EVER BEING TORN DOWN.

182
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,981
Yuuki: (LAUGHS)

183
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,150
YOU GOT THE CRAZIEST IDEAS!

184
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,777
(SIGHS)

185
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,446
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE
I WANNA MARRY, THOUGH.

186
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,657
Asuna: OH, YEAH? BUT YOU AND JUN
MAKE A CUTE COUPLE.

187
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,659
Yuuki: GOD, NO!
THAT GUY'S SO IMMATURE.

188
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,952
Asuna: (LAUGHS)

189
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,372
Yuuki: LET'S SEE.
WHO SHOULD I MARRY?

190
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,665
OH, I KNOW!

191
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,958
‐ YOU!
‐ Asuna: HUH?

192
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,835
Yuuki: THE ONLY THING IS,
IF YOU MARRY ME,

193
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,462
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE THE WIFE.

194
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,047
I MEAN, THE OTHER WAY AROUND,

195
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,382
MY NAME'D BE YUUKI YUUKI,
AND THAT'D BE WEIRD.

196
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,842
(LAUGHS)

197
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,428
Asuna: I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT MY MOM WOULD SAY.

198
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,888
Yuuki: I KNOW. I'M KIDDING.

199
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,682
'SIDES, YOU ALREADY
GOT SOMEONE LINED UP.

200
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,352
Asuna: OH, WELL, YEAH. I GUESS.

201
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,354
Yuuki: STILL,
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.

202
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,730
I GET THE FEELING

203
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,774
HE'S NOT LIVING
IN THE REAL WORLD, EITHER.

204
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,317
NOT LIKE ME, BUT YOU KNOW.

205
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,027
Asuna: (CHUCKLES)

206
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,279
Yuuki: I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH, ASUNA.

207
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,615
JUST TO SEE MY OLD HOUSE AGAIN,

208
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,243
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW HAPPY THAT MAKES ME.

209
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,328
BACK WHEN WE LIVED HERE,

210
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,665
I REMEMBER WE'D GO TO CHURCH
TO PRAY AND STUFF,

211
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,085
AND MOM USED TO ALWAYS SAY THIS
TO ME AND MY SISTER,

212
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,505
"GOD WOULD NEVER PUT US
THROUGH ALL THIS SUFFERING

213
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,842
IF HE DIDN'T THINK
WE COULD BEAR IT."

214
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,804
IT DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL
ANY BETTER, THOUGH.

215
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,807
INSTEAD OF QUOTING THE BIBLE,
WHAT I REALLY WANTED

216
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,811
WAS FOR MOM TO TALK TO US LIKE‐‐
WELL, LIKE A MOM.

217
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,897
BUT YOU KNOW, AFTER SEEING
OUR OLD HOUSE AGAIN,

218
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,440
I THINK I GET IT NOW.

219
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,609
THE WORDS DIDN'T MATTER.

220
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,821
IT WAS THE FEELING
BEHIND THOSE WORDS.

221
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,825
SHE WAS PRAYING FOR ME SO I
WOULDN'T FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF,

222
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,411
SO I COULD BE STRONG
'TIL THE END,

223
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,454
AND NOW I FINALLY GET IT.

224
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,666
Asuna: I'M THE SAME.

225
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,253
SEE, I‐‐I HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD
MY MOM, EITHER.

226
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,424
I CAN'T HEAR WHAT SHE'S
REALLY TRYING TO TELL ME.

227
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,218
SHE CAN'T SEEM TO HEAR ME.

228
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,263
REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME,
THAT SOMETIMES

229
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,016
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT
TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS?

230
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,269
HOW CAN I GET TO BE
STRONG LIKE YOU?

231
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,687
Yuuki: ME?

232
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,690
HEH. I'M NOT STRONG. NO WAY.

233
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,066
Asuna: OH, YES, YOU ARE!

234
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,193
YOU'RE NOT LIKE ME.

235
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,819
WHEN YOU STAND UP TO SOMEONE,

236
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,363
YOU DON'T FLINCH
OR LET THEM INTIMIDATE YOU.

237
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,574
NOTHING SEEMS
TO SCARE YOU AT ALL.

238
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,576
IT'S LIKE
SECOND NATURE FOR YOU.

239
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,661
Yuuki: MM, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

240
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,331
WHEN I WAS LIVING
IN THE REAL WORLD OR‐‐

241
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,540
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN‐‐

242
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,167
MOST OF THE TIME,
I WAS FAKING IT.

243
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,126
Asuna: HUH?

244
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,252
Yuuki: IT'S LIKE I THOUGHT

245
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,087
I HAD TO ACT CHEERFUL,

246
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,049
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA MAKE
MY MOM AND DAD FEEL SAD FOR ME.

247
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,509
Asuna: YUUKI.

248
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,137
Yuuki: YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT I THINK IN THE END?

249
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,680
SO WHAT IF I'M JUST ACTING?

250
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,058
IF I GET TO SPEND
MORE TIME SMILING,

251
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,019
EVEN IF IT'S FAKE,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? AM I RIGHT?

252
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,814
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
I GOT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME LEFT,

253
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,984
AND IT'D BE A SHAME
TO WASTE WHATEVER I DO GOT

254
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,736
BY MOPING AROUND ALL THE TIME,

255
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,906
SO NOW I SAY EXACTLY
WHAT I FEEL TO EVERYONE,

256
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,700
AND IF THEY GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT, WHO CARES?

257
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,494
AT LEAST I SPOKE MY MIND

258
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,455
AND MAYBE EVEN
GOT A LITTLE CLOSER TO 'EM.

259
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,374
Asuna: YOU'RE RIGHT.

260
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,292
THAT'S THE REASON
WE'RE HERE TODAY,

261
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,087
WHY WE'RE SO CLOSE
AFTER ONLY A FEW DAYS.

262
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,505
IT'S ALL 'CAUSE OF YOU.

263
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,257
Yuuki: NOPE,
THAT WASN'T 'CAUSE OF ME.

264
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,967
Asuna: HUH?

265
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,177
Yuuki: IT'S 'CAUSE
EVEN AFTER I RAN AWAY FROM YOU,

266
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,472
YOU TRACKED ME DOWN.

267
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,601
LOOK, HOW 'BOUT YOU TRY TALKING
TO YOUR MOM LIKE YOU DID TO ME?

268
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,104
IF YOU TRY
TELLING HER HOW YOU FEEL,

269
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,064
MAYBE YOU'LL
GET THROUGH TO HER.

270
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,274
Asuna: (SIGHS)

271
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,609
Yuuki: DON'T WORRY.
YOU CAN DO IT.

272
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,279
YOU'RE WAY STRONGER
THAN ME, HONEST!

273
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,532
Asuna: (GASPS)

274
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,741
YUUKI.

275
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,704
Yuuki: YOU HIT ME
WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAD.

276
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,291
THAT'S HOW I KNEW I COULD
TRUST YOU WITH EVERYTHING I HAD.

277
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,502
IN THE END, IT WORKED OUT
FOR BOTH OF US, DIDN'T IT?

278
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,878
Asuna: YES, IT DID.

279
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,547
THANK YOU SO MUCH, YUUKI.

280
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,424

00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,107
Asuna: (SIGHS)

282
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,484

TELLING HER HOW YOU FEEL,

00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,153
MAYBE YOU'LL
GET THROUGH TO HER.

284
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,615
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

285
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,580
Kyoko: COME IN.

286
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,541

00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,052
YOU'RE LATE AGAIN.

289
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,344
Asuna: I'M SORRY.

290
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,013
Kyoko: WELL, IF YOU'RE HUNGRY,

291
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,516
YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE DO
WITH WHATEVER'S IN THE FRIDGE.

292
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,435
OH, AND DON'T FORGET,
THE DEADLINE

293
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,812
FOR YOUR TRANSFER APPLICATION
IS DUE TOMORROW.

294
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,148
MAKE SURE
IT'S FILLED OUT BY MORNING.

295
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,483
Asuna: ACTUALLY, ABOUT THAT...

296
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,235
Kyoko: HM?

297
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,696
Asuna: WE NEED TO TALK, MOTHER.

298
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,573
Kyoko: WELL, WHAT IS IT?

299
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,992
Asuna: I CAN'T
REALLY EXPLAIN IT HERE.

300
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,329
Kyoko: OKAY, THEN.
WHERE SHALL WE GO?

301
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,124
Asuna: THE VIRTUAL WORLD.

302
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,168
IT'LL ONLY BE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

303
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,045
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO USE THIS.

304
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,007
Kyoko: DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

305
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,177
IF YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT LIKE A NORMAL PERSON,

306
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,595
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

307
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,763
Asuna: BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

308
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,765
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN EXPLAIN!

309
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,016
IT'S JUST FIVE MINUTES!

310
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,519
MOM, PLEASE!

311
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,479
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO TELL YOU

312
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,648
WHAT I'M THINKING
AND HOW I'M FEELING, HONEST!

313
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,858
I CAN'T TELL YOU
ANY OF THAT HERE!

314
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,777
JUST THIS ONCE.

FOR YOU TO SEE MY WORLD!

00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,750
Kyoko: BUT NO MATTER
WHAT YOU SAY,

320
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,044
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF ALLOWING YOU

321
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,505
TO ATTEND THAT SCHOOL AGAIN
NEXT YEAR, UNDERSTOOD?

322
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,842
ALSO ONCE YOU'RE DONE, YOU WILL
FILL OUT THAT APPLICATION.

323
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,552
Asuna: OKAY.

324
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,263
Kyoko: SO HOW DO I
USE THAT THING?

325
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,687
Asuna: JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX.
ONCE I TURN IT ON,

326
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,023
IT'LL AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT YOU
TO MY SUB‐ACCOUNT IN THE GAME.

327
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,987
AFTER YOU'RE IN, WAIT FOR ME.

Kyoko: THIS IS SO BIZARRE.

331
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,190
SEEING A STRANGE FACE MIMIC
WHAT I DO IS UNSETTLING.

332
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,734
AND THIS BODY, IT'S SO LIGHT.

333
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,194
Asuna: OH, THAT'S NORMAL.

334
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,112
THAT PARTICULAR AVATAR'S
WEIGHT SETTING

335
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,239
IS ABOUT NINETY POUNDS OR SO.

336
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,575
FEELS LIGHTER
THAN YOUR REAL BODY, HUH?

337
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,076
Kyoko: THAT IS SO RUDE!

338
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,204
I DO NOT APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING.

339
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,747
THAT'S INTERESTING.

340
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,750
YOUR FACE HERE
LOOKS JUST LIKE YOUR REAL ONE.

341
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,751
Asuna: WELL, YES.

342
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,753
Kyoko: ACTUALLY, I TAKE IT BACK.

343
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,172
YOUR REAL FACE
IS PUFFIER THAN THIS ONE.

344
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,965
Asuna: OH, NOW WHO'S BEING RUDE?

345
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,676
I LOOK THE SAME HERE
AS I DO THERE.

346
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,015
Kyoko: WELL, I'M HERE. NOW WHAT?

347
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,934
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT.

348
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,685
Asuna: FOLLOW ME, MOM.

349
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,717
YOU SEE? IT LOOKS JUST LIKE IT.

350
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,387
Kyoko: I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU MEAN.

351
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,431
ALL I SEE IS
SOME OLD CEDAR GRO‐‐(GASPS)

352
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,850
Asuna: DOESN'T IT
BRING BACK MEMORIES

353
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,562
OF THE HOUSE
THAT GRANDMA AND GRANDPA HAD?

354
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,860
I REALLY LOVED
THEIR PLACE IN MIYAGI.

355
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,904
IT WAS MAGICAL.

356
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,499
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

357
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,017
REMEMBER THAT OBON HOLIDAY
WHEN I WAS TWELVE?

358
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,351
YOU, DAD, AND KOICHIRO

359
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,854
WENT TO THE YUUKI
FAMILY COMPOUND IN KYOTO,

360
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,981
AND I WENT TO MIYAGI BY MYSELF.

361
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,524
Kyoko: I REMEMBER.

362
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,192
Asuna: WHEN I GOT THERE,

363
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,894
I APOLOGIZED TO THEM
THAT YOU COULDN'T BE WITH US.

364
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:36,897
I FELT BAD YOU COULDN'T VISIT
OUR ANCESTORS' GRAVES.

365
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:39,233
Kyoko: I WANTED TO,
BUT THAT YEAR,

366
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:41,819
THE YUUKIS WERE HAVING
AN IMPORTANT MEMORIAL SERVICE.

367
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,822
Asuna: NO, MOM,
I'M NOT BLAMING YOU OR ANYTHING.

368
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,492
IN FACT, YOU KNOW
WHAT GRANDPA SAID?

369
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:50,160
HE SAID NOT TO FUSS,

370
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:52,579
BECAUSE HE AND GRANDMA
WERE SO PROUD OF YOU.

371
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:54,123
Kyoko: (GASPS)

372
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:59,336
YOU LEFT THIS VILLAGE,
WENT TO UNIVERSITY,

373
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:01,922
BECAME A SCHOLAR,
AND GOT YOUR WORK PUBLISHED.

374
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:03,924
IT MADE HIM SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU

375
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:06,135
MAKE A NAME FOR YOURSELF
IN THE WORLD.

376
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:10,848
AND THEN HE TOLD ME
SOMETHING I'LL NEVER FORGET,

377
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:14,476
THAT SOMEDAY YOU MIGHT GET TIRED
FROM ALL THE HARD WORK YOU DO

378
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:16,103
AND NEED A BREAK FROM IT,

379
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:18,230
AND IF THAT DAY EVER CAME,

380
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:20,024
HE SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE

381
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:22,526
THE HOUSE AND THE MOUNTAIN
WERE ALWAYS THERE,

382
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:25,571
THAT HE'D GUARD THEM
TO GIVE YOU A PLACE

383
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:28,282
TO COME HOME TO
IF YOU NEEDED IT.

384
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:35,831
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT THEN,

385
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:38,375
BUT NOW, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME,

386
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,961
I THINK I FINALLY DO.

387
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:44,131
LIFE ISN'T JUST ABOUT DOING
THE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY.

388
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:46,842
IT'S ALSO
ABOUT FINDING A WAY TO LIVE

389
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:51,555
WHERE THE HAPPINESS OF EVERYONE
AROUND YOU FULFILLS YOU, TOO.

390
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:55,476
SOMEHOW, I WANT TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO LIVE A LIFE

391
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:57,811
THAT MAKES
EVERYONE AROUND ME HAPPY.

392
00:19:57,853 --> 00:20:00,647
I WANT A LIFE
THAT LETS ME BE THERE

393
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:04,026
FOR THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT WHEN
THEY NEED SOMEONE TO LEAN ON.

394
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,903
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

395
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:08,238
MOTHER, I'LL STUDY
AND WORK HARD,

396
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,450
BUT I WANT TO KEEP GOING
TO THE SCHOOL THAT I LOVE.

397
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:27,466
Asuna: (GASPS)

398
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:34,890
MOM.

399
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,683
Kyoko: (GASPS)

400
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:38,268
WHAT IS THIS?

401
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,688
THIS IS CRAZY.
I'M NOT REALLY CRYING.

402
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,357
Asuna: MOM.

403
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:47,194
YOU CAN'T HIDE IT
WHEN YOU'RE SAD IN THIS WORLD.

404
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:50,572
WHEN YOU CRY,
YOU CRY JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE.

405
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:54,827
Kyoko: SUCH AN ANNOYING WORLD.

406
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:56,870
(CRYING)

407
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,610
Asuna: MORNING, MOM.

408
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:30,946
Kyoko: MORNING.

409
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:35,868
ASUNA, ARE YOU
DETERMINED TO LIVE

410
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:38,412
THE KIND OF SELFLESS LIFE
YOU SPOKE OF?

411
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:40,622
Asuna: MM‐HMM.

412
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:43,250
Kyoko: FINE.
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT,

413
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:46,545
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO CARRY THAT BURDEN,

414
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:49,464
SO MAKE SURE YOU GO TO COLLEGE,

415
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:52,509
AND FOR THAT,
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET BETTER GRADES

416
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:54,469
THIS TRIMESTER AND NEXT YEAR.

417
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:55,929
Asuna: (GASPS)

418
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:57,681
REALLY?

419
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,474
THEN I CAN STAY?

420
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:00,934
Kyoko: THAT'S UP TO YOU.

421
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:02,436
YOU'LL HAVE TO PROVE YOURSELF.

422
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:07,191
DO YOUR BEST.

423
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:12,613
(DOOR CLOSES)

424
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:14,656
Asuna: THANKS, MOM. I WILL.

425
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:18,744
THANK YOU, YUUKI.

426
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:25,667
HERE I GO.
