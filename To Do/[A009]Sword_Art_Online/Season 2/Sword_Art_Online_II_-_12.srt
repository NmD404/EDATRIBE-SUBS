1
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,568
Kirito: HUH. THERE'S NO ONE
ANYWHERE NEAR US.

2
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,829
DEATH GUN AND SINON
AREN'T ON THE MAP,

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,958
BUT COUNTING THEM,
THERE'S SIX PLAYERS LEFT.

4
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:41,959
HUH?

5
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,127
THEY TOOK EACH OTHER OUT.

6
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,296
THAT LEAVES FOUR.

7
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,673
(GASPS)

8
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,843
30 PLAYERS STARTED.

9
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,179
24 ARE OUT, SO THAT LEAVES SIX.

10
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,847
ME AND YAMIKAZE

11
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,308
AND SINON AND DEATH GUN,

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,309
THAT'S 28,

13
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:02,020
AND PALE RIDER MAKES IT 29.

14
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,566
WE'RE SHORT A PLAYER.

15
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,528
DID DEATH GUN
MURDER SOMEONE ELSE

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,321
AFTER HE GOT PALE RIDER?

17
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,117
NO. HIS PARTNER'S BEEN WAITING
AT SINON'S FOR HIS CUE.

18
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,744
HE CAN'T BE TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

19
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,246
UNLESS...

20
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,416
THERE'S ANOTHER ANGLE
TO THIS I'M MISSING.

21
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,440
(ROCKS SLIDE)

22
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,483
Sinon: (GASPS)

23
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,778
WELL, WHAT'D YOU FIND?

24
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,780
Kirito: THERE'S FIVE OF US LEFT,

25
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,032
YOU, ME, YAMIKAZE‐‐

26
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,034
I DIDN'T SEE DEATH GUN, THOUGH.

27
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,245
AND THERE'S ANOTHER PLAYER
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

28
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,122
THE SCAN DIDN'T PICK HIM UP,

29
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,499
SO THEY MIGHT BE HIDING
IN A CAVE LIKE US.

30
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,086
Sinon: THAT'S IT, JUST US FIVE?

31
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,881
WELL, IT'S BEEN AN HOUR
AND 45 MINUTES ALREADY.

32
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,552
SEEING AS HOW THE LAST B.o.B.
ENDED IN ABOUT TWO HOURS,

33
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,679
THIS ONE'S RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,349
HEH. I'M SURPRISED NO ONE'S
CHUCKED A GRENADE IN HERE YET.

35
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,811
Kirito: YEAH. MAYBE WE'VE GOT
DEATH GUN TO THANK FOR THAT.

36
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,063
COULD BE
WHILE HE'S LOOKING FOR US,

37
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,731
HE'S WHITTLING DOWN
THE COMPETITION

38
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,525
WITH THAT RIFLE OF HIS.

39
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,653
Sinon: IF YOU'RE RIGHT,

40
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,197
THEN HE'S A SHOO‐IN
FOR THE MAX‐KILLS AWARD.

41
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,949
WHATEVER.

42
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,617
WE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT YAMIKAZE.

43
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,371
YOU WERE PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE
WHO SHOWED UP ON HIS TERMINAL,

44
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,332
SO WE BETTER GET READY,
'CAUSE HE'LL BE COMING FOR YOU.

45
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,625
Kirito: HE ANY GOOD?

46
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,253
Sinon: HE WAS RUNNER‐UP
IN THE LAST B. o. B.

47
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,547
HE'S YOUR TYPICAL
FULL‐ON AGI TYPE.

48
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,966
THEY CALL HIM THE RUN‐GUN DEMON
OR SOMETHING.

49
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,010
Kirito: UH, RUN WHAT?

50
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,470
Sinon: RUN AND GUN.

51
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,598
YOU RUN, SHOOT, RUN.
IT'S A STYLE OF COMBAT.

52
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,476
HIS MAIN WEAPON'S
A CALICO M900A,

53
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,311
AN ULTRALIGHT SUBMACHINE GUN.

54
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,939
YAMIKAZE COULDN'T COMPETE
WITH ZXE‐D's RARE GUN AND ARMOR

55
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,274
IN THE LAST TOURNEY,

56
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,193
BUT EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T WIN,

57
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,487
SOME PEOPLE SAY
HE'S THE BETTER PLAYER.

58
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,744
Kirito: WHOA.
HE'S REALLY THAT GOOD?

59
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,080
LIKE THE BEST PLAYER
ON JAPAN'S "GGO" SERVER GOOD?

60
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,957
Sinon: YEAH, HE IS,

61
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,585
AND HE MIGHT BE
OUR ACE IN THE HOLE, TOO.

62
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,212
IF YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT DEATH GUN,

63
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,380
THEN I'M THE ONLY ONE
HE'S READY TO KILL.

64
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,217
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE HIS PARTNER'S

65
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,761
WAITING BACK AT MY APARTMENT
RIGHT NOW.

66
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,305
SEE, I FIGURE
THAT IF THAT'S THE CASE,

67
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,183
YAMIKAZE'S NOT IN ANY
REAL DANGER OF GETTING KILLED.

68
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,976
THIS IS GONNA SOUND COLD,

69
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,980
BUT I WAS THINKING HE WOULD MAKE
THE PERFECT DECOY FOR US.

70
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,233
WHEN DEATH GUN SHOOTS YAMIKAZE,

71
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,943
WE'LL KNOW WHERE HE IS.

72
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,947
IN A WAY, WE GOT TWO DECOYS,

73
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,242
HIM IN HERE AND ME I. R. L.

74
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,993
Kirito:
YOU'RE PRETTY BRAVE, SINON.

75
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,036
Sinon: HUH?

76
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,415
NOT EVEN. I'M TRYING
NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT,

77
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,086
TRYING TO AVOID WHAT SCARES ME,
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

78
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,630
ANYWAY, YOU THINK IT'LL WORK?

79
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,883
Kirito: YEAH. I MEAN,
IT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

80
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,178
ALTHOUGH THERE'S
STILL ONE THING

81
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,388
THAT BOTHERS ME.

82
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,390
JUST NOW, WHEN I ADDED UP

83
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,934
THE PLAYERS WHO WERE LEFT
AND WHO WERE DONE,

84
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,936
I COULD ONLY COME UP WITH 28.

85
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,897
PALE RIDER'S 29,
BUT STILL, WE'RE SHORT ONE.

86
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,566
Sinon: NO WAY.
COULD DEATH GUN

87
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,985
HAVE KILLED SOMEONE ELSE
AFTER HE TRIED FOR ME?

88
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,154
HOW'S THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
I MEAN, HIS NUMBER TWO'S

89
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,490
SUPPOSED BE WAITING
AT MY PLACE NOW.

90
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,243
Kirito: RIGHT.
THAT'S HOW I FIGURED IT, TOO,

91
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,538
BUT NOW I'M THINKING
SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON.

92
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,124
BETWEEN THE TIME DEATH GUN
SHOT PALE RIDER

93
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,712
AND WHEN HE TRIED FOR YOU,
ONLY 30 MINUTES HAD GONE BY,

94
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,171
SO BASED ON MY THEORY,

95
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,382
PALE RIDER'S APARTMENT
WOULD HAVE TO BE

96
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,260
NO MORE THAN 30 MINUTES
AWAY FROM YOUR PLACE.

97
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,679
THAT'S KIND OF CONVENIENT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

98
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,972
Sinon: I GUESS,

99
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,932
BUT WHAT OTHER EXPLANATION
IS THERE FOR IT?

100
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,019
Kirito: MAYBE DEATH GUN ISN'T
WORKING WITH JUST THE ONE GUY.

101
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,897
LIKE MAYBE HE'S GOT
A FEW MORE PARTNERS.

102
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,567
IF HE DOES, THEN IT'D BE
POSSIBLE TO KILL ONE PLAYER

103
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,862
WHILE STILL HAVING SOMEONE
AVAILABLE TO KILL YOU

104
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,156
AND ONE FOR YAMIKAZE.

105
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,408
HE COULD BE A TARGET NOW, TOO.

106
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,327
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

107
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,328
(GUNSHOT)

108
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,412
Yamikaze: (GROANS)

109
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,624
Sinon: (GASPS)

110
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,417
OH, MY GOD.

111
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,003
IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND THERE'S
MORE OF 'EM OUT THERE,

112
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,838
HOW MANY MORE
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

113
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,090
Kirito: IF THEY'RE ALL
EX‐LAUGHING COFFIN,

114
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,551
AT LEAST 10, MAYBE MORE.

115
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,928
I DOUBT THEY'RE ALL
INVOLVED WITH THIS,

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,597
BUT WE CAN'T BE SURE

117
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,516
THERE'S ONLY ONE REAL‐WORLD
KILLER OUT THERE ANYMORE.

118
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,645
Sinon: THEY'RE CRAZY.
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY DO THIS

119
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,730
AFTER GETTING OUT
OF "S. A. O." ALIVE?

120
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,108
HOW COULD ANYONE STAY
A PLAYER‐KILLER AFTER THAT GAME?

121
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,571
Kirito:
FOR THE SAME REASON AS US.

122
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,407
WHY DO I KEEP BEING A SWORDSMAN

123
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,118
AND YOU A SNIPER?

124
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,120
(RIFLE RATTLES)

125
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,497
Sinon: I CALLED 'EM P. K.‐ERS,

126
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,873
BUT I TAKE IT BACK.

127
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,001
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE
WHO P. K. IN THIS GAME.

128
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,004
I USED TO RUN WITH A SQUAD
OF P. K.‐ERS MYSELF.

129
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,756
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

130
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,800
P.K.‐ERS HAVE A CODE OF HONOR
THEY STICK TO.

131
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,718
THEY'RE NOT P. K.‐ERS.

132
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,429
THEY KILL PEOPLE WITH POISON
WHILE THEY'RE UNCONSCIOUS

133
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,181
LIKE A BUNCH OF COWARDS.

134
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,225
THERE'S NO HONOR IN MURDER.

135
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,144
THAT'S CHICKENSHIT, STRAIGHT UP,

136
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,897
AND WE CAN'T LET THEM
GET AWAY WITH IT.

137
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,440
Kirito: NO, WE CAN'T.

138
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,193
WE'VE GOT A CHANCE
TO STOP THESE PEOPLE,

139
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,861
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT.

140
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,280
DEATH GUN'S GOING DOWN
ON THIS BATTLEFIELD.

141
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,658
IT'S OVER FOR HIM AND HIS PALS.

142
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,368
I'LL MAKE 'EM ALL PAY.

143
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,037
YEAH,

144
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,374
THIS IS HOW I MAKE AMENDS
FOR WHAT I DID,

145
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,210
FOR LOSING IT
IN THE CHAOS OF BATTLE,

146
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,296
FOR KILLING THOSE TWO PLAYERS
THAT NIGHT

147
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,298
AND THE OTHER ONE LATER ON.

148
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,759
THIS IS HOW I'LL GET CLOSURE.

149
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,178
I'LL PROTECT SINON,

150
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,596
TAKE OUT YAMIKAZE,

151
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,181
AND END DEATH GUN.

152
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,852
IT WON'T BE EASY,
BUT IT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

153
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,354
Sinon: I'M GONNA
TAKE YAMIKAZE OUT.

154
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,690
I WON'T LET DEATH GUN KILL HIM.

155
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,691
Kirito: HUH?

156
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,067
Sinon: YAMIKAZE'S TOUGH.

157
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,070
I DOUBT EVEN YOU
COULD FINISH HIM WITH ONE HIT,

158
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,657
AND IF HE'S BUSY WITH YOU,
DEATH GUN'S SURE TO GO FOR HIM.

159
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,035
Kirito: THEN HOW ARE WE
GONNA DEAL WITH THAT?

160
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,786
Sinon: DID YOU FORGET WHAT I AM?

161
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,414
I'M A SNIPER.

162
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,083
I'LL HAVE EYES ON YOU
THE WHOLE TIME,

163
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,794
SO ONCE THEY MOVE ON YOU,
I'LL KNOW THEIR LOCATIONS.

164
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,839
I'LL HIT YAMIKAZE FIRST.
THEN I'LL GO FOR DEATH GUN.

165
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,716
Kirito: OKAY, THEN.

166
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,594
WE GO WITH YOUR PLAN.

167
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,887
ALL RIGHT.

168
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,723
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE
PRETTY CLOSE BY NOW.

169
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,059
I'M GONNA HOP ON THE BUGGY
AND HEAD OUT.

170
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,810
LEAVE THE CAVE RIGHT AFTER I DO,

171
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,146
AND GET SET UP
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

172
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,865
Sinon:
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE, PARTNER.

173
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,911
(CHUCKLES)

174
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,729
(GASPS)

175
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,815
YAMIKAZE'S COMING FROM THE WEST,

176
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,484
SO IF A SHOT
COMES FROM THE EAST,

177
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,736
IT'LL PROBABLY BE DEATH GUN.

178
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,154
HE'S GOT THAT CLOAK,

179
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,490
SO WHEN HE SHOOTS,
HE'LL BE INVISIBLE.

180
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,202
IF HE HITS KIRITO IN THE HEART
OR HEAD, IT'S OVER.

181
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,665
BUT IF YOU CAN CUT
MY BULLET IN HALF,

182
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,500
YOU CAN DODGE HIS, RIGHT?

183
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,960
RIGHT, KIRITO?

184
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,254
MY FIRST PRIORITY

185
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,589
IS TAKING YAMIKAZE
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

186
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,259
IF I MISS, KIRITO WILL GET SHOT.

187
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,679
THEN DEATH GUN
WILL FIND ME AND KILL ME.

188
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,807
MY LIFE, MY REAL LIFE,

189
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,894
DEPENDS ON A SINGLE BULLET,
LIKE IT DID THAT DAY.

190
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,693
PLEASE, HECATE.

191
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,779
I'M WEAK,
AND I NEED YOUR STRENGTH,

192
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,657
THE STRENGTH
TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF

193
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,075
AND MOVE ON.

194
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,466
Kirito: (SIGHS)

195
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,392
SOUTHWEST.

196
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,394
THAT'S YAMIKAZE.

197
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,022
DON'T WORRY. SINON'S GOT HIM.

198
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,065
(HEART BEATING)

199
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,319

Sinon: WHAT DO I DO?

202
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,533
I COULD TRY
TO SHOOT IN FRONT OF HIM

203
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,410
OR SHOOT AT HIS FEET,
HOPE HE PANICS,

204
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,037
AND THEN TAKE HIM OUT.

205
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,585
NO. ONCE HE'S
GOT KIRITO IN RANGE,

206
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,587
HE'LL STOP TO STEADY HIS AIM.

207
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,964
I HAVE TO WAIT TILL HE DOES.

208
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,299
I'LL BE PATIENT.

209
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,843
DON'T WORRY, KIRITO.

210
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,054
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK.

211
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,816
Kirito: CONCENTRATE.

212
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,111
HOME IN ON HIS DRIVE TO KILL

213
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,696
LIKE LAST TIME.

214
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,584
THAT'S RIGHT.

215
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,087
I COULD FEEL
THEIR LUST FOR MURDER.

216
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,256
THAT'S HOW I NOTICED 'EM.

217
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,386
THE FIRST GUY WHO ATTACKED ME,

218
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,721
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

219
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:53,481
Death Gun: KIRITO,
SOMEDAY I'LL KILL YOU PROPERLY.

00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,496

245
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,054
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

246
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,765

WITH KI‐‐I MEAN KAZUTO?

247

Aki: NO, HE'S OKAY.

248

I KNOW IT LOOKS BAD,
BUT HE'S NOT IN DANGER.

249

FROM THE GAME

Asuna: UH‐HUH. HE'S IN BATTLE.

260
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:59,056

HIS HEART'S RACING SO MUCH.

ONE OF LAUGHING COFFIN'S LEADERS
WAS A MASTER WITH AN ESTOC,

BUT WHAT WAS HE CALLED?

266
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,697
"STERBEN"?

267
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,783
ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE STEVEN?

268
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:18,784
Aki: IT'S NOT.

269
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:19,785
Yui: SHE'S RIGHT.

270
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:21,453

271
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:24,456
I KNOW IT.
IT'S A MEDICAL TERM WE USE.

272
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:27,084
IT'S PRONOUNCED "SHTERBEN."

273

Asuna: "SHTERBEN"?

274
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:31,672
Aki: IT MEANS "TO DIE."

275
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:35,759
IN HOSPITALS, WE USE THAT WORD
WHEN A PATIENT'S PASSED AWAY.

280
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:52,526
THAT'S AN INTERESTING WEAPON
YOU'VE GOT THERE.

281
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:54,737
IF I'D KNOWN THERE WERE
METAL SWORDS IN "GGO,"

282
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:56,739
I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
MY HANDS ON ONE.

IT CAN'T BE
ANY LONGER OR HEAVIER,

THE BEST SWORD I CAN MAKE,

289

I'D BE HAPPY WITH.

WITH HIGH STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS?

291

YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

292
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:21,680
MUST BE PRETTY TOUGH FOR YOU,

293
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:24,725
HAVING TO TWIRL
THAT FLASHLIGHT AROUND.

00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,185
(PHOTON SWORD HUMS)

295

NOT AS BAD AS ALL THAT.

296
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:32,107
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT IT'D BE
LIKE TO FIGHT WITH ONE OF THESE.

297
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,610
BESIDES, A SWORD'S A SWORD.

298
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:38,071
IF I CAN SLASH YOU AND
BURN THROUGH YOUR H. P. WITH IT,

299
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:39,573
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

300
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:42,075
Death Gun: (CHUCKLES)
YOU TALK A GOOD GAME,

301
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:44,870
BUT IT'S ALL TALK.

302
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:49,333
YOU SUCKED IN TOO MUCH
ROTTEN AIR FROM THE REAL WORLD.

303
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:51,752
THAT HALF‐ASS VORPAL STRIKE
YOU JUST PULLED,

304
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:55,130
IF THE OLD YOU SAW IT,
HE'D SHAKE HIS HEAD.

305
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:57,174
Kirito: MAYBE SO,

306
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:59,343
BUT THE SAME GOES FOR YOU, TOO.

307
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,386
YOU'RE LIVING IN THE PAST.

Death Gun: YOU REMEMBER.

310
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:10,646
I'M IMPRESSED.

311
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:12,189

312
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:15,526
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

313
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,445
I'M A GENUINE RED PLAYER,

314
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:21,156
WHILE YOU ARE NOT.

315
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:27,287
YOU KILLED
ONLY BECAUSE YOU WERE SCARED,

316
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:29,957
SCARED AND DESPERATE TO SURVIVE.

317
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:31,792
AND INSTEAD OF FACING IT,

318
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:34,795
I BET YOU TRIED
TO FORGET IT EVEN HAPPENED,

319
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,797

I MIGHT BE A COWARD,

BUT STILL, I'LL STOP YOU
FROM KILLING AGAIN.

323
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,849
I FIGURED OUT HOW ZXE‐D
AND THE OTHERS WERE MURDERED.

324
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,227
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT HANDGUN OF YOURS,

325
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,021
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
SPECIAL POWERS EITHER.

326
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:56,108
Death Gun:
HOW'D THOSE PEOPLE DIE THEN?

327
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:58,819
Kirito: BACK AT THE TERMINALS
AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE,

328
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:00,320
YOU USED THAT CLOAK

329
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:02,990
TO SCOPE OUT THE ADDRESSES
OF THE B. o. B. CONTESTANTS.

330
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,868
THEN YOU HAD SOMEONE
BREAK INTO THEIR APARTMENTS

331
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:10,122
AND TIMED IT SO WHEN YOU FIRED,
THEY'D INJECT A DRUG INTO 'EM,

332
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:12,708
MAKING IT LOOK
LIKE THEY DIED OF HEART FAILURE.

333
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:14,209
THAT'S HOW YOU DID IT.

334
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:16,920
THE MINISTRY
OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS

335
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:19,047
HAS THE IN‐GAME
AND REAL‐WORLD INFO

336
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,341
OF EVERY SINGLE PLAYER
FROM "S. A. O."

337
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:24,970
ONCE THEY GET YOUR HANDLE,
THEY'LL FIND OUT YOUR REAL NAME,

338
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:28,140
YOUR REAL ADDRESS, AND ALL
THE EVIL SHIT YOU'VE EVER DONE.

339
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:29,933
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

340
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:34,021
IT'S ALL OVER FOR YOU,

341
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:37,024
SO LOG OUT,
AND TURN YOURSELF IN.

342
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:41,278
Death Gun: YOU THINK YOU'VE
GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT,

343
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,654
BUT YOU DON'T.

344
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:45,949
AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

345
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,784
WANT TO KNOW WHY?

346
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:52,998
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER
REMEMBER WHAT MY HANDLE WAS.

347
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,166
Kirito: YOU THINK SO?

348
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,293
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE I WON'T?

349
00:20:56,335 --> 00:21:00,047
Death Gun: (CHUCKLES)
YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER

350
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:03,508
THE REASON YOU FORGOT IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

351
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,968
THINK BACK.

352
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,888
AFTER THAT BATTLE
BETWEEN YOUR GROUP AND MINE,

353
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,891
I TRIED TO TELL YOU MY NAME,

354
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,393
BUT YOU SAID...

355
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:18,231
Kirito: THERE'S NO POINT
IN GIVING ME YOUR NAME.

356
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:19,858
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW IT.

357
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,320
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

358
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,325
(GASPS)

359
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,661
Death Gun: YOU CAN'T
REMEMBER MY HANDLE,

360
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:32,037
AND YOU NEVER WILL.

361
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,206
I NEVER GAVE IT TO YOU,

362
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:36,875
AND NOW I'M GOING
TO CUT YOU DOWN.

363
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,752
I'LL LEAVE YOU LYING HERE,

364
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:41,338
WATCHING HELPLESSLY
AS I KILL THE GIRL,

365
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,132
AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME!

366
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,265
(LAUGHS)

367
00:21:56,353 --> 00:21:58,146
(CHUCKLES)

368
00:21:58,188 --> 00:21:59,731
STINGS, DOESN'T IT?

369
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:04,069
THIS IS MADE FROM THE BEST METAL
YOU CAN GET IN THE GAME.

370
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:08,740
IT'S ARMOR PLATING
FROM A SPACE BATTLESHIP.

371
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:11,451
(LAUGHS)
