00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,434
(RIFLE CLICKS)

4
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,479
(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)

00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,107
Monster: (SHRIEKING)

6
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,228
(HEART BEATING)

7
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,176
Sinon: (PANTING)

8
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,032
ULTIMA RATIO HECATE TWO.

9
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,119
HECATE.

10
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,909
Player: (GRUNTS) YO, DYNE!

11
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,744
YOU SURE YOU GOT
THE RIGHT INFO?

12
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,705
ARE THEY COMIN', OR WHAT?

13
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,665
Dyne: THEY'RE COMIN',
ALL RIGHT.

14
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,793
I CHECKED THE ROUTE MYSELF,
SO RELAX.

15
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,549
I BET THEY'RE BUSY CLEARING
SOME BIG‐ASS MONSTER SPAWN.

16
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,843
THAT MEANS YOUR CUT'LL
BE BIGGER THIS TIME,

17
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,470
SO NO COMPLAINING.

18
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,888
Player: DUDE,
NO ONE'S COMPLAININ'!

19
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,389
BUT SINCE WE'RE
TALKIN' ABOUT IT,

20
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,850
AIN'T THESE THE SAME
JOKERS WE HIT LAST WEEK?

21
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,936
THEY COULDA WISED UP TO US
AND CHANGED THEIR ROUTE.

22
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,105
Dyne: ALL THAT SQUAD DOES
IS HUNT MONSTERS.

23
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,107
THEY DON'T CARE HOW MANY
TIMES THEY GET ATTACKED,

24
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,902
'CAUSE THEY'LL JUST MAKE UP
FOR IT ON THEIR NEXT HUNT.

25
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,612
FOR PLAYER‐HUNTER
SQUADS LIKE US,

26
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,363
THEY MAKE THE PERFECT TARGET.

27
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,742
THEY MOVE BY ALGORITHM,
JUST LIKE THE MONSTERS.

28
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,577
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THEY'RE CHUMPS.

29
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,329
Player #2:
DAMN STRAIGHT.

30
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,164
Dyne: AS FOR WEAPONS,
THEY'RE GEARED UP

31
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,333
WITH OPTICAL GUNS
FOR HUNTING MONSTERS.

32
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,835
BUT WE'VE GOT DEFENSE SHIELDS,
SO AS LONG AS THOSE'RE UP,

33
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,712
IT'S EASY PICKINGS.

34
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,214
Player 1: WELL, WHAT IF
THEY GOT SMART?

35
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,424
LIKE, WHAT IF THEY'RE
READY FOR US THIS TIME?

36
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,510
Dyne: WE HIT 'EM NOT
TOO LONG AGO, RIGHT?

37
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,846
I DOUBT THEY GOT THEIR HANDS ON
ENOUGH LIVE‐AMMO GUNS THAT FAST.

38
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,057
BY NOW, THEY MIGHT HAVE
ONE FIREARM FOR SUPPORT,

39
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,391
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

40
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,060
AND BESIDES...

41
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,230
WE GOT THE BEST SNIPER
IN "GGO" WATCHIN' OUR BACKS.

42
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,281
WE'VE GOT ALL
OUR BASES COVERED.

43
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,450
RIGHT, SINON?

44
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,077
Sinon: YEP.

45
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,453
Dyne: (SIGHS)

46
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,996
Player #1: GUESS I CAN'T
ARGUE WITH THAT.

47
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,623
WITH A CRACK SHOT
LIKE SINON UP HERE,

48
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,999
THINGS'RE LOOKIN' GOO‐OOD!

49
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,292
Dyne: (CLEARING THROAT)

50
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,919
IT'S BETTER THAN GOOD.

51
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,089
Player #1: WELL, "IF"‐‐
IT'S A BIG "IF," BUT STILL.

52
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,925
IF SHE MISSED,
I'D BE COOL WITH THAT.

53
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,343
IT'LL TAKE THEM ABOUT A MINUTE

54
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,303
TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE THE SHOT CAME FROM.

55
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,471
WHILE THEY'RE DOIN' THAT,

56
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,973
I'LL BE IN POSITION.

57
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,642
I'LL HOSE 'EM DOWN
AND RAKE IN THE MON‐EY.

58
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,354
Dyne:
EASY, COWBOY.

59
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,773
Ginrou: HEYA, DOLLFACE.
I WAS WONDERIN'.

60
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,275
WHAT YOU DOIN' AFTER THIS?

61
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,944
I FOUND A GUN SHOP WITH
AN AWESOME INVENTORY.

62
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,865
MAYBE WE COULD GO GET SOME TEA
OR MAYBE DO SOMETHIN' ELSE!

63
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,950
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

64
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,536
(CHUCKLES)

65
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,830
Sinon: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN, GINROU.

66
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,541
BESIDES, THERE'S STUFF I
HAVE TO DO WHEN I LOG OUT.

67
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,085
Ginrou: AH, COME ON, DOLLFACE!
WHAT "STUFF"?!

68
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,920
WAIT. ARE YOU
STILL IN SCHOOL?

69
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,130
THAT'S KINDA HOT.

70
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,756
YOU GOT A REPORT DUE?!

71
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,592
Sinon: YEAH. RIGHT.

72
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,843
Player #2:
LAY OFF HER, GINROU.

73
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,887
DON'T PUT HER ON
THE SPOT LIKE THAT.

74
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,389
WE'RE WORKIN', SO DON'T
BRING UP THE REAL WORLD IN HERE.

75
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,141
Player #3: YEAH, MAN!

76
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,852
THIS AIN'T THE TIME OR PLACE
TO RE‐SPEC YOUR SOLO STATUS!

77
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,478
Ginrou: LIKE YOU GUYS CAN TALK!

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,898
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
EITHER OF YOU GOT LUCKY?!

79
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,983
Player #3: (LAUGHING)
LAST NIGHT! WITH YOUR SISTER!

80
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,401
Sinon: (SIGHS)

81
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,986
Dyne: KNOCK IT OFF.
STAY SHARP.

82
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,029
Player #4: GOT 'EM.

83
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,701
Dyne: 'BOUT TIME
THEY SHOWED UP TO THE PARTY.

84
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,749
YUP. IT'S THEM.

85
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,294
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

86
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,296
THAT'S ONE MORE
THAN LAST WEEK.

87
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,767
WE GOT FOUR OPTICAL BLASTERS
IN THE FRONT.

88
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,104
I SEE ONE LARGE CALIBER
LASER RIFLE.

89
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,776
NOT A PROBLEM.
AND A GUY WITH A MINIMI.

90
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,569
HE GOES DOWN FIRST.

91
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,532
THE NEW GUY IN THE BACK,

92
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,577
HE'S GOT A CLOAK ON.
CAN'T SEE WHAT HE'S CARRYING.

93
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,745
Ginrou: HE'S WEARIN' A CLOAK?!

94
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,746
Dyne: YEAH.

95
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,289
Ginrou: MAYBE IT'S HIM,

96
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,375
THAT DEATH GUN GUY
EVERYONE'S TALKIN' ABOUT!

97
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,876
Dyne: HUH. NO WAY!

98
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,921
WHAT, YOU BELIEVE IN
FAIRY TALES NOW?

99
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,589
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S
STRENGTH‐BUILD.

100
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,716
PROBABLY JUST A COURIER, THOUGH.

101
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,052
IF ANYTHING, I BET HE'S
CARRYING THE SQUAD'S AMMO,

102
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,762
ENERGY PACKS AND DROPS.

103
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,597
EH, WE CAN IGNORE HIM.

104
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,772
Sinon: I'M GETTING A BAD VIBE
FROM THE GUY IN BACK.

105
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,692
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE HIM OUT
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.

106
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,277
Dyne: NO WAY. HE'S NOT
CARRYING ANY WEAPONS.

107
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,321
Sinon: MAYBE HE IS.
MAYBE HE ISN'T.

108
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,281
HE'S AN UNKNOWN,
SO HE'S A RISK.

109
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,158
Dyne: I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYIN',

110
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,577
BUT THERE'S ALSO A MINIMI
OUT THERE, AND THAT'S A PROBLEM.

111
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,955
IF HE STARTS LIGHTING US UP
AND THOSE BLASTERS MOVE IN,

112
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,915
IT'S GONNA GET UGLY.

113
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,335
Sinon: UNDERSTOOD. I'LL DROP
THE GUY WITH THE MINIMI FIRST,

114
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,797
BUT MY SECOND BULLET'S
GOT MR. CLOAK'S NAME ON IT.

115
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,717
Player #4: HATE TO INTERRUPT YOU
GUYS, BUT THEY'RE CLOSING ON US.

116
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,385
THEY'RE AT TWENTY‐FIVE
HUNDRED METERS.

117
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,886
Dyne: ALL RIGHT.

118
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,388
'WE'RE GONNA STICK WITH
THE ORIGINAL PLAN

119
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,306
AND WAIT FOR 'EM
IN THE SHADOW OF THAT BUILDING.

120
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,268
SINON, CALL OUT
IF THE SITUATION CHANGES.

121
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,228
WAIT FOR MY ORDER TO FIRE.

122
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,730
Sinon: ROGER.

123
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,189

HAVEN'T CHANGED THEIR COURSE,

126
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,610
OR THEIR SPEED.

127
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,445
THEY'RE FOUR HUNDRED
METERS FROM YOU,

128
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,738
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FROM ME.

129
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,865
Dyne: PRETTY FAR.
CAN YOU MAKE THE SHOT?

130
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,241
Sinon: NO SWEAT.

131
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,285

FIRE WHEN READY.

FIFTEEN HUNDRED METERS,

138
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,178
THAT'S NOTHING,

139
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,515
LIKE TOSSING A WAD OF PAPER
INTO A TRASH CAN.

140
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,225
NO WAY.

141
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,645

I CLEARED THE FIRST TARGET,

148
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,511
BUT I COULDN'T POP
THE SECOND ONE.

149

SIT TIGHT UP THERE, YOU HEAR?

THEY'RE NOT LATE 'CAUSE
THEIR HUNT WAS RUNNING LONG.

THEY'RE MOVING SLOW
IN THE FIELD,

'CAUSE THE WEIGHT
OF THAT MINIGUN'S

WHAT WAS THAT?

00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,121
IF HE CAN SMILE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIREFIGHT,

165
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,915
HE MUST BE PRETTY BRAVE...

166

00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,627
WHERE, DAMN IT. WHERE?!

174
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,006
S‐SINON?

175
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,944
Player #3: SINON!
ARE YOU HIT?

176
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,033
Dyne: BASTARDS.

177
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,951
(GROWLS)

178
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,328
THEY TEAMED UP WITH
A FREAKIN' BODYGUARD!

179
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,289
Sinon: BODYGUARD?

180
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,833
Dyne: IT'S THAT GUY
WITH THE MINIGUN.

181
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,461
HE'S A MACHO PRICK,
CALLS HIMSELF BEHEMOTH.

182
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,754
Sinon: WELL, WE CAN'T
KEEP SITTING HERE,

183
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,547
'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA
WIPE US OUT!

184
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,092
THAT MINIGUN'S ONLY GOT
SO MUCH AMMO TO FIRE.

185
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,553
IF WE ATTACK HIM AT ONCE,
HE'LL PANIC

186
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,096
AND BURN THROUGH
THE REST OF IT.

187
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,640
JIN AND MISO,
YOU TAKE THE LEFT FLANK.

188
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,559
DYNE AND I'LL
COME IN FROM THE RIGHT.

189
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,853
ARASHI, YOU STAY HERE
AND COVER US.

190
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,605
Dyne: THAT'S CRAZY.

191
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,315
Dyne: WHAT ABOUT
THE THREE GUYS OUT THERE

192
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,525
CARRYING THE BLASTERS?
EVEN IF WE RUSH 'EM,

193
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,444
OUR DEFENSE SHIELDS
AREN'T ENOUGH!

194
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,029
Sinon: RIGHT, BUT THEIR
BLASTERS CAN'T FIRE

195
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,447
AS FAST AS A LIVE‐AMMO GUN.

196
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,865
WE CAN JUST DODGE 'EM!

197
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,825
Dyne: SCREW THAT! IF WE GO
CHARGING OUT THERE,

198
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,328
THAT MINIGUN'LL
TURN US INTO CONFETTI!

199
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,622
(DEEP BREATH)

200
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,333
SORRY, BUT WE'RE PACKIN' IT IN.

201
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,543
IT'S BETTER IF WE
LOGGED OUT RIGHT NOW.

202
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,796
AT LEAST WE'LL BE
ABLE TO GET AWAY.

203
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,382
Sinon: YOU DON'T GET AWAY
FROM THINGS BY LOGGING OUT.

204
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,551
Dyne: ARE YOU NUTS?! THIS IS
A GAME, FOR CHRIST SAKES!

205
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,011
THINK ABOUT IT.

206
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,638
EVEN IF WE CHARGED 'EM,
WE'D JUST DIE!

207
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,058
‐ Sinon: THEN DIE!
‐ Dyne: (GASPS)

208
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,602
Sinon: IT IS A GAME, SO YOU
CAN AT LEAST HAVE THE BALLS

209
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,104
TO FACE DEATH HERE
INSTEAD OF WHININ'!

210
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,570
Sinon: WE CAN DO THIS.

211
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,823
IF YOU CAN DISTRACT
THE MINIGUN FOR THREE SECONDS,

212
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,116
I CAN TAKE HIM OUT.

213
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,325
Player #3: O‐OKAY.

214
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,827
Sinon: GOOD.
THEN WE'LL SPLIT UP

215
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,829
AND ATTACK HIM
FROM BOTH SIDES. GOT IT?

216
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,038
‐ Player #2: GOT IT!
‐ Player #3: GOT IT!

217
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,471
Sinon: GO!

218
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,861
DYNE! COVER ME!

219
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,640
Dyne: HOW YOU LIKE THAT, PUNK?!

220
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,667
(SCREAMING)

221
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,127
SCREW YOU!

222
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,299

225
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,861
Sinon: NICE GOING! NOW...

226
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,615
I'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW TO
GET INTO BEHEMOTH'S BLIND SPOT.

227
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,161
I'D BETTER MOVE FAST.

228
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,580
OR HE'S GONNA GET
A BEAD ON MY LOCATION.

229
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,630
BULLETS ARE FLYIN', AND HE'S GOT
THE GUTS TO SMILE LIKE THAT.

230
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,970
MAYBE I WILL,
TOO, WHEN I KILL HIM.

231
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,695
(GASPS)

232
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,752
Behemoth: (LAUGHING)

233
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,028
Sinon: YOU'RE DEAD.

(SHUDDERS)

235
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,442
DAMN IT.

236
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,279

00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,176
