1
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,354
Kirito: WHAT'S WRONG, YUI?

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,898
Yui: I HAVE A FEELING

3
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,234
THERE'S A LOT MORE AT STAKE HERE
THAN WE THINK.

4
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,655
THIS WILL REQUIRE
SOME EXPLAINING.

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,200
WHILE ALL V. R. M. M. O. s
ORIGINATE FROM THE SEED PROGRAM,

6
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,994
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THEM AND "ALFHEIM ONLINE."

7
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,873
YOU SEE, A STRIPPED‐DOWN VERSION
OF THE CARDINAL SYSTEM

8
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,084
RUNS THE OTHER
ACTIVE V. R. M. M. O. s,

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,419
BUT THE ONE
THAT OPERATES THIS GAME

10
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,588
IS A COPY
OF THE FULL‐SPEC VERSION

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,131
THAT RAN "SWORD ART ONLINE."

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,550
Kirito: FULL‐SPEC VERSION?

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,761
Yui: THE ORIGINAL
CARDINAL SYSTEM HAD A FEATURE

14
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,930
WHICH COULD AUTOMATICALLY
GENERATE QUESTS.

15
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,809
IT WOULD LOG ON TO THE NET
AND SEARCH FOR VARIOUS LEGENDS

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,769
AND FOLKLORE
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

17
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,356
THEN IT WOULD TAKE THE STORIES
IT FOUND, ADAPT THE DATA,

18
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,943
AND USE IT TO GENERATE
AN INFINITE NUMBER OF QUESTS.

19
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,778
Kirito: HOW ABOUT
THIS QUEST, THEN?

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,364
IS IT AUTOGENERATED
BY CARDINAL, TOO?

21
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,701
Yui: AFTER SEEING HOW THAT NPC
WAS ACTING JUST NOW,

22
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,661
I HAVE A FEELING IT IS.

23
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:21,290
IF THAT IS THE CASE HERE,
THEN NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,

24
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,293
THIS QUEST WILL END
THE SAME WAY THE MYTH DOES.

25
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,504
JUST NOW, I RAN A QUICK CHECK
ON MY ARCHIVES.

26
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,340
ACCORDING TO MY DATA
AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

27
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,676
THE NORSE MYTHOLOGY
"A. L. O." IS BASED ON,

28
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,679
THIS QUEST MUST END
IN A FINAL WAR EVENT.

29
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,765
THE FROST GIANTS FROM JOTUNHEIM
AND NIFLHEIM

30
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,144
AREN'T THE ONLY ONES
WHO WANT TO ATTACK ARUN.

31
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,564
BELOW NIFLHEIM IS A FIERY REALM
CALLED MUSPELHEIM,

32
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,524
WHERE THE FLAME GIANTS LIVE.

33
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,151
ACCORDING TO THE MYTH,

34
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,155
THEY WILL ATTACK THE WORLD TREE
AND BURN IT TO THE GROUND.

35
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,867
Leafa: RAGNAROK,
THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS.

36
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,535
UH‐UH. I DON'T BUY IT.

37
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,537
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GAME SYSTEM

38
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,331
WOULD DESTROY ITS OWN MAPS
ON PURPOSE.

39
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,665
IT'S GOTTA BE A MISTAKE.

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,794
Yui: I'M SORRY,
BUT THERE'S NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.

41
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,588
THE CARDINAL SYSTEM
HAS THE AUTHORITY

42
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,758
TO DESTROY ITS MAPS
IF IT WANTS. I KNOW THIS,

43
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,594
BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL
CARDINAL SYSTEM'S LAST TASK

44
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,346
WAS DESTROYING AINCRAD,

45
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,223
THE FLOATING CASTLE
OF "SWORD ART ONLINE."

46
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,809
Leafa: NO WAY.

47
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,561
Asuna: (SIGHS)

48
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,480

MY BLACKSMITH'S SHOP.

50
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,943
Klein: THERE GO MY CHANCES
OF EVER MEETING MY SOUL MATE.

51
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,820
Sinon: EVEN IF
THIS RAGNAROK THING HAPPENS

52
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,531
AND IT ALL DELETES,
CAN'T THE SERVER BE ROLLED BACK

53
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,284
THE WAY IT WAS FROM ONE
OF THE BACKUPS IT'S MADE?

54
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,746
Yui: THE SYSTEM HAS
AN AUTOBACKUP FEATURE,

55
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,414
BUT THOSE FILES WON'T HELP.

56
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,958
IT ONLY SAVES PLAYER DATA,
NOT FIELD DATA,

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,627
SO YOU CAN'T RESTORE EVERYTHING.

58
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,920
All: (SIGH)

59
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,548

‐ All: HMM?

60
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,677
Klein: I DON'T GOT IT.

61
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,095
Lisbeth: YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

62
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,721
Klein: STOP RAZZING ME.

63
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,141
I WAS TRYING TO CALL A G.M.
TO SEE IF HE KNEW ABOUT THIS.

64
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,226
IT AIN'T HAPPENING NOW.

65
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,144
IT'S AFTER HOURS.

66
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,729
SUPPORT'S CLOSED.

67
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,231
Kirito: THAT FIGURES.

68
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,566
IT'S SUNDAY MORNING
JUST BEFORE NEW YEAR'S.

70
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,153

Kirito: YEAH.

72
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,366

AND GET TO THE LAST LEVEL.

81
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,664
THE GOLD ONE'S TOUGH.

82
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,374
NOTHING WE DO
IS SLOWING HIM DOWN.

83
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,625
Kirito: YEAH.

84
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,002
Klein: THIS SUCKS.
IF WE ONLY HAD A MAGE

85
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,004

IN OUR PARTY.

86

87
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,049
THAT'S HILARIOUS
COMING FROM YOU.

IT WOULDN'T HELP, ANYWAY,
'CAUSE THE DUDE IN THE BACK

89
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,805
WITH THE HIGH RESISTANCE
TO MAGIC WOULD JUST MOVE UP.

90
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,473

WE'VE ONLY GOT
ABOUT 2 1/2 MINUTES

98
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,094

99
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,429

101
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,308

102
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,476
IF WE DIE NOW,
WE WON'T HAVE TIME

103
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,061
TO START OVER
FROM THE SAVE POINT.

104
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,439

105
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,941
HEY, GUYS,

106
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,319
THERE'S ONE THING
WE HAVEN'T TRIED YET.

107
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,362
IF WE USE SWORD SKILLS
WITH MAGIC,

108
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,073
WE MIGHT DO SOME DAMAGE
TO THIS GOLD BASTARD.

109
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,034
IT'LL LEAVE YOU
WIDE OPEN, THOUGH,

110
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,412
IT'S DO‐OR‐DIE TIME!

111
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,373
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE FOCUS
OUR ATTACK AND WIPE HIM OUT?

112
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,625

113

Kirito: DON'T POP
A BLOOD VESSEL.

178
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,864
ALL RIGHT. WE CAN'T
STAND AROUND CHATTING ALL DAY.

179
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,700
LEAFA, HOW MUCH TIME
WE GOT LEFT?

180
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:41,701
Leafa: OH, RIGHT.

181
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,328
AT THE PACE WE'RE GOING,

182
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,914
WE SHOULD HAVE
MAYBE ANOTHER HOUR OR SO.

183
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,956
Kirito: THAT'S IT?

184
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,416
YUI, DO YOU KNOW

185
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,586
HOW BIG THESE LAST COUPLE
OF FLOORS ARE GONNA BE?

186
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,630
Yui: YES. THE THIRD FLOOR

187
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,924
IS ABOUT 70% THE SIZE
OF THE SECOND,

188
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,801
AND THE FOURTH FLOOR IS
PRETTY MUCH JUST THE BOSS ROOM.

189
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,845
Kirito: I FIGURE
THE LAST BOSS FIGHT

190
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,722
WILL TAKE US
30 MINUTES TO FINISH.

191
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,226
THAT MEANS WE ONLY GOT ABOUT
30 MINUTES TO GET TO HIS ROOM.

192
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,310
Lisbeth: THAT SETTLES IT.

193

216
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,822

Kirito: IT'S A TRAP.

220
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,494
Lisbeth: IT'S A TRAP.

221
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,496
Sinon: IT'S SO A TRAP.

222
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,000
Klein: WELL, MAYBE IT IS.

223
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,418
MAYBE IT ISN'T.

224
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,336
Kirito: WHAT DO YOU THINK, YUI?

225
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,714
Yui: SHE'S AN NPC.
HER CORE PROGRAMMING

226
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,216
IS CONNECTED
TO THE LANGUAGE ENGINE MODULE,

227
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,593
JUST LIKE URD'S,

228
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,971
ALTHOUGH THERE IS
ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM.

229
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,223
THIS ONE HAS AN H. P. GAUGE.

230
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,225
Kirito: YEAH,
THAT'S A BIG RED FLAG.

231
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,353
IF SHE'S GOT AN H. P. GAUGE,
WE MIGHT HAVE TO FIGHT HER.

232
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,522
‐ Asuna: A TRAP.
‐ Silica: TOTALLY A TRAP.

233
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,191
‐ Leafa: OBVIOUSLY A TRAP.
‐ Pina: (SQUAWKS)

234
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,319
Kirito: IT MIGHT BE A TRAP.
IT MIGHT NOT. I DON'T KNOW.

235
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,696
EITHER WAY, WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO TAKE THE CHANCE.

236
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,615
WE CAN'T WASTE ANY MORE TIME.

237
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,533
WE GOTTA GET TO THRYMR ASAP.

238
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,243
Klein: OH, RIGHT. YEAH.

239
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,287
WE GOT A JOB TO DO.

240
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,375

241
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,377

243
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,218
Klein: I KNOW IT'S A TRAP.

244
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,637
I'M NOT STUPID.

245
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,473
BUT EVEN IF IT IS A TRAP,

246
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,475
EVEN IF I KNOW IT'S A TRAP,

247
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,185
I DON'T CARE!

248
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,189
I CAN'T JUST TURN MY BACK
ON SOMEONE IF THEY NEED HELP!

249
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,692
EVEN IF‐‐EVEN IF IT MEANS
WE FAIL THE QUEST

250
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,778
AND EVEN IF ARUN GETS DESTROYED,

251
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,573
IF I GOT A CHANCE TO DO
SOME GOOD FOR SOMEONE, I WILL,

BUT I'M AFRAID I CANNOT LEAVE
THE CASTLE JUST YET.

270
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,871

RETRIEVE MY PEOPLE'S TREASURE,

FURTHER TO GO BEFORE THE END

WITH THE WAY THEY GOT
THIS DUNGEON LAID OUT,

296
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,607
THE FINAL BOSS ROOM
SHOULD BE DOWN THOSE STAIRS.

297
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,150
REMEMBER, HE'S THE LAST BOSS,

298
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,487
SO HE'S GONNA BE WAY STRONGER
THAN THE OTHER ONES.

299
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,156
WHEN YOU HIT HIM,
HIT FAST, AND HIT HARD.

SO NO ONE MOVES ON HIM
TILL I SAY.

00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,707
ONE LAST THING. IF YOU SEE
HIS GAUGE DROP TO YELLOW OR RED,

00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:26,806
AND AGREED TO BECOME MY WIFE?
(LAUGHS)

346
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:28,975
Klein: SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO MARRY YOU?

347
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:30,185
Thrmyr: YES, SHE IS.

348
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:33,313
THAT IS WHY
SHE CAME TO THIS CASTLE.

349
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:36,149
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MY DEAR?

350
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:38,485
HOWEVER, THE NIGHT BEFORE
OUR WEDDING BANQUET,

351
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:41,154
I CAUGHT HER SNIFFING AROUND
MY TREASURE VAULT.

352
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:45,158
AS PUNISHMENT,
I LOCKED HER IN A CAGE OF ICE.

353
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,660
(LAUGHS)

354
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:49,621
‐ Leafa: HEY, KAZUTO...
‐ Kirito: HMM?

355
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:51,289
Leafa: I KNOW THIS STORY.

356
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:53,708
I READ IT BEFORE,
THRMYR AND FREYJA,

357
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,003
A STOLEN TREASURE,
AND SOMETHING ELSE, TOO,

358
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:58,171
BUT WHAT?

359
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,465
Freyja: I WILL
NOT BECOME YOUR WIFE.

360
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:02,133
THESE WARRIORS AND I ARE HERE

361
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:04,594
TO PUT AN END
TO YOUR REIGN OF EVIL.

362
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:06,638
RETURN MY TREASURE IMMEDIATELY!

363
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,849
Thrmyr: YES,
THAT'S THE SPIRIT, MY LOVELY.

364
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:12,727
I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS
FROM THE WOMAN

365
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:16,022
WHOSE BEAUTY AND VALOR
ARE KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE LAND.

366
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,984
AND AS THEY SAY,
THE MORE NOBLE THE FLOWER,

367
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,319
THE MORE SATISFYING IT IS
TO PLUCK.

368
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:23,989
AFTER I'VE SNUFFED THE LIFE
FROM THESE INSECTS,

369
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,242
I SHALL SHOWER YOU
WITH EXTRA AFFECTION.

370
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:29,828
(CHUCKLING)

371
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,376
Klein: YOU BASTARD.

372
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:38,086
OVER MY DEAD BODY!

373
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:42,090
I, LORD KLEIN, WON'T LET YOU
LAY A FINGER ON LADY FREYJA!

374
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:43,967
Thrmyr: (CHUCKLES)

375
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,762
LISTEN TO THE ANGRY LITTLE FLY
BUZZING AWAY.

376
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:49,889
NOW, THEN, IT IS TIME

377
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:53,351
I BEGAN CELEBRATING
MY CONQUEST OF JOTUNHEIM.

378
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:56,396
I SHALL START
BY CRUSHING THE LIFE FROM YOU.

379
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:03,570
Kirito: HEH.

380
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:04,738
IT'S ON!

381
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:06,531
LISTEN TO YUI, GUYS!

382
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:08,199
DON'T ATTACK TILL SHE SAYS!

383
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:10,160
All: YOU GOT IT!
