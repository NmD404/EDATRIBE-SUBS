1
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,942
XeXeeD: THESE PLAYERS WHO THINK
IT'S ALL ABOUT THEIR AGILITY‐‐

2
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,402
(LAUGHS)
MAN, THEY'RE LIVIN' IN A DREAM.

3
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,280
I MEAN, SURE, FIRING SPEED
AND EVASION ARE IMPORTANT,

4
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,241
AND TIME WAS, IF YOU
ROCKED THOSE TWO THINGS,

5
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,285
IT'S ALL YOU NEEDED
TO BE THE BEST.

6
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,286
'TIL NOW, THAT IS.

7
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,913
YEAH, HATE TO SAY IT,

8
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,831
BUT IT DON'T WORK
LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,583
IN FACT, I GOT A MESSAGE
FOR THE FOLKS

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,252
WHO SPENT
THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS INDOORS

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,796
BOOSTING THEIR AGI.

12
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,298
SUCKS TO BE YOU RIGHT NOW,
DON'T IT?

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,134
‐ Crowd: (ANGRY SHOUTS, BOOING)
‐ Player: YOU SUCK!

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,011
Moderator: NOW THAT'S THE KIND
OF COMMENT WE'D EXPECT

15
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,138
FROM THE TOP PLAYER
OF "GUN GALE ONLINE,"

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,516
ONE OF THE MOST
CHALLENGING VRMMOs!

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,309
TALK ABOUT CONTROVERSIAL!

18
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,602
XeXeeD: I GUESS,
BUT WHO KNOWS

19
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,229
IF I'LL BE
ON "MMO STREAM" AGAIN,

20
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,981
SO MIGHT AS WELL STIR THINGS UP!

21
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,400
Moderator: OH, PLEASE!
SO, DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE A SHOT

22
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,901
IN THE UPCOMING
BULLET OF BULLETS?

23
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,195
XeXeeD: DAMN RIGHT, HONEY.
I WOULDN'T BE IN IT

24
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,155
IF I DIDN'T THINK
I COULD WIN IT!

25
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,116
Crowd: (BOOING)

26
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,743
Yamikaze: IT WON'T BE
THAT EASY, XEXEED.

27
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,621
THE B. o. B.'S A SOLO TOURNEY,
SO IT'S WAY DIFFERENT.

28
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,916
WHAT WORKED FOR YOU UP TO NOW,
DOESN'T MEAN IT'LL WORK AGAIN.

29
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,253
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T CHALK
MY WINS UP TO MY STATUS TYPE.

30
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,422
XeXeeD: YEAH, WELL,
IF ANYTHING, MY RESULTS

31
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,508
POINT TO SOME BIG CHANGES
HAPPENIN' IN "GGO."

32
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,552
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT AGI, YAMIKAZE.

33
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,429
GO FIGURE YOU'D BE IN DENIAL.

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,471
Yamikaze: (GROANS)

35
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,307
XeXeeD: WAKE UP, PEOPLE!

36
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,351
'TIL NOW, THE BEST STRATEGY
WAS BOOSTING YOUR AGI

37
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,895
AND SHOOTING A POWERFUL GUN
AS FAST AS YOU COULD,

38
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,480
BUT THE REALITY IS,

39
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,275
THE BALANCE OF GAME PLAY
IN AN MMO IS ALWAYS CHANGING,

40
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,943
ESPECIALLY IN GAMES
LIKE THIS ONE,

41
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,612
WITH LEVELS THAT DON'T LET YOU
RE‐SPEC YOUR STATS.

42
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,158
YOU HAVE TO THINK AHEAD AND BE
SMART WHEN USING YOUR POINTS,

43
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,243
'CAUSE THE BEST WEAPON
IN ONE LEVEL ZONE,

44
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,078
MIGHT NOT WORK FOR YOU
IN THE NEXT.

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,456
BESIDES, THE NEW GUNS COMIN' OUT

46
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,416
ARE GONNA HAVE
HIGHER STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS

47
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,001
AND ACCURACY BONUSES.

48
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,753
(CHUCKLES)

49
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,172
Player #2: (SCOFFS)
YOU REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS TALKING

50
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,674
'BOUT HOW GREAT
BEIN' AN AGI‐TYPE WAS?

51
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,552
THAT DICK TOTALLY SCAMMED US.

52
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,429
Players: (MURMURING)

53
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,477
Player #3: YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A FAKE, XEXEED,

54
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,522
AND NOW YOU'LL FACE JUDGMENT
FROM SOMEONE WITH REAL POWER.

55
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,611
Players: (LAUGHING)

56
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,289
XeXeeD: ALL I'M SAYIN' IS

57
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,832
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
IN THE END

58
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,753
IS THE PLAYER'S ABILITY TO‐‐
(GASPING)

59
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,762
Moderator: UH‐OH.

60
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,014
I GUESS WE HAVE
A BAD CONNECTION HERE.

61
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,517
DON'T WORRY, FOLKS.
I'M SURE HE'LL BE BACK SHORTLY.

62
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,978
STAY TUNED
FOR MORE "MMO STREAM."

63
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,023
Players: (GASPING)

64
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,860
Player #3: THIS IS REAL POWER,
REAL STRENGTH!

65
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:18,240
LET YOUR FEAR CARVE
ONE NAME INTO YOUR BRAINS...

66
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,826
THE NAME I SHARE
WITH THIS WEAPON...

67
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,828
DEATH GUN!

68
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,767
Asuna: DECEMBER SEVENTH, 2025.

69
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,395
HAS IT ALREADY BEEN A YEAR?

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,527
(GASPS)

71
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,616
I WONDER WHAT THE DIFFERENCE
IS BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD...

72
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,659
AND THE VIRTUAL.

73
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,829
Kirito: THE AMOUNT OF DATA.
THAT'S ALL.

74
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,248
Asuna: (GASPS)

75
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,000
YOU SCARED ME.

76
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,501
Kirito: SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

77
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,586
I'M ON TIME, THOUGH.

78
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,087
(GIGGLES) WHAT?

79
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,338
Asuna: (GIGGLES)

80
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,424
NO, I'M SORRY.
I WAS SPACING OUT.

81
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,675
ANYWAY...

82
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,386
HELLO, KIRITO.
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?!

83
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,766
Kirito: IT'S BEEN GOOD SO FAR,
BUT IT'S EVEN BETTER NOW.

84
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,642
Asuna: WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

85
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,978
Kirito: NOTHING! JUST...

86
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,813
THAT OUTFIT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

87
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,899
IT BRINGS BACK
A LOT OF MEMORIES.

88
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,817
Asuna: I GUESS IT DOES.

89
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,652
NO RAPIER, THOUGH.

90
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,697
LOOKS LIKE YOU WENT OVERBOARD
ON THE BLACK TODAY.

91
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,115
Kirito: YEAH!

92
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,201
SUGU THREW EVERYTHING
IN THE WASH THIS MORNING,

93
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,660
AND THIS IS ALL I HAD LEFT.

94
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,746
Asuna: THEN STOP
PUTTING YOUR LAUNDRY OFF.

95
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,290
‐ Kirito: (SIGHS)
‐ Asuna: (LAUGHS)

96
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,585
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE BOTH
DRESSED IN OUR OLD COLORS TODAY.

97
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,420
‐ WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT?
‐ Kirito: WELL...

98
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,923
IF WE SEE EACH OTHER
EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR, IT'S‐‐

99
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,716
Asuna: STOP. THAT WAS
A RHETORICAL QUESTION,

100
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,384
SMARTY‐PANTS. COME ON.

101
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,220
Kirito: OKAY, OKAY.

102
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,307
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

103
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,559
BUT I THINK THE IMPERIAL PALACE
IS INTERESTING.

104
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,104
Asuna: INTERESTING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

105
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,398
Kirito: IT'S TWO KILOMETERS
NORTH TO SOUTH,

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,150
1.5 EAST TO WEST,

107
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,444
AND IT TAKES UP
20% OF CHIYODA WARD.

108
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,780
THERE AREN'T ANY SUBWAYS
OR TUNNELS UNDER IT,

109
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,532
AND IT'S A NO‐FLY ZONE.

110
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,826
IT'S KINDA COOL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

111
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,410
I MEAN, IT'S THIS
BIG RESTRICTED AREA

112
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,496
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TOKYO.

113
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,374
NOT ONLY IS IT CUT OFF
FROM EVERYTHING PHYSICALLY,

114
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,251
BUT INFORMATION‐WISE AS WELL.

115
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,418
SEE THAT?

116
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,504
IT'S A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

117
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,632
THIS PLACE WAS SET UP WITH
ITS VERY OWN CLOSED NETWORK.

118
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,843
YOU CAN'T EVEN ACCESS IT
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

119
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,929
Asuna: WOW.
THAT'S A WEIRD‐LOOKING CAMERA.

120
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,222
Kirito: YEAH.

121
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,683
NOT ONLY IS THIS PLACE
THE HEART OF TOKYO,

122
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,018
BUT IT'S ALSO
AN ISOLATED WORLD OF ITS OWN.

123
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,646
MAYBE I'M EXAGGERATING
ITS COOL FACTOR.

124
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,690
‐ I GET LIKE THAT.
‐ Asuna: (GIGGLES) YOU THINK?

125
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,197
WOW!

126
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,867
Kirito: THIS USED TO BE
THE INNER CITADEL.

127
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,410
Asuna: COME ON! LET'S GO!

128
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,958
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

129
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,138
Asuna: HEY, YOU KNOW
THAT QUESTIONNAIRE

130
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,765
THEY GAVE US TO FILL OUT,
THE ONE ABOUT OUR FUTURE PLANS?

131
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,559
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO YET?

132
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,685
Kirito: HMM.

133
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,562
I GUESS, IF ANYTHING,

134
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,939
I WANNA GO FROM PLAYING GAMES
TO BEING A CREATOR.

135
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,608
Asuna: A CREATOR?

136
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,817
WHAT, FOR GAMES?

137
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,444
Kirito: NO, NOT FOR GAMES.

138
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,862
I WANNA MAKE
A HUMAN‐MACHINE INTERFACE

139
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,698
TO REPLACE THE FULL‐DIVE TECH
WE USE NOW.

140
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,199
I'VE BEEN GOIN'
TO ALL THESE TECH FORUMS

141
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,784
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT,

142
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,621
BUT IT'S A HECK OF A LOT
OF INFORMATION TO ABSORB.

143
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,667
Asuna: AFTER I GRADUATE,
ALL I WANT IS TO BE WITH YOU.

144
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,502
‐ Kirito: HUH?
‐ Asuna: I‐I MEAN...

145
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,920
I‐I WISH WE COULD
FIGURE OUT A WAY

146
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,131
TO LIVE WITH YUI
IN THIS WORLD, TOO!

147
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,258
Kirito: WE'LL BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH HER SOMEDAY,

148
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,593
AS SOON AS WE FIGURE OUT

149
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,762
HOW TO ACCESS AUGMENTED REALITY
AT WILL.

150
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,055
THE ONLY THING
STANDING IN THE WAY

151
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,890
IS THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE AMOUNT OF DATA.

152
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,018
Asuna: DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

153
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,436
THAT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN OUR WORLD

154
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,980
AND THE VIRTUAL
WAS THE AMOUNT OF DATA?

155
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,649
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, ANYWAY?

156
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,942
Kirito: LET'S SEE.
IT'S LIKE THIS.

157
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,403
IF WE WERE HOLDING HANDS
IN "A. L. O.,"

158
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,657
IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME
AS IN THE REAL WORLD, WOULD IT?

159
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,325
Asuna: NO, IT WOULDN'T.

160
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,245
YOU CAN FEEL A LOT MORE
TOUCHING A REAL HAND.

161
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,497
HEY, IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN

162
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,082
BY THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE AMOUNT OF DATA?

163
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,751
Kirito: YUP. AND CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

164
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,462
IF WE COULD REPRODUCE
THE FEEL OF SKIN AND A PULSE?

165
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,005
WOULD WE BE ABLE
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE

166
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,675
BETWEEN A REAL HAND
AND AN AVATAR'S HAND?

167
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,011
Asuna: I KNOW I COULD
IF I WAS TOUCHING YOUR HAND.

168
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,264
BUT IT'S NOT JUST TOUCH, IS IT?

169
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,517
I MEAN, IN THE REAL WORLD,
WE GET A LOT OF INFORMATION

170
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,727
FROM HOW SOMETHING SOUNDS
OR TASTES.

171
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,772
EVEN IF OUR AMUSPHERE RIGS
COULD ACCESS AUGMENTED REALITY,

172
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,357
WE'D STILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

173
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,610
Kirito: YEAH. THE SECOND
YOU SAW OR TOUCHED SOMETHING,

174
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,737
YOU'D KNOW
IF IT WAS REAL OR NOT.

175
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,823
BUT HOPEFULLY
SOMEONE'LL COME ALONG

176
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,117
AND MAKE
A TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH,

177
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,743
AND WHATEVER THAT IS,
IT'LL HAVE TO OUTPUT

178
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,830
A TON OF SENSORY DATA
ALL THE TIME.

179
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,623
Asuna: THEN WE COULD
BREAK DOWN THE WALL

180
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,000
BETWEEN BOTH WORLDS
AND BE WITH YUI FOREVER.

181
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,294
DO YOU THINK THAT DAY
WILL EVER COME FOR US?

182
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,921
Kirito: YEAH.

183
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,382
Asuna: THEN GET TO WORK
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN, 'KAY?

184
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,591
Kirito: OKAY.

185
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,114
Waiter: WELCOME, SIR.

186
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,909
Kikuoka: HEY, KIRITO!

187
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,911
OVER HERE! (CHUCKLING)

188
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,421
Kikuoka: GO AHEAD.
ORDER WHATEVER YOU WANT.

189
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,048
IT'S ON ME.

190
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,050
Kirito: THANK YOU, SIR.
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.

191
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,677
Kikuoka: COME ON. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SO FORMAL WITH ME.

192
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,180
RELAX, AND TALK TO ME
LIKE YOU WOULD IN "A. L. O."

193
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,432
Kirito: OKAY. IF YOU SAY SO.

194
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,060
THEN I GUESS I'LL...

195
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,561
(GASPS)

196
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,690
(GROANS)

197
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,651
I'D LIKE
THE PARFAIT AU CHOCOLAT,

198
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,904
THE FRAMBOISE MILLE‐FEUILLE,

199
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,530
AND A HAZELNUT LATTE.

200
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,116
‐ (SIGHS)
‐ Kikuoka: SORRY TO MAKE YOU

201
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,826
COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE,
KIRITO.

202
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,328
Kirito: IF YOU'RE
THAT SORRY ABOUT IT,

203
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,246
WHY'D YOU ASK ME
TO COME TO GINZA?

204
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,581
OH, AND DO YOU THINK

205
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,084
YOU CAN NOT CALL ME
BY THAT NAME IN PUBLIC?

206
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,877
Kikuoka: WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE ATTITUDE?

207
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,046
I THOUGHT WE WERE BUDS.

208
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,882
I WAS THE FIRST TO VISIT YOU
IN THE HOSPITAL, REMEMBER?

209
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,550
Kirito: (SIGHS)

210
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,720
Kirito: HE'S RIGHT.
WHEN I CAME TO,

211
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,014
THE FIRST ONE THERE
WASN'T MY FAMILY.

212
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,100
IT WAS THE LEADER
OF THE TASK FORCE,

213
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,520
SEIJIROU KIKUOKA
FROM THE TECH BUREAU

214
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,606
AT THE MINISTRY OF INTERNAL
AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS,

215
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,527
A.K.A. THE VIRTUAL REALITY
SECTION.

216
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,570
Kikuoka: (HUMMING)

217
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,032
Kirito: SO WHAT'D YOU
WANNA SEE ME ABOUT?

218
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,700
IF IT'S ANYTHING
"S. A. O." RELATED,

219
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,953
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW.

220
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,996
Kikuoka: ACTUALLY,
I WANNA TALK TO YOU

221
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,374
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

222
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,917
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT.

223
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,503
Kirito: WHO'S HE?

224
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,172
Kikuoka: THIS WON'T BE PLEASANT.

225
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,008
SO LAST MONTH,
ON NOVEMBER THE 14TH...

226
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,053
THE LANDLORD OF AN APARTMENT
COMPLEX IN NAKANO, TOKYO,

227
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,555
NOTICED A FOUL ODOR
WHILE CLEANING.

228
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,849
IT WAS COMING
FROM ONE OF THE UNITS,

229
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,560
SO HE DISABLED THE LOCK
AND DISCOVERED THIS MAN DEAD.

230
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,980
HIS NAME WAS TAMOTSU SHIGEMURA,
AND HE WAS 26.

231
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,232
HE'D BEEN DEAD FOR FIVE DAYS.

232
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,900
THEY FOUND HIM IN BED.

233
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,153
HIS PLACE WAS A MESS,
BUT NO SIGNS OF BURGLARY.

234
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,321
HE HAD SOMETHING INTERESTING
ON HIS HEAD, THOUGH.

235
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,740
Kirito: AN AMUSPHERE?

236
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,535
Kikuoka: YEAH. IT WAS RULED
AN UNNATURAL DEATH,

237
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,120
SO THEY DID AN AUTOPSY.

238
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,456
THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS FOUND
TO BE ACUTE HEART FAILURE.

239
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,250
Kirito: WAIT. HEART FAILURE?

240
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,085
YOU MEAN HIS HEART STOPPED?

241
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,378
THEY FIND OUT WHY?

242
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,754
Kikuoka: NO, THEY DIDN'T.

243
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,716
Waiter: HERE YOU ARE, SIR.

244
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,555
Kikuoka: UNFORTUNATELY,
SINCE SO MUCH TIME HAD PASSED

245
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,391
SINCE HIS DEATH AND FOUL PLAY
WAS RULED OUT AS THE CAUSE,

246
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,435
THE AUTOPSY
WASN'T VERY THOROUGH.

247
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,854
WE DO KNOW HE'D BEEN LOGGED IN
FOR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT

248
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,981
AND HADN'T EATEN ANYTHING
THE WHOLE TIME.

249
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,567
Kirito: WELL,
THAT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL.

250
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,485
PLAYERS DO IT ALL THE TIME.

251
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,279
WAIT. WHY ARE YOU TELLIN' ME
ABOUT THIS?

252
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,114
Kikuoka: HE HAD A GAME
INSTALLED ON HIS SYSTEM

253
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,783
CALLED "GUN GALE ONLINE."
YOU KNOW THAT ONE?

254
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,493
Kirito: YEAH. "GGO."

255
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,455
IT'S THE ONLY MMO IN JAPAN
WITH PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS.

256
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,832
Kikuoka: THIS PAST OCTOBER,
THERE WAS A TOURNAMENT

257
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,877
TO DECIDE THE MOST POWERFUL
PLAYER IN "GGO."

258
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,171
THE DECEASED
WAS THE GUY WHO WON IT.

259
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,381
HIS CHARACTER'S NAME WAS XEXEED.

260
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,218
Kirito: WAS HE PLAYING "GGO"
WHEN HE DIED?

261
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,845
Kikuoka: NO. WHEN IT HAPPENED,
HE WAS APPEARING

262
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,724
ON A SHOW CALLED "MMO STREAM"
AS XEXEED'S AVATAR.

263
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,893
WE KNOW THE TIME FROM THE LOGS.

264
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,813
THIS NEXT BIT OF INFO
STILL NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED.

265
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,607
ACCORDING TO
ANOTHER PLAYER'S BLOG,

266
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,859
AT THE SAME TIME SHIGEMURA
HAD THE HEART ATTACK,

267
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,237
SOMETHING STRANGE
HAPPENED IN "GGO."

268
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,571
Kirito: WHAT?

269
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,448
Kikuoka: SOME PLAYERS
WERE AT A BAR IN‐GAME

270
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,533
WATCHING THE SHOW, WHEN ONE
OF THE PLAYERS STOOD UP

271
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,036
AND STARTED ACTING ERRATICALLY.

272
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,497
THE BLOG STATES
THE PLAYER WAS SHOUTING STUFF

273
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,541
ABOUT "JUDGMENT" AND "POWER"
AT XEXEED'S IMAGE ON THE TV

274
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,085
AND THEN FIRED HIS GUN AT IT.

275
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,545
AT THE TIME,
ANOTHER PLAYER IN THE BAR

276
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,589
HAPPENED TO BE RECORDING AUDIO.

277
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,175
HE UPLOADED IT TO A VIDEO SITE.

278
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:43,429
SINCE THE FILE HAD A JAPAN
STANDARD TIME COUNTER EMBEDDED,

279
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,641
WE KNOW THAT THE SHOT FIRED
AT THE TV AND SHIGEMURA'S AVATAR

280
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,727
DISAPPEARING FROM THE SHOW
HAPPENED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME.

281
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,272
Kirito: PROBABLY
JUST COINCIDENCE.

282
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,982
Kikuoka: THERE WAS
ANOTHER DEATH, THOUGH.

283
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,191
Kirito: WHAT?

284
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,236
THIS ONE HAPPENED
ON NOVEMBER THE 28TH

285
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,781
SOMEWHERE IN SAITAMA PREFECTURE,
SAME SETUP AS BEFORE.

286
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,409
THE DECEASED WAS FOUND
IN THEIR APARTMENT.

287
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,203
A GUY DELIVERING THE NEWSPAPER
HAPPENED TO LOOK IN THE WINDOW.

288
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,998
HE SAW THE VICTIM LYING IN BED
WEARING AN AMUSPHERE RIG,

289
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,207
SAID THE SMELL WAS...

290
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,710
‐ Woman: (COUGHING)
‐ Woman #2: AHEM!

291
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,212
Kikuoka: LET'S SKIP THE DETAILS
OF THE CORPSE'S CONDITION.

292
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,173
ANYWAY, HEART FAILURE
WAS THE CAUSE OF DEATH.

293
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,135
THE VICTIM WAS ALSO
A TOP‐RANKING "GGO" PLAYER.

294
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,845
HIS CHARACTER'S NAME WAS...

295
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,473
USUSHIO TARAKO? WELL,
HE WAS PLAYING WHEN HE DIED.

296
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,351
IT HAPPENED IN THE CENTRAL PLAZA
IN GLOCKEN.

297
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,813
HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF A MEETING WITH HIS "SQUAD."

298
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,690
I GUESS THAT'S
THE SAME AS A GUILD.

299
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,234
A STRANGE PLAYER WENT UP TO HIM

300
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,652
AND SHOT HIM, POINT‐BLANK.

301
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,279
Kirito: DO YOU KNOW

302
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,073
IF IT WAS THE SAME GUY
WHO SHOT XEXEED?

303
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,366
Kikuoka: MOST LIKELY.

304
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,326
HE SAID STUFF
ABOUT JUDGMENT AND POWER

305
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,121
AND THEN IDENTIFIED HIMSELF
WITH THE SAME CHARACTER NAME.

306
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,164
Kirito: WHAT NAME?

307
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,875
Kikuoka: DEATH GUN.

308
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,254
Kirito: DEATH...GUN?

309
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,556
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE BOTH
VICTIMS DIED FROM HEART FAILURE?

310
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,475
Kikuoka: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

311
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,269
Kirito: WAS THERE ANY DAMAGE
TO THEIR BRAINS?

312
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,606
Kikuoka: I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT THAT, TOO,

313
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,192
SO I ASKED THE CORONER
IF HE FOUND ANY TRACE OF DAMAGE

314
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,944
TO EITHER OF THEIR BRAINS,
AND HE SAID THEY WERE BOTH FINE.

315
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:26,324
BESIDES, THE NERVEGEAR RIG
USED HIGH‐OUTPUT MICROWAVES

316
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,284
POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO FRY THE SIGNAL ELEMENTS

317
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,952
AND DESTROY THE BRAIN.

318
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,121
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THE AMUSPHERE RIG WAS DESIGNED

319
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,289
SO THAT IT COULDN'T EMIT

320
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,041
ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
THAT POWERFUL.

321
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,085
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT
THE DEVELOPERS CLAIM.

322
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,254
Kirito: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS
HAVE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK,

323
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,340
BUT EVEN SO, YOUR STORY'S

324
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,008
BUILT AROUND COINCIDENCE
AND RUMORS.

325
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,886
Kikuoka: TRUE. IT COULD BE
A COINCIDENCE OR EVEN A HOAX.

326
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,262
I'M NOT SOLD EITHER WAY.

327
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,265
FOR NOW‐‐AND THIS IS
HYPOTHETICAL, MIND YOU‐‐

328
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,601
DO YOU THINK IT'S EVEN
REMOTELY POSSIBLE

329
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,603
TO STOP A PLAYER'S HEART
IN THE REAL WORLD

330
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,189
WITH VIRTUAL BULLETS
FROM A VIRTUAL GUN?

331
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,164
Kirito: (GASPS)

332
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,168
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

333
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,963
BUT HYPOTHETICALLY
LET'S SAY THIS DEATH GUN

334
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,340
DID SEND SOME KIND
OF KILLER SIGNAL TO XEXEED

335
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,759
AND THAT TARAKO GUY'S
AMUSPHERES.

336
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,136
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

337
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,180
COULD THE SENSATION OF A TOUCH
STOP A HEART?

338
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,641
MAYBE A TASTE OR SMELL,

339
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,017
A SIGHT, A SOUND,

340
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,562
OR SOME OTHER SENSATION.

341
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,313
‐ Kikuoka: (CHUCKLES)
‐ Kirito: HUH?

342
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,234
OKAY, WHOA. YOU ALREADY THOUGHT
OF THIS, HAVEN'T YOU?

343
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,571
OH, I GET IT, YOU AND YOUR TEAM
CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT,

344
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,198
SO YOU INVITE ME FOR COFFEE
TO PICK MY BRAIN?

345
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,825
Kikuoka: NO!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

346
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,994
I‐I'D NEVER DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT TO YOU, HONEST.

347
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,955
I LIKE TALKING TO YOU
AND JUST WANTED YOUR OPINION.

348
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:56,956
Kirito: WE'RE DONE.

349
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,333
YOU WANT MY OPINION, HERE IT IS.

350
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,793
YOU CAN'T STOP A PLAYER'S HEART

351
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,087
IN THE REAL WORLD
BY ACTIONS IN‐GAME.

352
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,922
SHOTS FIRED AND THE HEART
ATTACKS ARE COINCIDENCES.

353
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,132
Kikuoka: WAIT! HOLD ON!

354
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,550
LISTEN, YOU CAN ORDER
SOMETHING ELSE!

355
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,385
JUST SIT DOWN,
AND HANG OUT FOR A BIT.

356
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,137
PLEASE.

357
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,472
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW RELIEVED I AM

358
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,974
TO HEAR YOU PUT IT INTO WORDS.

359
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,643
FACT IS,
I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU.

360
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,270
I DON'T BELIEVE THESE TWO DEATHS

361
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,148
WERE CAUSED
BY IN‐GAME GUNSHOTS EITHER.

362
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,026
AND NOW THAT WE'VE TALKED,
I WANT TO ASK YOU OFFICIALLY.

363
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,237
WOULD YOU LOG IN TO "GUN GALE
ONLINE" AND MAKE CONTACT

364
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,032
WITH THE PLAYER
CALLING HIMSELF DEATH GUN?

365
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,993
Kirito: AND ONCE I DO
FIND THE GUY, THEN WHAT?

366
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,870
YOU WANT ME TO GET SHOT?
IS THAT IT?

367
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,997
‐ Kikuoka: WHOA, NOW. COME ON.
‐ Kirito: WELL, SCREW THAT!

368
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,333
‐ I DON'T WANNA GET KILLED!
‐ (CUPS RATTLE)

369
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,918
Kikuoka: THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

370
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,086
WE JUST AGREED IT WASN'T,
DIDN'T WE?!

371
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,838
BESIDES, THIS DEATH GUN GUY

372
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,632
IS ONLY GOING
AFTER SPECIFIC TARGETS!

373
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,175
THEY HAVE TO MEET HIS CRITERIA!

374
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,302
‐ Kirito: CRITERIA?
‐ Kikuoka: UH‐HUH!

375
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,304
HERE'S THE DEAL.

376
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,223
XEXEED AND USUSHIO TARAKO

377
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,100
WEREN'T JUST ANY OLD PLAYERS.
THEY WERE TOP RANKED,

378
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,062
SO IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
HE'S NOT INTERESTED IN NEWBIES.

379
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,271
BUT IF YOU WERE STRONG ENOUGH

380
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,898
TO BEAT KAYABA
AT HIS OWN GAME, THEN‐‐

381
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,274
Kirito: THAT'S DIFFERENT!

382
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,609
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE HEARD,

383
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,152
BUT "GGO"
IS NO WALK IN THE PARK!

384
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,237
IT'S FILLED WITH PRO GAMERS!

385
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,738
Kikuoka: HOLD THE PHONE!

386
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,115
YOU SAID, "PRO GAMER."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, "PRO"?

387
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,785
Kirito: IT MEANS PROFESSIONAL,
LITERALLY.

388
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,787
"GUN GALE ONLINE"
IS THE ONLY VIRTUAL MMO

389
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,164
WITH A GAME‐COIN
TO REAL‐CURRENCY

390
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,875
‐ CONVERSION SYSTEM IN PLACE.
‐ Kikuoka: WHAT?

391
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,835
Kirito: IT MEANS WHATEVER MONEY
YOU EARN IN THE GAME

392
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,838
GETS PAID BACK TO YOU IN COLD,
HARD CASH IN THE REAL WORLD.

393
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,841
BEIN' A PRO MEANS YOU HAVE
A CONSTANT STREAM OF INCOME

394
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,969
FROM THE GAME
COMIN' IN EVERY MONTH,

395
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,054
AND IF YOU'RE A TOP PLAYER,
THAT MEANS MONTHLY

396
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,847
YOU'RE MAKING
TWO TO THREE HUNDRED THOU.

397
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,517
IT'S AN AWESOME GIG.

398
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,979
THAT'S WHY THE HIGH‐LEVEL GUYS
IN "GGO" ARE SO HARDCORE.

399
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,814
THEY POUR MORE TIME
AND PASSION INTO IT

400
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,233
THAN PLAYERS FROM OTHER MMOS.

401
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,235
SOMEONE LIKE ME
CAN'T JUST LOG IN

402
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,779
AND MATCH PLAYERS LIKE THAT.
YOU SHOULD FIND SOMEONE ELSE‐‐

403
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,239
Kikuoka: WHOA,
HOLD IT! HOLD IT!

404
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,740
WHO ELSE AM I GONNA FIND?
YOU'RE IT!

405
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,909
I NEED YOUR HELP
IN THIS INVESTIGATION,

406
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,745
AND IF TAKING THESE PROS ON
IS GOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL,

407
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,706
I CAN PAY YOU THIS MUCH.

408
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,708
Kirito: (GULPS)

409
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,751
I DON'T GET WHY
YOU'RE SO HUNG UP ON THIS.

410
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,421
YOU FIND HORROR STORIES
LIKE THESE ALL THE TIME ONLINE.

411
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,840
Kikuoka: YEAH, I KNOW.

412
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,633
BUT STILL, IT'S GOT
MY BOSSES WORRIED.

413
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,137
THE EFFECT OF FULL‐DIVE
TECHNOLOGY ON THE REAL WORLD

414
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,430
IS THE HOTTEST TOPIC TODAY.

415
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,057
LITERALLY EVERYONE'S
RESEARCHING IT.

416
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,268
Kikuoka: PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO TRY TO USE THESE DEATHS

417
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,894
TO REGULATE THE TECHNOLOGY.

418
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,147
WE WANT TO KNOW THE FACTS
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

419
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,274
WE WANT TO BE SURE.

420
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,735
THAT'S WHY WE'RE INTERESTED.

421
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,321
Kirito: YOU GUYS COULD JUST GO
DIRECTLY TO THE ADMINS ABOUT IT.

422
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,448
Kikuoka: RIGHT, BUT ZASKAR,

423
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,826
THE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED
AND HOSTS "GGO," IS IN THE U. S.

424
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,287
THEIR ADDRESS,
PHONE NUMBER, AND EMAIL,

425
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,832
NONE OF IT'S BEEN MADE PUBLIC,
SO WE CAN'T CONTACT THEM.

426
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,043
EVER SINCE THE SEED
WAS RELEASED,

427
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,587
ALL KINDS OF SHADY VR WORLDS
HAVE POPPED UP.

428
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,088
Kirito: YEAH.

429
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,757
Kikuoka: MAYBE THEY'RE LEGIT,

430
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,217
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT, BUT IF WE
WANT TO FIND ANYTHING OUT,

431
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,471
THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO TRY
CONTACTING THEM IN THE GAME.

432
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,306
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO GET SHOT.

433
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,059
WE'LL TAKE WHATEVER
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WE HAVE TO.

434
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,062
JUST EVALUATE THE SITUATION,
AND REPORT BACK.

435
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,897
SO WILL YOU HELP US, OR WHAT?

436
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,110
Kirito: FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE...

437
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,655
DIED IN AINCRAD.

438
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,073
IT'S BEEN A YEAR,

439
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,159
AND FINALLY THOSE MEMORIES
ARE STARTING TO FADE.

440
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:25,581
BUT NOW MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING
IN ANOTHER VIRTUAL WORLD,

441
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,583
AND I'M GETTING PULLED BACK IN.

442
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,420
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE
DOESN'T WANT ME TO EVER FORGET.

443
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:39,053
Asuna: OHH. NOW I GET IT.

444
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,181
I THINK I FIGURED OUT
WHY YOU BROUGHT ME HERE TODAY.

445
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,641
Kirito: OH. YOU DID, HUH?

446
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,017
Asuna: MM‐HMM.

447
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,270
IF OUR WORLD IS MADE UP
OF AN AXIS CALLED TIME

448
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,273
AND A PLANE CALLED SPACE,
THEN THE CENTER OF OUR REALITY

449
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,151
IS THIS PLACE
IN THE HEART OF TOKYO

450
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,986
WHERE A CASTLE USED TO STAND.

451
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,490
AND THE AXIS OF ALL THE VIRTUAL
WORLDS POPPING UP NOW,

452
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,576
THANKS TO THE SEED, IS A PLACE
THAT ALSO HAD A CASTLE ONCE,

453
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,120
AINCRAD.

454
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,415
THAT'S WHY THIS SUNSET
FEELS SO NOSTALGIC NOW.

455
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,128
Kirito: YOU'RE RIGHT. IT DOES.

456
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,629
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU JUST SAID

457
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,131
HELPED ME FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, TOO.

458
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,507
Asuna: HUH? REALLY?

459
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,634
Kirito: YOU REMEMBER
WHAT AINCRAD LOOKED LIKE?

460
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,637
WELL, MAYBE ITS SHAPE
WAS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT

461
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,724
THE AXIS OF TIME
AND THE PLANE OF SPACE.

462
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,102
Asuna: MAYBE, BUT IF ITS
VERTICAL AXIS REPRESENTED TIME

463
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,979
AND ITS FLOORS SPACE,

464
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,273
THEN THE COMMANDER MADE A WORLD
THAT TAPERED TO NOTHING.

465
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,941
EVERYTHING ENDED
ONCE YOU REACHED THE TOP.

466
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:38,195
UNFORTUNATELY, A CERTAIN SOMEONE
DESTROYED IT HALFWAY UP.

467
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,905
NOW WE'LL NEVER KNOW
HOW IT ENDED.

468
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,616
Kirito: YES, MA'AM!
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MA'AM!

469
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,579
Both: (LAUGHING)

470
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,459
Kirito: ASUNA, LISTEN. I‐‐

471
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,626
Asuna: WHAT?

472
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,547
Kirito: NAH.
HEY, IT'S GETTIN' COLD.

473
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,798
YOU WANNA
START HEADIN' BACK NOW?

474
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,675
Asuna: MM‐HMM.
OH, AND NEXT TIME WE COME,

475
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,469
LET'S BRING LIZ AND LEAFA
AND THE OTHERS.

476
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,803
WOULDN'T IT BE FUN

477
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,764
TO GET EVERYONE TOGETHER
FOR A PICNIC HERE?

478
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,767
Kirito: YEAH, IT WOULD,
ESPECIALLY IN SPRINGTIME.

479
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,491
Man: I'M IN POSITION.

480
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,075
Woman: ROGER.

481
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,162
TARGETS HAVEN'T CHANGED
THEIR COURSE OR THEIR SPEED.

482
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,830
THEY'RE FOUR HUNDRED METERS
FROM YOU,

483
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,582
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FROM ME.

484
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,126
Man: PRETTY FAR.
CAN YOU MAKE THE SHOT?

485
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,461
Woman: NO SWEAT.

486
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,546
Man: OKAY, THEN.
FIRE WHEN READY.

487
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,840
‐ I'M COUNTING ON YOU, SINON.
‐ Sinon: ROGER.

488
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,263
THIS PRESSURE...

489
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,390
THIS ANXIETY...

490
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,600
THIS FEAR.

491
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,144
FIFTEEN HUNDRED METERS?

492
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,646
THAT'S NOTHING,

493
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,315
LIKE TOSSING A WAD OF PAPER
INTO A TRASH CAN.

494
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,735
NO WAY.

495
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,446
THIS IS NOTHING
LIKE HOW IT FELT THAT DAY.

496
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,085
NEXT.
