1
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,948
Asuna: (GASPS)

2
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,705
Siune: ASUNA.

3
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,291
Asuna: (GASPS) SIUNE.

4
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,544
PLEASE, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO YUUKI?

5
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,421
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS,
AND SHE HASN'T LOGGED BACK IN.

6
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,215
Siune: IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

7
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:51,551
NONE OF US HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO CONTACT HER EITHER.

8
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,929
ASUNA, I HATE TO SAY THIS,

9
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,182
BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

10
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,601
I THINK SHE'S DOING IT
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

11
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,645
Asuna: (GASPS) BUT WHY?

12
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,319
I HAD A FEELING
SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.

13
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,155
I COULD TELL
EVERYONE IN THE GROUP

14
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,116
WAS AVOIDING
GETTING TOO CLOSE TO ME.

15
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,911
THE LAST THING I WANT
IS TO UPSET ANYONE

16
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,705
OR BE A NUISANCE.

17
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:24,209
BUT STILL, I DON'T SEE HOW ANY
OF THIS COULD BE FOR MY SAKE!

18
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,877
Siune: YOU'RE NOT A NUISANCE!

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,755
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY

20
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,133
WE'RE ALL TRULY HAPPY
TO HAVE MET YOU.

21
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,927
WE GOT TO HAVE
ONE LAST AMAZING MEMORY

22
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,848
OF OUR TIME TOGETHER HERE,
AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU.

23
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,976
AND YUUKI,
I KNOW SHE'S GRATEFUL, TOO,

24
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,146
BUT PLEASE,
FORGET YOU EVER MET US.

25
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,233
IT REALLY IS THE BEST THING
FOR YOU AND FOR YUUKI.

26
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,111
Asuna: I CAN'T EVER SEE
ANY OF YOU AGAIN?

27
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,406
I THOUGHT
AFTER THE GUILD WAS GONE,

28
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,326
I THOUGHT WE COULD AT LEAST
KEEP ON BEING FRIENDS,

29
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,494
BUT THIS WHOLE TIME,

30
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,204
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO THOUGHT THAT?

31
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,082
Siune: I'M SORRY.

32
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,086
Asuna: NO, WAIT!

33
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,879
Lisbeth: ASUNA!

34
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,798
MORNING.

35
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,258
Silica: MORNING, ASUNA.

36
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,384
Asuna: GOOD MORNING.

37
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,470
Lisbeth: AH,
WE FINALLY CAUGHT YOU.

38
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,888
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HERE,

39
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,015
SO YOU GONNA TELL US
WHAT THAT MESSAGE WAS ABOUT?

40
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,349
Silica: IS IT TRUE?

41
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,185
LIZ SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU JOINING A GUILD.

42
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,561
‐ Asuna: (GASPS)
‐ Lisbeth: COME ON.

43
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,480
COME ON, TELL US. ARE THEY COOL?

44
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,606
Asuna: WELL, IT'S LIKE‐‐

45
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,065
(RINGTONE CHIMING)

46
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,942
OH, HANG ON A SEC.

47
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,737
HUH?

48
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,990
Kirito: ALL RIGHT, HOW'S THAT?

49
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,784
CAN YOU SEE MY FACE OKAY?

50
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,703
Yui: I SEE YOU,
BUT YOU'RE A LITTLE BLURRY.

51
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,331
Kirito: HMM.
IT'S THE AUTOFOCUS AGAIN.

52
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,832
IT'S GOTTA BE THAT.

53
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,459
GIVE ME A SEC, YUI.

54
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,502
Yui: OKAY, DADDY.

55
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,181
Kirito: HEY.

56
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,066
THIS ZEKKEN,
YOU STILL WANT TO SEE HER?

57
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,317
Asuna: (GASPS)

58
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,945
MM‐HMM.

59
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,280
Kirito: EVEN AFTER THEY SAY
IT'S BETTER YOU DIDN'T,

60
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,281
YOU STILL DO?

61
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,282
Asuna: MM‐HMM.

62
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,784
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY.

63
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,537
ALL I WANT IS TO TALK
TO YUUKI ONE LAST TIME.

64
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,038
I CAN'T LEAVE IT LIKE THIS.

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,373
Kirito: OKAY.

66
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,711
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE FOUND
WHERE SHE'S AT.

67
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,172
I'M NOT SURE,
BUT IT'S THE BEST I GOT.

68
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,174
Asuna: WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SHE'D BE HERE?

69
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,301
Kirito: THAT PLACE HAS
A MEDICUBOID.

70
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,638
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES DOING
THE CLINICAL TRIALS FOR IT.

71
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,932
Asuna: MEDICUBOID?

72
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,152
EXCUSE ME.

73
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,237
Receptionist: MAY I HELP YOU?

74
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,572
Asuna: YES.

75
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,575
I, UM‐‐I THINK
I'M LOOKING FOR A PATIENT.

76
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,034
Receptionist: UH...

77
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,537
Asuna: WELL, SHE'S ABOUT
15 YEARS OLD OR SO.

78
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,415
I THINK HER NAME MIGHT BE YUUKI,
BUT I'M NOT SURE.

79
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,333
Receptionist:
I NEED A NAME AT LEAST.

80
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,295
Asuna: OH. UM, WELL, I THINK
SHE MIGHT BE THE PATIENT

81
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,131
WHO'S TESTING
THAT MEDICUBOID THING.

82
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,465
Second receptionist:
PARDON ME, MISS.

83
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,466
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

84
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,051
Asuna: UH, OH, SORRY.

85
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,928
MY NAME IS ASUNA YUUKI.

86
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,263
Second receptionist: (GASPS)

87
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,056
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

88
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,725
I'LL GET SOMEONE RIGHT AWAY.

89
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,851
Asuna: UM, SURE.

90
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,690
(FOOTSTEPS)

91
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,192
Doctor: HI. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

92
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,194
I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN WAITING LONG.

93
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,654
Asuna: NO, NOT AT ALL.

94
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,780
Doctor: THAT'S GOOD.

95
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,574
THEY TOLD ME YOU'RE ASUNA YUUKI.

96
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,742
Asuna: YES.

97
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,619
Doctor: GREAT.
I'M DR. KURAHASHI.

98
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,787
I'M YUUKI KONNO'S
PRIMARY PHYSICIAN.

99
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,789
Asuna: YUUKI KONNO.

100
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,045
Dr. Kurahashi: YOU KNOW,

101
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,254
I'M SURPRISED YOU EVEN FOUND US.

102
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,631
Asuna: WHY?

103
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,466
Dr. Kurahashi: OH,
WELL, WE KEEP A LOW PROFILE.

104
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,259
THAT SAID, YUUKI WARNED ME
SOMEONE CALLED ASUNA

105
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,720
MIGHT TRY AND PAY HER A VISIT
AT SOME POINT.

106
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,888
Asuna: SHE WARNED YOU?

107
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,640
Dr. Kurahashi: UH‐HUH.
SHE ALSO SAID

108
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,558
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHERE SHE WAS,

109
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,226
SO I SAID,
"DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT."

110
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,853
SHE'S NOT GONNA FIND YOU HERE."

111
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,566
WHEN RECEPTION TOLD ME
YOU WERE IN THE LOBBY,

112
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,942
I WAS SHOCKED.

113
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,612
Asuna: DOCTOR, HAS YUUKI
TOLD YOU ANYTHING ELSE

114
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,614
ABOUT ME OR HOW WE MET?

115
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,282
Dr. Kurahashi: I'LL SAY SHE HAS.

116
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,118
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH
THE ONLY PERSON SHE TALKS ABOUT.

117
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,580
ALTHOUGH, IT SEEMS
WHENEVER YUUKI DOES MENTION YOU,

118
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,582
SHE ALWAYS ENDS UP IN TEARS.

119
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,000
Asuna: (GASPS)

120
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,252
Dr. Kurahashi: SHE'S ALWAYS
BEEN A BRAVE GIRL

121
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,088
AND NEVER FELT SORRY
FOR HERSELF.

122
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,631
SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU,

123
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,342
BUT SHE CAN'T BRING HERSELF
TO DO IT.

124
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,928
Asuna: YES, I KNOW,

125
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,263
AND I STILL CAN'T WRAP
MY HEAD AROUND IT.

126
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,975
A FRIEND OF HERS TOLD ME IN‐GAME
THAT IT WAS FOR MY OWN GOOD.

127
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:56,976
WHY IS THAT?

128
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,020
WHY CAN'T WE SEE EACH OTHER?

129
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,820
Dr. Kurahashi: FOR STARTERS,

130
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,739
I SHOULD TELL YOU
WHAT THE MEDICUBOID IS ABOUT.

131
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,032
Asuna: OKAY.

132
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,576
Dr. Kurahashi:
MEDICUBOID IS THE CODE NAME

133
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,246
FOR THE WORLD'S FIRST
MEDICAL FULL‐DIVE MACHINE.

134
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,956
IT'S SO REVOLUTIONARY,

135
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,666
THE GOVERNMENT'S
BACKING ITS DEVELOPMENT.

136
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,960
Asuna: IT'S A FULL‐DIVE RIG
FOR HOSPITALS?

137
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,961
Dr. Kurahashi: UH‐HUH.

138
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,379
FOR EXAMPLE,

139
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,131
LET'S SAY YOU WERE A PATIENT

140
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,216
WITH A VISUAL
OR HEARING DISABILITY.

141
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,885
THIS MACHINE
CAN GIVE YOU BACK THOSE SENSES.

142
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,637
YOU KNOW HOW
WITH THE AMUSPHERE RIG

143
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,307
IMAGES AND SOUNDS GET SENT
DIRECTLY TO YOUR BRAIN?

144
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,019
WELL, TRANSMITTING SIGNALS
ISN'T ALL IT DOES.

145
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,855
THE AMUSPHERE HAS THE ABILITY

146
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,023
TO CANCEL OUT
PHYSICAL SENSATIONS, TOO.

147
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,277
BACK HERE, IT HITS THAT SPOT
WITH ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES,

148
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,779
SO IT TEMPORARILY
NUMBS THE NERVES.

149
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,615
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A GENERAL ANESTHETIC.

150
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,577
Asuna: OKAY, BUT HOW IS THAT
USEFUL FOR HOSPITALS?

151
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,164
THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH
THE AMUSPHERE CAN BLOCK OUT.

152
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,583
WHAT HAPPENS IF A PATIENT'S
IN SERIOUS PAIN?

153
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,709
Dr. Kurahashi: EXACTLY.

154
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,878
YOU HIT THE NAIL
RIGHT ON THE HEAD.

155
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,254
THE AMUSPHERE CAN'T DO IT.

156
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,173
EVEN THE NERVEGEAR
CAN'T BLOCK PAIN

157
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,799
FROM SURGERY OR CHRONIC ILLNESS.

158
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,762
HOWEVER, THE MEDICUBOID ENHANCES
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE.

159
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,098
PLUS IT'S BUILT INTO THE BED,
SO THERE'S MORE COVERAGE,

160
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,600
THE BRAIN, SPINE, EVERYTHING.

161
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,351
ONCE IT GETS ON THE MARKET,

162
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,271
IT'LL CHANGE THE COURSE
OF MEDICINE AS WE KNOW IT.

163
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,898
THE MEDICUBOID
HAS INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL.

164
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,567
YOU COULD, SAY,
PAIR IT WITH A CAMERA

165
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,319
AND GIVE IT AN A. R. FUNCTION.

166
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,738
THE PATIENT GETS
REAL‐WORLD IMAGES IN REAL TIME.

167
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,156
Asuna: THAT'S GREAT.

168
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,992
SOUNDS MORE LIKE A MIRACLE
THAN A MACHINE TO ME.

169
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,122
Dr. Kurahashi: YES.
IN A WAY, IT IS A MIRACLE.

170
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:47,545
EVEN SO, CURING ILLNESS
IS SOMETHING IT CAN'T DO.

171
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,757
THE MEDICUBOID
IS MAKING AN IMPACT, THOUGH,

172
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,426
WE HOPE, IN TERMINAL CARE.

173
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,637
Asuna: TERMINAL CARE?

174
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,930
Dr. Kurahashi: YES.

175
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,349
IT'S HELPING
PATIENTS WHO ARE DYING.

176
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,768
Asuna: (GASPS) SHE'S DYING?

177
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,562
Dr. Kurahashi: YUUKI TOLD ME

178
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,606
THAT IF YOU
REALLY WANTED TO HEAR

179
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,401
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER,
I COULD GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU,

180
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,655
BUT I HAVE TO WARN YOU,
IT'S NOT A PLEASANT STORY.

181
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,989
YOU'RE GOING TO WISH

182
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,991
THIS CONVERSATION ENDED
RIGHT HERE.

183
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,372
Asuna: (GASPS)

184
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,165
NO...

185
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,835
I WANT TO HEAR IT,
THE WHOLE THING,

186
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,546
AND I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
UNTIL YOU TELL ME.

187
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,805
Dr. Kurahashi:
YUUKI WAS BORN IN MAY OF 2011,

188
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,431
BUT THERE WERE COMPLICATIONS,

189
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,601
AND THE DOCTORS HAD TO GIVE
HER MOTHER A C‐SECTION.

190
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,603
HER MOTHER WAS GIVEN
A TRANSFUSION

191
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,605
DURING THE PROCEDURE,

192
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,108
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
THE BLOOD THEY USED

193
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,569
‐ WAS CONTAMINATED WITH A VIRUS.
‐ Asuna: (GASPS)

194
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,445
Dr. Kurahashi: THEY DIDN'T
FIND OUT ABOUT IT

195
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,698
UNTIL SEPTEMBER, WHEN HER MOTHER

196
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,617
WAS HAVING TESTS RUN
FOR AN INFECTION SHE GOT.

197
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,327
BUT BY THAT TIME,

198
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,246
THE WHOLE FAMILY'D
BEEN INFECTED.

199
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,299
THIS WAY.

200
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,012
WE HAVE TO KEEP THE ROOM

201
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,431
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS
HERMETICALLY SEALED,

202
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,850
SO THIS IS
AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET.

203
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,226
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

204
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,645
Asuna: (GASPS)

205
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,780
YUUKI.

206
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,576
DOCTOR, WHAT KIND OF ILLNESS
DOES YUUKI HAVE?

207
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,454
Dr. Kurahashi: ACQUIRED
IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME,

208
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,538
AIDS FOR SHORT.

209
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,998
Asuna: (GASPS)

210
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,335
Dr. Kurahashi: IT'S CAUSED
BY THE H. I. V. VIRUS.

211
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,003
IT'S SCARY, BUT THERE'S HOPE,

212
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,672
BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE
WHO HAS IT DEVELOPS AIDS.

213
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,676
IF YOU CAN TREAT H. I. V. EARLY,
YOU CAN HAVE A LONG LIFE.

214
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,136
(LENS WHIRS)

215
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,638
IN HER FAMILY'S CASE,

216
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,640
THE VIRUS
WAS DIFFICULT TO TREAT.

217
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,642
IT'S A DRUG‐RESISTANT STRAIN.

218
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,310
WHEN HER MOTHER FOUND OUT,

219
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,938
SHE GOT SO UPSET
OVER HER CHILDREN'S FATE,

220
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,272
SHE ACTUALLY CONSIDERED

221
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,733
KILLING THE WHOLE FAMILY
ALONG WITH HERSELF.

222
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,111
BUT THEN SHE CHANGED HER MIND

223
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,447
AND DECIDED
TO FIGHT THE DISEASE INSTEAD.

224
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,532
Asuna: SHE FOUGHT IT

225
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,493
FOR HER KIDS.

226
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,496
Dr. Kurahashi: YES.
SOON AFTER THEY WERE DIAGNOSED,

227
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,374
YUUKI WAS PUT ON A MULTIDRUG
COURSE OF THERAPY,

228
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,251
BUT IT'S HARD FOR A CHILD

229
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,586
TO HAVE TO TAKE
SO MANY DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS

230
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,921
AND KEEP TAKING THEM.

231
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,298
THE SIDE‐EFFECTS ARE ONE THING.

232
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,175
THE OTHER, BEING SHUNNED

233
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,511
BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND
HER CONDITION.

234
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,513
STILL, YUUKI WAS A TROUPER.

235
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,515
SHE BELIEVED HER
AND HER FAMILY

236
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,017
WOULD GET BETTER EVENTUALLY.

237
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,437
HOWEVER, WHEN SHE
WAS IN THE FOURTH GRADE,

238
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,481
HER IMMUNE SYSTEM
SUDDENLY COLLAPSED,

239
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,526
AND THEN SHE WAS BROUGHT
TO THIS HOSPITAL,

240
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,195
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE
WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AIDS.

241
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,655
Asuna: (SHUDDERS)

242
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,156
Dr. Kurahashi: BUT LIKE I SAID,

243
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,283
SHE'S A TROUPER.

244
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,784
SHE NEVER ONCE LOST
HER OPTIMISM.

245
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,204
Asuna: DOCTOR...

246
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,455
Dr. Kurahashi: HMM?

247
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,499
Asuna: WHY IS SHE USING
THE MEDICUBOID?

248
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,793
Dr. Kurahashi: I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY IT ALL STARTED

249
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,838
BACK WHEN EVERYONE WAS PANICKING
OVER THAT NERVEGEAR INCIDENT.

250
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,172
THEY HAD JUST COMPLETED

251
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,550
THE FIRST PROTOTYPE
OF THE MEDICUBOID.

252
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,094
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES
IT PUT OUT

253
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,388
WERE MANY TIMES STRONGER
THAN THE NERVEGEAR'S.

254
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,974
THAT WAS A PROBLEM,
SINCE NO ONE KNEW

255
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,018
WHAT THE LONG‐TERM EFFECTS
OF EXPOSURE WERE.

256
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,603
BECAUSE OF THAT,
THEY COULDN'T FIND A PATIENT

257
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,732
WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK,
SO ITS TRIAL RUN WAS STALLED.

258
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,817
WHEN I FOUND OUT,

259
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,569
I THOUGHT
ABOUT YUUKI'S SITUATION,

260
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,237
AND I CONTACTED HER PARENTS.

261
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,239
IF SHE WERE THE TEST SUBJECT,

262
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,616
SHE'D BE MOVED
TO THE MEDICUBOID STERILE ROOM.

263
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,369
SHE'D RUN LESS OF A RISK
OF GETTING AN INFECTION.

264
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,372
I TOLD THEM IT WAS
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

265
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,416
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

266
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,837
BUT HONESTLY, I STILL DON'T KNOW
IF I WAS RIGHT TO SUGGEST IT.

267
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,174
GOD KNOWS WHAT IT WAS LIKE
FOR YUUKI AND HER PARENTS,

268
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,259
THINKING ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT.

269
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,054
BUT I THINK
THE LURE OF THE UNKNOWN,

270
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,515
THE VIRTUAL WORLD WAS
THE DECIDING FACTOR FOR YUUKI,

271
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,186
SO THAT BRAVE LITTLE GIRL
AGREED TO BE A TEST SUBJECT,

272
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,812
AND THEY MOVED HER IN.

273
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,649
SHE'S LIVED INSIDE
THE MEDICUBOID EVER SINCE.

274
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,526
Asuna: YOU MEAN
SHE'S NEVER COME OUT?

275
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,153
Dr. Kurahashi: NO, SHE HASN'T.

276
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,488
YUUKI STAYS LOGGED IN

277
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,365
AND RARELY SPENDS ANY TIME
IN THE REAL WORLD.

278
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,493
SHE'S ALWAYS IN A LOT OF PAIN,

279
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,286
BUT THANKS TO THE MEDICUBOID'S
SENSATION CANCELER,

280
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,080
SHE CAN BLOCK IT OUT.

281
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:36,459
Asuna: SO WAIT. YOU MEAN SHE'S
IN A CONTINUOUS, 24‐HOUR DIVE?

282
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,710
SINCE WHEN?

283
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,046
Dr. Kurahashi:
FOR THREE YEARS NOW.

284
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,841
Asuna: THAT'S A WHOLE YEAR
LONGER THAN US.

285
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,177
Kirito: IT FELT
LIKE THEY WERE A PRODUCT

286
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,012
OF THE FULL‐DIVE
ENVIRONMENT ITSELF.

287
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,365
Asuna: THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

288
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,785
I'M GLAD I GOT TO SEE HER AGAIN.

289
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,997
SHE'LL BE OKAY
AS LONG AS SHE'S HERE, RIGHT?

290
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,834
Dr. Kurahashi: WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR HER,

291
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,002
BUT EVEN IF THE ROOM IS STERILE,

292
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,713
THERE'S NO WAY TO ELIMINATE
THE VIRUS THAT'S INSIDE HER.

293
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,257
Asuna: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

294
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,676
Dr. Kurahashi: YUUKI DOESN'T
HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT.

295
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,177
Asuna: (GASPS)

296
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,346
Dr. Kurahashi: AND THAT'S
MOST LIKELY THE REASON

297
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:34,308
WHY SHE TRIED CUTTING TIES
WITH YOU THE WAY SHE DID.

298
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,643
Asuna: THAT'S WHY SHE...

299
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,687
YUUKI!

300
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,149
Yuuki: ASUNA, I‐‐I...

301
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,651
(LAUGHS) WE DID IT!

302
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,278
LEAVE IT TO ME, SIS!

303
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,362
Asuna: (GASPS)

304
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,240
UM, DOCTOR, I WAS WONDERING,

305
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,242
DOES YUUKI HAVE AN OLDER SISTER?

306
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,661
Dr. Kurahashi:
UH, YES, ACTUALLY,

307
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,955
A TWIN SISTER, TO BE PRECISE.

308
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,332
HER NAME'S AIKO,

309
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,501
AND SHE WAS BORN
A FEW MINUTES EARLIER.

310
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,044
YUUKI WAS THE CHEERFUL ONE.

311
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,923
IN FACT, AIKO WOULD JUST SIT
AND WATCH HER AND SMILE.

312
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,634
COME TO THINK OF IT,

313
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,596
IF AIKO WERE HERE, I'D IMAGINE
SHE'D BE A LOT LIKE YOU.

314
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,764
Asuna: WHERE IS SHE?

315
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,642
Dr. Kurahashi: YUUKI'S PARENTS
PASSED AWAY TWO YEARS AGO,

316
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,062
AND LAST YEAR, AIKO.

317
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,319
Asuna: (CRYING) YUUKI.

318
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,614
YUUKI.

319
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,120
Yuuki: (SIGHS)

320
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,080
DON'T CRY, ASUNA.

321
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,790
Asuna: HUH?

322
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,753
YUUKI.

323
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,713
YUUKI! YOU CAN HEAR ME?!

324
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,424
Yuuki: YEAH, I CAN HEAR YOU.

325
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,092
I CAN SEE YOU, TOO.

326
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,138
WOW, YOU LOOK EXACTLY
LIKE YOU DO IN THE GAME.

327
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,140
THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME.

328
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,892
Asuna: YUUKI.

329
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,019
I JUST‐‐I DON'T...

330
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,104
Yuuki: HEY, DOC,
WOULD IT BE OKAY

331
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,981
IF ASUNA USED
THE ROOM NEXT‐DOOR?

332
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:04,982
Asuna: (GASPS)

333
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,400
Dr. Kurahashi: SURE. WHY NOT?

334
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,403
I KEEP AN AMUSPHERE IN THERE
SO I CAN VISIT HER.

335
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,780
GO AHEAD. IT'S ALL YOURS.

336
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,740
Asuna: THANKS.

337
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,784
Yuuki: THE "A. L. O." APP'S
ON THE START‐UP MENU.

338
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,994
AFTER YOU LOG IN,

339
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,997
COME TO THE PLACE
WHERE WE FIRST MET, OKAY?

340
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,752
(CHORUS SINGING)

341
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,552
Asuna: I WANT TO SEE YOU.

342
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,012
I WANT TO SEE YOU ONE MORE TIME!

343
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,766
I WANT TO SEE YOU,
AND THIS TIME,

344
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,185
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU FOR REAL.

345
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,659
YUUKI!

346
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,373
YUUKI!

347
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,465
(GASPS)

348
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,180
YUUKI.

349
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,307
(LAUGHS)

350
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,808
Yuuki: I KNEW IT.

351
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,645
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT,
BUT I HAD A FEELING

352
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,148
YOU'D FIND ME
IN THE REAL WORLD SOMEHOW.

353
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,151
AND I WAS SO CAREFUL
NOT TO SAY NOTHIN',

354
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,819
THOUGHT I HAD YOU FOOLED.

355
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,362
IT DIDN'T WORK.

356
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,697
YOU FOUND ME ANYWAY.

357
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,699
I MUST BE TURNING PSYCHIC,

358
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,076
'CAUSE MY PREDICTIONS
NEVER COME TRUE.

359
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,621
BUT I'M HAPPY, REALLY.

360
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,004
Asuna: (GASPS)

361
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,256
(SHUDDERS)

362
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:02,425
Yuuki: MY SIS USED
TO HUG ME LIKE THIS.

363
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:05,845
YOU SMELL LIKE HER,
LIKE THE SUN.

364
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:09,557
Asuna: DID AIKO PLAY
V. R. M. M. O. s WITH YOU, TOO?

365
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,518
Yuuki: YUP. IN FACT,

366
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,854
SHE WAS THE FIRST LEADER
THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS EVER HAD.

367
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:19,234
AND IF YOU THOUGHT I WAS STRONG,
MAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER.

368
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:22,529
WE MET SIUNE AND THE OTHER GUYS

369
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,198
IN THIS VIRTUAL HOSPICE
CALLED THE SERENE GARDEN.

370
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,659
BACK THEN,
THERE WERE NINE OF US,

371
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:30,286
BUT MY SIS
AND CLOVIS AND MERIDA,

372
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:32,956
WELL, THEY'RE ALL GONE.

373
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,082
Asuna: (GASPS)

374
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,711
Yuuki: ANYWAY,
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

375
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:40,672
WHY WE'RE DISBANDING, IT'S CAUSE
WE PROMISED EACH OTHER

376
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,299
IF WE LOST SOMEONE,
WE'D END IT.

377
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,009
I'M SORRY, ASUNA.

378
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,011
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

379
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,348
THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS WON'T BE
AROUND ANYMORE BY THIS SPRING,

380
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,852
BUT IT'S NOT 'CAUSE WE'LL ALL BE
TOO BUSY TO PLAY ANYMORE.

381
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,603
IT'S 'CAUSE A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

382
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:58,273
TWO OF US GOT THE NEWS
FROM OUR DOCTORS.

383
00:19:58,314 --> 00:19:59,774
THEY GAVE US THREE MONTHS.

384
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:00,942
Asuna: (GASPS)

385
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:04,154
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

386
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:07,657
Yuuki: YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY
WE WERE ALL SO FIRED UP

387
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:10,785
ON HAVING ONE LAST BIG ADVENTURE
TOGETHER IN THIS WORLD.

388
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:14,122
WE WANTED TO LEAVE SOME KIND
OF PROOF WE WERE HERE

389
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:16,875
ON THAT BIG OLD MONUMENT
WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE IT,

390
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,043
ONE LAST RUN THAT WAS SO COOL,

391
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,464
WE COULD BRAG ABOUT IT
TO MY SIS AND THE OTHERS.

392
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:26,176
BUT NOTHING
WAS GOING RIGHT FOR US,

393
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:28,636
SO WE DECIDED
THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE

394
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,055
WAS TO GET SOMEONE
TOUGH ENOUGH TO HELP.

395
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,057
BUT WE JUST CAUSED YOU TROUBLE,

396
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,185
AND WE HURT YOUR FEELINGS, TOO.

397
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,770
I'M SORRY.

398
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:38,104
WE ALL ARE.

399
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:39,814
FORGET ABOUT US.

400
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:41,900
IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST, ANYWAY.

401
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:44,819
Asuna: I CAN'T DO THAT.

402
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:48,448
I'M HAPPY I GOT TO MEET YOU,

403
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,991
ALL OF YOU,

404
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:53,411
AND I'M GLAD I GOT TO BE
A PART OF YOUR LAST QUEST.

405
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,621
EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING,

406
00:20:54,662 --> 00:20:57,290
I STILL WISH
I COULD JOIN THE KNIGHTS.

407
00:20:57,332 --> 00:21:00,502
Yuuki: YEAH, I WISH‐‐
I WISH YOU COULD, TOO,

408
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,172
BUT I'M HAPPY I CAME HERE
AND GOT TO MEET YOU.

409
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:06,716
YOU SAYING THAT
MAKES IT WORTH IT,

410
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,051
MORE THAN WORTH IT.

411
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,094
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

412
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,680
I'M GOOD.

413
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:16,100
Asuna: BUT ISN'T THERE
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO DO?

414
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,769
I MEAN, I'M SURE THERE'S

415
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:21,022
LOTS OF PLACES IN ALFHEIM
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN YET

416
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:22,607
AND OTHER VIRTUAL WORLDS.

417
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,944
THERE'S STILL LOTS OF THINGS
TO DO AND PLACES TO SEE.

418
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,112
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

419
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:30,949
Yuuki: FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS,

420
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,369
WE GOT TO GO ON TONS
OF ADVENTURES IN OTHER WORLDS.

421
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:37,288
BUT I WANT MY VERY LAST MEMORY

422
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,333
TO BE THE ONE I GOT TO GO ON
WITH YOU, ASUNA.

423
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,710
Asuna: YEAH, BUT CAN'T YOU
THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE

424
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:44,587
YOU WANT TO SEE OR MAYBE DO?

425
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:51,177
Yuuki: I DON'T KNOW.

426
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:53,513
I GUESS MAYBE
GO TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

427
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,056
Asuna: UH, FOR REAL?

428
00:21:55,098 --> 00:21:58,309
Yuuki: NAH, FORGET IT.
JUST KIDDING.

429
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,145
I'M HAPPY YOU WANT TO HELP,
BUT DON'T SWEAT IT.

430
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,607
IT'S COOL.
I HAD AN AWESOME LIFE, REALLY.

431
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:11,781
Asuna: MAYBE YOU CAN.

432
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:13,408
Yuuki: WAIT. WHAT?

433
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:16,661
Asuna: MAYBE YOU CAN GO,
YOU KNOW, TO SCHOOL!
