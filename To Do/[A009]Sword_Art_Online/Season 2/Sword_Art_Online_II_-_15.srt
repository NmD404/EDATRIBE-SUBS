00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,346
Host: ONLY THREE DAYS LEFT
TILL THE NEW YEAR,

2
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:15,057
AND I HOPE YOU'RE ALL
ENJOYING YOUR HOLIDAY.

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,976
Leafa: HEY,
WERE YOU UP LATE AGAIN?

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,228
Kirito: YEAH,

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,647
FOR A MECHATRONICS PROJECT
FOR SCHOOL.

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,107
Leafa: MECHA‐WHAT? SOUNDS FUN.

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,984
Host: ...FROM THE TRAFFIC
INFORMATION CENTER.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,236
‐ Leafa: KAZUTO.
‐ Kirito: HMM?

9
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,528
Leafa: YOU SEE THIS YET?

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,030
‐ (CUP CLATTERS)
‐ Kirito: WHAT THE?!

11
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:33,408
THE HOLY SWORD EXCALIBUR
HAS BEEN FOUND IN "A. L. O."?!

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,202
AW, MAN, THAT SUCKS.

13
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,205
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SOMEONE ELSE BEAT US TO IT.

14
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,581
Leafa: READ THE ARTICLE, DOOFUS.

15
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,375
IT SAYS IT'S BEEN FOUND, IS ALL.

16
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,293
NO ONE'S ACTUALLY GOT IT YET.

17
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,254
Kirito: OH.

18
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,255
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

19
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,881
DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT.

20
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,675
Leafa: (CHUCKLES)

21
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,387
Kirito: A COUPLE MONTHS AGO
ON THE ARUN PLAINS,

22
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,556
LEAFA, YUI, AND ME GOT SWALLOWED
BY A BIG‐ASS MONSTER WORM.

23
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:00,310
IT DROPPED US IN AN UNDERGROUND
REALM CALLED JOTUNHEIM.

24
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,895
WE LOOKED AROUND FOR A BIT

25
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,606
AND CAME ACROSS THIS FOUR‐ARMED
HUMANOID MONSTER.

26
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,568
IT WAS FIGHTING ANOTHER MONSTER
THAT LOOKED LIKE A CROSS

27
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,486
BETWEEN AN ELEPHANT
AND A JELLYFISH.

28
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,239
GO FIGURE. LEAFA FELT SORRY
FOR THE JELLY‐PHANT THING

29
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,199
AND TOLD ME TO GO SAVE IT.

30
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,410
I LURED FOUR ARMS
ONTO THIS FROZEN LAKE,

31
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,412
AND IT FELL THROUGH THE ICE.

32
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,330
THEN THE JELLY‐PHANT
TOOK CARE OF IT.

33
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,709
LEAFA DECIDED TO CALL IT TONKY,

34
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,335
AND SUDDENLY IT TRANSFORMED

35
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,838
INTO AN EVEN‐WEIRDER‐LOOKING
THING WITH EIGHT WINGS.

36
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,341
WE HOPPED ON ITS BACK,
AND IT TOOK US TO A PASSAGEWAY

37
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,218
LEADING TO THE SURFACE WORLD.

38
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:40,058
ON THE WAY UP WAS WHEN WE
SAW IT, AN UPSIDE‐DOWN PYRAMID

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,728
HANGING FROM THE ROOTS
OF THE WORLD TREE

40
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,939
AND A LONG, GOLDEN SWORD
SHIMMERING INSIDE.

41
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,239
EXCALIBUR.

42
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,659
I WAS PLANNING ON GOING BACK
FOR IT SOMEDAY, BUT NOW...

43
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,328
Leafa: IT'D BE A NICE BREAK

44
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,788
FROM ALL THAT FLOOR‐CLEARING
YOU'RE DOING IN NEW AINCRAD.

45
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,790
Kirito: THIS ARTICLE
DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING

46
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,208
ABOUT HOW THEY FOUND IT.

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,877
PLAYERS CAN'T FLY
IN JOTUNHEIM, REMEMBER?

48
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,546
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SPOT EXCALIBUR.

49
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,423
THAT THING'S TOO HIGH UP TO SEE.

50
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,759
Leafa: UNLESS THEY RESCUED
ONE OF TONKY'S FRIENDS,

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,844
HITCHED A RIDE,
AND TRIGGERED THE QUEST FLAG.

52
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,055
IF WE COULD DO IT,
SO COULD SOMEONE ELSE.

53
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,223
Kirito: I GUESS
THAT MAKES SENSE,

54
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,892
ALTHOUGH WHO'D TRUST A CREEPY‐‐

55

‐ Leafa: (GROWLS)
‐ Kirito: (GRUNTS)

56
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,855
UH, I MEAN WHO'D TRUST
SUCH A UNIQUE MONSTER

57
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,066
‐ UNLESS THEY HAD WEIRD TA‐‐
‐ Leafa: (GROWLS)

58
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,109
Kirito: I MEAN
A WEIRDLY BIG HEART.

59
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,110
(BUBBLES BUBBLING)

60
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,654
SOMEONE JUST LIKE YOU, SIS.

61
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,696
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

62
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,781
Leafa: HE IS NOT CREEPY.

63
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,115
HE'S ADORABLE.

64
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,660
ANYWAY, THE WHOLE POINT
OF SHOWING YOU THAT

65
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,078
WAS TO GET YOU GOING.

66
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,413
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE SOMEONE

67
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,666
GRINDS THROUGH THAT DUNGEON
AND GETS THE SWORD.

68
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,250
Kirito: YOU'RE RIGHT.
CLOCK'S TICKING.

69
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,003
Leafa: SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

70
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,382
Kirito: (CLEARS THROAT)

71
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,426
SUGU, GETTING RARE ITEMS
ISN'T THE POINT OF IT.

72
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,388
IF THAT'S ALL YOU PLAY FOR,
YOU'RE MISSING OUT.

73
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,223
Leafa: YEAH,
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

74
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,809
THERE'S FUNNER THINGS TO DO
THAN BOOSTING STATS.

75
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,976
Kirito: I WASN'T FINISHED.

76
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,145
I THINK TONKY
WANTED US TO FIND IT,

77
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,106
AND THAT'S WHY
HE SHOWED US WHERE IT WAS.

78
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,858
FOR SOME REASON, HE NEEDS US
TO CLEAR THAT DUNGEON,

79
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,945
SO IT'S UP TO US
TO MAKE HIS WISH COME TRUE.

80
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,571
TONKY'S OUR FRIEND,
AND THERE'S NO WAY

81
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,198
I'M TURNING MY BACK ON A FRIEND.

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,950
Leafa: MMM!

83
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,577
A MINUTE AGO,
YOU CALLED YOUR FRIEND CREEPY.

84
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,496
Kirito: MM.

85
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,872
I MEANT CREEPY COOL.

86
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,749
ANYWAY, YOU IN?

87
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,502
Leafa: SURE. I DON'T HAVE
PRACTICE 'CAUSE OF THE HOLIDAYS.

88
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,586
Kirito: AWESOME.

89
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,171
OKAY, WE'LL NEED SEVEN OTHERS.

90
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,006
WE DON'T WANT TO OVERLOAD TONKY.

91
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,676
FOR STARTERS, WE GOT
YOU, ME, AND ASUNA.

92
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,345
THEN THERE'S KLEIN,
LIZ, AND SILICA.

93
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,722
WE NEED ONE MORE PERSON.

94
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,308
AGIL'S GOTTA WORK TONIGHT.

IN SYLPH TERRITORY.

97
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,772
Leafa: OH, I KNOW.

98
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,691
LET'S ASK SINON TO COME ALONG.

99
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,776
Kirito: GREAT IDEA, SIS.

100
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,069
Leafa: WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?

101
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,737
I'LL MESSAGE 'EM RIGHT NOW,

102
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,407
EXCEPT FOR ASUNA.
I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU.

103
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,700
Kirito: OKAY.

104
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,912
Asuna: (SIGHS)

105
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,457
I WISH I COULD SEE KIRITO AGAIN

106
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,917
BEFORE I GO VISIT
MY GRANDPARENTS.

107
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,378
(RINGTONE CHIMING)

108
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,841
H‐HI, KIRITO.

109
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,301
Kirito: MORNING, ASUNA.

110
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,802
SORRY TO CALL SO EARLY.

111
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,430
WE WERE PLANNING
ON GOING ON A QUEST

112
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,849
IN "A. L. O." THIS AFTERNOON.
YOU WANT TO GO?

113
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,810
Asuna: YEAH, I'LL TOTALLY GO.
I'M FREE ALL DAY TODAY.

114
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,062
Kirito: COOL. I'LL TEXT YOU
THE TIME AND PLACE,

115
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,773
SO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR IT.

116
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,357
Asuna: YOU KNOW I WILL.

117
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,651
SEE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE, THEN.

118
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,779
YES.

119
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,963
Klein: (SIGHS)

120
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,381
‐ (LAUGHS)
‐ Silica: HEY, KLEIN,

121
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,884
DO YOU GET TO TAKE VACATION
FOR NEW YEAR'S?

122
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,468
Klein: BEEN ON IT
SINCE YESTERDAY.

123
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,804
EVEN IF I WANTED TO WORK‐‐
AND I DON'T‐‐

124
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,472
THERE'S NO SHIPMENTS
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

125
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,308
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY CHEAP‐ASS BOSS SAID?

126
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,602
"BE THANKFUL YOU GOT
A JOB WHERE YOU GET

127
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,061
A WHOLE WEEK OFF
FOR NEW YEAR'S,"

128
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,522
BRAGGING ABOUT IT LIKE HE
WAS DOING US A FAVOR.

129
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,274
AND SPEAKING OF FAVORS,

130
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,693
IF WE DO MANAGE
TO SNAG EXCALIBUR TODAY,

131
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,528
HOW ABOUT DOING ME A SOLID

132
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,364
AND HELPING ME GET MY HANDS
ON THE SOUL BLADE KAGUZUCHI?

133
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,741
Kirito: SERIOUSLY?

134
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,659
THAT DUNGEON'S LIKE
A FRIGGING OVEN, MAN.

135
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,953
Klein: YEAH, WELL,
I'M GOING TO JOTUNHEIM FOR YOU,

136
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,039
WHERE IT'S COLDER
THAN THE ASS‐END OF AN ICE POP.

137
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,958
Sinon: YOU KNOW, I WANT
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS, TOO,

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,251
THE SHEKHINAH BOW.

139
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,920
Kirito: UH, YOUR AVATAR'S
TWO WEEKS OLD,

140
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,715
AND ALREADY YOU'RE GUNNING
FOR A LEGENDARY WEAPON?

141
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,259
Sinon: YEAH, WELL, THAT BOW
LIZ MADE ME IS GREAT AND ALL,

142
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,178
BUT I NEED SOMETHING
WITH A LITTLE MORE RANGE.

Lisbeth: OH, YEAH?

144
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,932
THEN WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU
USING A BOW IN "A. L. O." FOR?

145
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,018
THEIR RANGE FALLS
BETWEEN SPEARS AND MAGIC.

146
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,229
YOU'RE LIKE THE ONLY PLAYER
WHO WANTS TO USE THESE THINGS

147

153
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,824
Asuna: THANKS FOR WAITING.

154
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,077

YOU WERE NEVER COMING BACK.

155
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,329
Klein: WHAT'S UP?
YOU GET LOST OR SOMETHING?

156
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,747
Yui: NOT AT ALL.

157
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,208
WE WERE GATHERING INFORMATION
WHILE WE SHOPPED.

158
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,002
WE TALKED TO A WHOLE BUNCH
OF PEOPLE, DADDY,

159
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,421
AND SO FAR,
NOT ONE PLAYER OR PARTY

160
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,756
HAS REACHED THAT DUNGEON YET.

161
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,549
Kirito: REALLY?

162
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,344
WELL, THEN HOW THE HECK DO THEY
KNOW WHERE EXCALIBUR'S AT?

163
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,762
Yui: THAT'S THE THING, DADDY.

164
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,889
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHERE IT IS.

165
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,641
APPARENTLY THEY FOUND
A DIFFERENT QUEST

166
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,393
THAN THE ONE TONKY SHOWED US.

167
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,604
THEY MET AN NPC WHO TOLD THEM IF
THEY FINISHED THIS OTHER QUEST,

168
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,440
THEY'D GET EXCALIBUR
AS THE REWARD.

169
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,442
Asuna: AND FROM WHAT WE HEARD,

170
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,112
THE QUEST THEY'RE GOING ON
ISN'T VERY PLEASANT.

171
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,699
INSTEAD OF A DELIVERY QUEST
OR AN ESCORT QUEST,

172
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,494
IT'S A KILL QUEST,
JUST SLAUGHTERING MONSTERS.

173
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,955
EVERYONE IN JOTUNHEIM
IS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

174
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,790
KILLING AS MANY AS THEY CAN.

175
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,668
Kirito: YEAH, THAT DOESN'T EVEN
SOUND CLOSE TO BEING PLEASANT.

176
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,337
Klein: THIS WHOLE THING
SOUNDS SKETCHY TO ME, GUYS.

177
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,047
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.

178
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,341
THERE'S A DUNGEON IN THE SKY
WITH EXCALIBUR LOCKED UP

179
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,385
AT THE BOTTOM OF IT.
TO GET TO IT,

180
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,637
YOU GOTTA FIGHT YOUR WAY
THROUGH A BUNCH OF MONSTERS.

181
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,473
BUT NOW WE GOT AN NPC
OFFERING IT UP

182
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,392
AS A KILL‐QUEST REWARD?
THAT'S BIZARRE.

183
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,436
Silica: NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

184
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,062
‐ THAT IS WEIRD.
‐ Pina: (COOS)

185
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,773
Silica: THE NPC's NOT
SHOWING ANYONE TO THE DUNGEON,

186
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,025
BUT THAT'S WHERE THE SWORD IS.

187
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,402
All: ( SIGH )

188
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,362
Sinon: WELL, I'M SURE
WE'LL FIND OUT WHY

189
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,405
ONCE WE GET THERE.

190
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,116
Lisbeth: ALL RIGHTY.

191
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,036
YOUR WEAPONS ARE ALL RESTORED
AND READY FOR ACTION.

192
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,762
Klein: EVEN THOUGH
OUR PARTY'S FULL OF HOTNESS,

193
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,221
WE'RE STILL A BUNCH
OF GEAR‐TOTING MEATHEADS.

194
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,723
Lisbeth: IF YOU
WANNA SWITCH IT UP,

195
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,141
YOU COULD ALWAYS
BOOST YOUR MAGIC.

196
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,809
Klein: HA! KEEP DREAMING.

197
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,396
A REAL SAMURAI, HE WOULDN'T
BE CAUGHT DEAD USING MAGIC.

198
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,814
CODE OF HONOR.

199
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,483
Lisbeth: CODE OF HONOR, HUH?

200
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,152
KNOW WHAT SAMURAI'S ARE
CLASSIFIED AS IN RPGs?

201
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,488
THEY'RE BOTH WARRIORS
AND BLACK‐MAGIC USERS.

202
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,823
Klein: PLEASE.
I'D RATHER BUST MY SWORD

203
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,242
AND QUIT BEING A SAMURAI
THAN USE MAGIC, DOLL.

204
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,995
Silica: I DON'T KNOW, KLEIN.
IF I REMEMBER RIGHT,

205
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,873
DIDN'T YOU USE A FLAME‐SWORD
SKILL THE OTHER DAY?

206
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,459
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ACTIVATE IT,
YOU ARE USING PART MAGIC.

207
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,211
Klein: NO WAY. REALLY?

208
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,422
Yui: YES, KLEIN.
WHAT SILICA SAID IS TRUE.

209
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,007
REMEMBER THE MAY UPDATE?

210
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,968
IT BROUGHT A WHOLE BUNCH
OF NEW SWORD SKILLS TO "A. L. O."

211
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,846
SOME ARE PHYSICAL,
AND OTHERS ARE ADVANCED,

212
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,975
LIKE EARTH, WATER, FIRE,
WIND, DARK, AND DIVINE,

213
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,977
ALL OF WHICH
ARE MAGICAL ATTRIBUTES.

214
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,064
Klein: FIRE'S MAGICAL, TOO, HUH?

215
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,190
Lisbeth: OKAY, EX‐SAMURAI,

216
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,025
YOU NEED HELP
BUSTING THAT SWORD?

217

Klein: (GASPS)

218
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,612

CHANT WHEN USING SWORD SKILLS,

220
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,534
I GUESS IT'S NOT THE SAME.

221
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,994

SLIDE THIS TIME. HEH.

SERIOUSLY, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME.

HOW MANY STEPS DOES

ON THE DUNGEON FLOOR

233

EVEN HAVE AS MANY AS THIS.

234
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,735
Kirito: OH, COME ON.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

235
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,821
IF WE TOOK THE NORMAL ROUTE
TO JOTUNHEIM,

236
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,406
IT'D TAKE AT LEAST TWO HOURS.

237
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,907
THIS WAY,
IT'S JUST FIVE MINUTES.

238
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,034
INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE STEPS,

239
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,703
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME

240

Klein: DAMN, SHE'S TALL.

336
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,829
All: (GASP)

337
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,455
Urd: GREETINGS.

338
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,083
I AM URD, QUEEN OF THE LAKE.

339
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,961
YOU HAVE BONDED WITH MY KINSMAN,

340
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,421
AND I AM GRATEFUL.

341
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,549
MY TWO YOUNGER SISTERS AND I
HAVE SPOKEN AT LENGTH,

342
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,718
AND WE HAVE A REQUEST FOR YOU.

343
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,636
IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND,

344
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,182
WE ASK THAT YOU SAVE OUR LANDS
FROM THE FROST GIANTS.

345
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,268
Yui: DADDY, SHE'S AN NPC.

346
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,770
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE
ABOUT HER, THOUGH.

347
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,148
HER SPEECH PATTERN
DOESN'T FOLLOW

348
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,818
THE SAME SET RESPONSE ROUTINES
THAT A NORMAL NPC's WOULD.

349
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,486
HER CORE PROGRAMMING
IS CONNECTED

350
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,531
TO THE LANGUAGE ENGINE MODULE
OF THE GAME.

351
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,116
Kirito: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

352
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,701
IS SHE SOME KIND OF A. I.?

353
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,203
Yui: YES, DADDY, SHE IS.

354
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,621
Urd: IN THE PAST,

355
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,290
JOTUNHEIM WAS SIMILAR
TO YOUR ALFHEIM,

356
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,335
COVERED IN LUSH GREENERY
AND BEAUTIFUL LAKES.

357
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,130
IT BASKED IN THE BLESSINGS
OF YGGDRASIL, THE WORLD TREE.

358
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,133
WE, THE HILL GIANTS,

359
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,052
LIVED IN PEACE AND HARMONY

360
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,638
WITH OUR KINFOLK, THE CREATURES.

361
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,683
FAR BELOW
THE SPLENDOR OF JOTUNHEIM

362
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,062
IS A REALM OF ICE AND SNOW
KNOWN AS NIFLHEIM.

363
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,564
THRYMR,
KING OF THE FROST GIANTS,

364
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,066
RULES THAT LAND.

365
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,361
HE SHATTERED OUR PEACE
BY CASTING EXCALIBUR,

366
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,030
THE SWORD THAT SLICES
THROUGH WOOD AND IRON,

367
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,199
INTO THE WELL OF URD,

368
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,951
THE HEART OF OUR LAND.

369
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,372
IT SEVERED THE THICKEST ROOTS
OF THE WORLD TREE.

370
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,833
IN AN INSTANT,
JOTUNHEIM LOST THE BLESSINGS

371
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,835
IT RECEIVED FROM YGGDRASIL.

372
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,773
Kirito: I WAS RIGHT, EXCALIBUR.

373
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,277
Urd: UNDER THRYMR'S COMMAND,

374
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,988
THE FROST GIANTS
MARCHED ON JOTUNHEIM

375
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,073
AND OVERWHELMED OUR DEFENSES.

376
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,243
THEIR FORTRESSES AND CASTLES
SOON BLIGHTED OUR LAND,

377
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:01,414
AND SCORES OF MY PEOPLE
WERE CAPTURED AND IMPRISONED.

378
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,207
ONCE THEY SEIZED CONTROL,

379
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,835
THEY BUILT THRYMHEIM,
THEIR LARGEST CASTLE,

380
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:10,339
ATOP THE MASS OF ICE
ONCE KNOWN AS THE WELL OF URD.

381
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,092
DURING THE CHAOS,
MY SISTERS AND I

382
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,720
ESCAPED TO THE BOTTOM
OF A FROZEN LAKE.

383
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,348
HOWEVER, WE NO LONGER
HAVE THE POWER WE ONCE HAD.

384
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,769
THE FROST GIANTS ARE NOT
SATISFIED WITH THEIR SPOILS.

385
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,147
THEY WISH TO ANNIHILATE OUR KIN,

386
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,275
THE CREATURES
THAT POPULATE OUR REALM.

387
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,945
IF THEY SUCCEED, MY POWERS
WILL BE EXTINGUISHED,

388
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,324
AND THRYMHEIM WILL RISE
TO THE NEXT WORLD,

389
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,368
YOUR WORLD, ALFHEIM.

390
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,953
Klein: (GASPS) HOLD THE PHONE.

391
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,997
YOU'RE TELLING US
THAT ONCE THEY'RE DONE HERE,

392
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,624
THEY'RE GONNA GO UP
AND DESTROY ARUN?

393
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,959
Urd: YES, THAT IS
THEIR INTENTION.

394
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:51,172
KING THRYMR WILL SEAL ALFHEIM
IN ICE AND CONTINUE ON

395
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,633
UNTIL HE REACHES
THE TOP OF YGGDRASIL.

396
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,011
ONCE HE REACHES IT,

397
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,388
HE WILL TAKE
THE GOLDEN APPLE GROWING THERE.

398
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,267
THRYMR AND HIS GENERALS
HAVE GROWN FRUSTRATED

399
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,312
BY THE TIME IT IS TAKING
TO WIPE OUT MY KINFOLK,

400
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,856
SO THEY HAVE TURNED
TO YOUR PEOPLE, THE FAERIES,

401
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:13,147
FOR ASSISTANCE
IN THEIR MURDEROUS PLOT.

402
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:16,275
YOUR KIND HUNTS
OUR KINFOLK TO EXTINCTION,

403
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,992
LURED BY THE OFFER
OF EXCALIBUR AS A REWARD.

404
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,745
HOWEVER, KING THRYMR

405
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,873
CANNOT BESTOW
THAT SWORD UNTO OTHERS,

406
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,835
FOR IF EXCALIBUR
EVER LEAVES THRYMHEIM,

407
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,963
THE BLESSINGS OF YGGDRASIL
WILL RETURN TO THIS LAND,

408
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,633
AND THEIR CASTLE WILL VANISH
AS A MIST UPON A MEADOW.

409
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,969
Lisbeth: BUT‐‐BUT THEN...

410
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,180
WHAT KIND OF QUEST IS IT WHEN
THE REWARD FOR IT'S A TOTAL LIE?

411
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,016
HOW IS HE GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT?

412
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,560
Urd: MOST LIKELY,
HE WILL AWARD THE VICTOR

413
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,894
A SWORD CALLED CALIBURN,

414
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,480
WHOSE APPEARANCE
IS IDENTICAL TO EXCALIBUR.

415
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,065
Leafa: BUT THAT'S CHEATING.

416
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,192
IF HE'S A KING, DOESN'T HE
HAVE A CODE OF HONOR?

417
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,195
Urd: UNFORTUNATELY,
CHEATING AND FALSEHOODS

418
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,906
ARE THRYMR'S
MOST POWERFUL ASSETS.

419
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,910
HOWEVER, HE HAS MADE
ONE GREAT MISTAKE.

420
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,288
IN HIS EAGERNESS
TO SLAUGHTER MY KIN,

421
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,958
HE HAS SENT A NUMBER OF
HIS GIANTS DOWN FROM THRYMHEIM

422
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,752
TO MARSHAL YOUR KIND FOR BATTLE.

423
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,254
AT THIS MOMENT,
THE DEFENSES OF HIS CASTLE

424
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,089
ARE WEAKER
THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN.

425
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,966
Kirito: THERE'S OUR SHOT.

426
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,393
Urd: ONCE THE STONE
IN THE AMULET TURNS BLACK,

427
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,688
IT WILL MEAN ALL MY KINFOLK
HAVE BEEN SLAIN

428
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,149
AND MY POWERS HAVE LEFT ME.

429
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:36,736
GOOD FAERIES,
INFILTRATE THRYMHEIM,

430
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,946
REMOVE EXCALIBUR
FROM ITS PLINTH,

431
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,657
AND SAVE MY REALM.

432
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:47,497
I AM COUNTING ON YOU,
GOOD FAERIES.

433
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,418
Tonky: (BELLOWS)

434
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,715
Asuna: THIS IS TURNING INTO
A BIGGER DEAL THAN WE THOUGHT.

435
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,218
Sinon: IS THIS STILL
CONSIDERED A QUEST?

436
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,428
'CAUSE IT'S KINDA TURNED INTO

437
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,223
SOMETHING WAY MORE EPIC
THAN A PLAIN OLD QUEST.

438
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,100
YOU HEARD HER. SHE SAID

439
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,894
IF THE CREATURES IN THIS WORLD
GET KILLED OFF,

440
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,397
THE FROST GIANTS'LL TAKE OVER
THE SURFACE NEXT.

441
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,731
Kirito: YEAH, I KNOW,

442
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,567
BUT I DOUBT THE ADMINS
WOULD LET THAT HAPPEN

443
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,487
WITHOUT SOME KIND OF UPDATE
OR WARNING OR SOMETHING.

444
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,406
I MEAN, NORMALLY,

445
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,200
THEY'D LET PLAYERS KNOW
A WEEK AHEAD OF TIME.

446
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:28,121
Leafa: WHATEVER. WE'RE GONNA
FINISH THIS QUEST FOR TONKY.

447
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,122
RIGHT, KAZUTO?

448
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,206
Kirito: YOU KNOW IT.

449
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,833
WE WERE GONNA STORM THE CASTLE

450
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,501
AND GRAB EXCALIBUR ANYWAY.

451
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:36,462
IT'LL BE EASY IF
THE CASTLE'S DEFENSES ARE DOWN.

452
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,757
HELPING TONKY AND HIS FRIENDS
OUT, THAT'S A BONUS.

453
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,928
Kirito: HERE WE GO, GUYS!

454
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,805
OUR LAST BIG QUEST OF THE YEAR!

455
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,890
LET'S SPANK THIS THING
AND SCORE US A SPOT

456
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,268
ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF MMO TOMORROW!

457
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,728
All: YEAH!

458
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,023
Tonky: (BELLOWS)

459
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,943
Leafa: DON'T YOU WORRY, TONKY.

460
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,279
WE'LL GET
YOUR HOME BACK FOR YOU.

461
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,905
IT'LL BE GOOD AS NEW. PROMISE.

462
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,791
Kirito: HERE WE GO.
