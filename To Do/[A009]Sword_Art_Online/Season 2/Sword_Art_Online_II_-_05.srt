00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,436
Both: (GASP)

2
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,771
Kirito: FIVE MINUTES TO GO.

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,064
Sinon: WE HAVE TO HURRY.

4
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,732
THIS WAY.

5
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,921
Kirito: (GASPS)

6
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,923
Sinon: HEY, COME ON.

7
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,807
Kirito, thinking: I WONDER IF
ONE OF THESE GUYS IS DEATH GUN.

8
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,435
Sinon: HERE WE ARE.

9
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,146
THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE
TO SIGN UP FOR THE TOURNEY.

10
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,815
IT'S A TYPICAL, RUN‐OF‐THE‐MILL
TOUCH‐PANEL INTERFACE.

11
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,360
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT,
OR YOU WANT SOME HELP?

12
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,320
Kirito: NO, I CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

13
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,114
Sinon: COOL. I'M GONNA BE
OVER AT THE NEXT TERMINAL,

14
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,866
SO IF YOU GET STUCK, HOLLER.

15
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,576
Kirito: OKAY. THANKS A LOT.

16
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,167
HUH?

17
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,965
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ENTER
OUR REAL‐LIFE INFO?

18
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,516
HMM.

19
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,568
‐ Sinon: YOU DONE YET?
‐ Kirito: (GASPS)

20
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,364
YES, I'M ALL DONE.

21
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,741
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOUR HELP TODAY.

22
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,826
SORRY FOR ALL THE TROUBLE.

23
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,369
Sinon: NO WORRIES.

24
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,122
THAT CRAZY RIDE ON THE BUGGY
MORE THAN MADE UP FOR IT.

25
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,542
ANYWAY, WHICH BLOCK DID YOU
END UP WITH FOR THE PRELIMS?

26
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,501
Kirito: UM...

27
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:33,255
"F," I GUESS, F‐37.

28
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,714
Sinon: OH, REALLY?

29
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,800
I'M IN "F," TOO, NUMBER 12.

30
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,136
THAT'S KIND OF
A COOL COINCIDENCE, HUH?

31
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,929
WHEN DO WE MEET, THOUGH?

32
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,015
OH, GOOD. WE'RE NOT GONNA
MEET UP AGAIN TILL THE FINALS.

33
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,768
Kirito: I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU MEAN. WHY IS THAT GOOD?

34
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,061
Sinon: IF A PLAYER MAKES IT

35
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,980
TO THE FINAL BRACKET
IN THE PRELIMS,

36
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,648
IT WON'T MATTER IF THEY LOSE.

37
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,525
THEY'LL AUTOMATICALLY ADVANCE
TO THE BATTLE ROYALE.

38
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,360
THAT MEANS WE BOTH HAVE A SHOT

39
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,945
AT ADVANCING
TO THE BATTLE ROYALE

40
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,531
AS LONG AS WE MAKE IT
TO THE LAST BRACKET.

41
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,532
Kirito: OH.

42
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,534
Sinon: BUT IF WE DO MEET

43
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,744
IN THE FINAL BRACKET
OF THE PRELIMS,

44
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,705
I'LL BE PLAYING TO WIN.

45
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,166
Kirito: OH. I GET IT.

46
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,502
ALL RIGHT, IF WE BOTH MAKE IT,
NO HOLDING BACK.

47
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,011
WOW. I'M IMPRESSED.

48
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,181
THE JAPANESE TRANSLATION ON
THESE TERMINALS IS PRETTY GOOD.

49
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,100
THE OFFICIAL SITE
WAS ENGLISH ONLY.

50
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,436
Sinon: WELL, ZASKAR,
THE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED

51
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,438
AND RUNS THE GAME, IS AMERICAN.

52
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,691
THEY PROBABLY HAVE SOME JAPANESE
STAFF TO RUN JAPAN'S SERVER.

53
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,611
OH, AND GET THIS.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW,

54
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,281
BUT "GGO" OPERATES AN ILLEGAL
GRAY ZONE HERE AND IN THE U. S.

55
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,408
Kirito: 'CAUSE OF ITS
CASH‐CONVERSION SYSTEM, RIGHT?

56
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,076
Sinon: (CHUCKLES)

57
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,079
YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING
ON THE COMPANY'S HOME PAGE

58
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,040
EXCEPT
THE MOST BASIC INFORMATION,

59
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,000
AND AS FOR MANAGING
YOUR CHARACTER

60
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,668
OR ACCESSING
YOUR E‐MONEY ACCOUNT

61
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,378
TO CONVERT WHAT YOU EARN,

62
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,130
ANY AND ALL
GAME‐RELATED PROCEDURES

63
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,466
HAVE TO BE DONE IN THE GAME.

64
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,509
Kirito: IT'S AMAZING,

65
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,385
SHADY, BUT AMAZING.

66
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,012
Sinon: IT IS.

67
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,682
THE GAME'S PRACTICALLY
INDEPENDENT OF THE REAL WORLD.

68
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,603
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
THE PERSON I AM IN HERE

69
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,648
AND THE REAL ME FEEL LIKE
TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

70
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,694
SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
WHY I WENT THERE.

71
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,697
WE SHOULD START HEADING OVER
TO THE PRELIM AREA NOW.

72
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,824
YOU READY TO GO?

73
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,242
‐ Kirito: SURE.
‐ Sinon: THAT WAY.

74
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,618
IT'S IN THE BASEMENT.

75
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,878
Kirito: (GASPS)

76
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,224
Sinon: SOMETHING WRONG?

77
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,142
Kirito: HUH? NO, NOTHING.

78
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,352
Sinon: GOOD.

79
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,646
LET'S GO
TO THE WAITING ROOM FIRST.

80
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,314
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME PRIVACY

81
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,650
TO CHANGE
INTO YOUR NEW COMBAT SUIT.

82
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,693
Kirito: RIGHT.

83
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,617
(GASPS)

84
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,959
Sinon: (SIGHS)

85
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,962
I SWEAR,
WHAT A BUNCH OF DUMB‐ASSES.

86
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,214
Kirito: HUH? WHO DO YOU MEAN?

87
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,216
THOSE TOUGH‐LOOKING GUYS
OUTSIDE?

88
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,551
Sinon: YEAH, THEM.

89
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,177
IT'S A HALF‐HOUR
BEFORE THE MATCH,

90
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,388
AND THEY'RE OUT THERE
SHOWING OFF THEIR MAIN WEAPONS.

91
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,681
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE ASKING YOU

92
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,308
TO COME UP
WITH A COUNTERMEASURE.

93
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,476
Kirito: OH.
YEAH, THAT IS SILLY.

94
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,186
Sinon: PIECE OF ADVICE,

95
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,272
DON'T EQUIP YOUR PHOTON SWORD
AND FIVE SEVEN

96
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,857
TILL JUST BEFORE
YOUR MATCH STARTS.

97
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:39,983
Kirito: MM‐HMM.

98
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,697
(GASPS)

99
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,576
Sinon: HUH?

100
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,910
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

101
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,912
HURRY UP,
AND GET CHANGED ALREADY.

102
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,248
Kirito: UH, YES.
I MEAN, I CAN'T.

103
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,167
I MEAN I CAN'T CHANGE NOW!

104
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,793
I‐‐I MEAN‐‐

105
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,794
I'M SORRY!

106

Sinon: WHY?

107
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,922
Kirito: I HAVEN'T
INTRODUCED MYSELF.

108
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,091
THIS IS WHO I REALLY AM.

109
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,010
Sinon: OKAY.

110
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,554
KIRITO. HUH.

111
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,932
WELL, IT'S AN INTERESTING NAME.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

112
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:13,975
WAIT.

113
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,227
MALE?! BUT...

124
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,940
STOP FOLLOWING ME.

125
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,316
Kirito: BUT I'M NOT SURE

126

(GROANS)

135
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,775
I'LL EXPLAIN IT,
BUT JUST THE BARE MINIMUM.

136
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,110
THAT'S IT. AFTER THAT,

137
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,778
YOU AND ME ARE ENEMIES.

138
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,779
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

Sinon: YEAH, WELL,
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,204
YOU SEE THAT CLOCK UP THERE?

143
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,123
WHEN IT HITS ZERO,

144
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,168
EVERYONE HERE WILL AUTOMATICALLY
BE TRANSFERRED TO A BATTLEFIELD.

145
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,837
ALONG WITH WHOEVER THEIR
FIRST‐ROUND OPPONENT'S GONNA BE.

Sinon: THE FIELD'S A SQUARE.

EACH SIDE'S A KILOMETER.

ARE ALL RANDOMLY GENERATED.

WHOEVER WINS THE MATCH
GETS TRANSFERRED BACK HERE.

153
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,568
THE LOSER'S TRANSFERRED
TO THE FIRST‐FLOOR HALL,

AND YOU DON'T GET PENALIZED
FOR LOSING A MATCH.

155
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,992
THERE ARE SIXTY‐FOUR PEOPLE
IN BLOCK "F,"

156
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,161
SO FIVE WINS
WILL TAKE YOU TO THE FINAL,

FOR THE BATTLE ROYALE.

I TAUGHT YOU TODAY,

THERE'S ONE THING LEFT
FOR YOU TO LEARN.

GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE PRELIMS.

NOT THIS TIME.

174
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,373
THIS TIME, I'LL KILL
ALL THE STRONG PLAYERS.

175
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,833
HEH.

WE'LL BE CHATTING LIKE THIS,

177
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,677
YOU SHOULD KNOW MY NAME.
THERE IT IS,

178
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,139
THE NAME OF THE PERSON
WHO'S GONNA BEAT YOU.

179
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,099
Kirito: SINON.

180
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,686
I'M KIRITO.

181
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,812
NICE TO MEET YOU.

182
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,191
Sinon: (SCOFFS)

183
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,276
Kirito: (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

184
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,527
Spiegel: HEY.

185
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,112
ABOUT TIME YOU SHOWED UP.

186
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,697
I COULDN'T FIND YOU ANYWHERE,

187
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,532
AND I WAS WORRIED
YOU WEREN'T GONNA MAKE IT.

188
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,492
Sinon:
SORRY ABOUT THAT, SPIEGEL.

189
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,163
I TOTALLY LOST TRACK OF TIME
THANKS TO AN UNEXPECTED CHORE.

190
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,790
HEY, HANG ON.
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T COMPETING.

191
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,333
DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

192
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,836
Spiegel: WELL, EVEN THOUGH
I KNOW HOW MUCH IT BUGS YOU,

193
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,380
I THOUGHT I'D SORT OF
CHEER YOU ON FROM THE SIDELINES.

194
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,965
I ALREADY PICKED OUT A SPOT

195
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,092
IN FRONT OF THE JUMBO SCREEN
AND EVERYTHING.

196
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,053
WHAT WAS THAT UNEXPECTED CHORE
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

197
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,555
Sinon: OH, NOTHING.

198
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,850
I WAS JUST GIVING THIS PERSON
A SORT OF ORIENTATION.

199
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,769
Kirito: THAT'D BE ME.
HI. HOW'S IT GOING?

200
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,814
Spiegel: OH, HI.
IT'S, UH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

201
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,067
SO, UH, ARE YOU
A FRIEND OF SINON'S?

202
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,738
Sinon: HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
BUT SHE'S A DUDE.

203
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,990
Kirito: YEAH.
MY NAME'S KIRITO.

204
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,617
I'M A DUDE.

205
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,202
Spiegel: A‐‐A GUY?

206
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,205
THEN DOES THAT MEAN HE'S A‐‐
THAT YOU'RE‐‐

207
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,581
Kirito: NOT EVEN.

208
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,750
HEY, SINON, THANKS FOR
SHOWING ME A GOOD TIME.

209
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,168
IT WAS A GREAT FIRST DATE.

210
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,502
Sinon: WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU SAYING?

211
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,754
IT WASN'T A GOOD TIME,

212
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,756
AND IT WAS NOT A DATE.
IT WAS A MISTAKE,

213
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,549
SO FORGET MY NAME,
AND FORGET WE EVER MET.

214
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,801
Kirito: OH, COME ON.
DON'T BE SO HEARTLESS.

215
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,221
Sinon: HEARTLESS, MY ASS.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

216
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,223
Kirito: BUT WE SPENT
THE WHOLE DAY TOGETHER

217
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,474
PICKING OUT ALL MY GEAR.

218
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,935
Sinon: YEAH,
BUT ONLY 'CAUSE YOU LI‐‐

219
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,854
Announcer: THANK YOU
FOR YOUR PATIENCE, PLAYERS.

220
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,898
I HOPE YOU'RE READY,

221
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,858
BECAUSE THE THIRD
BULLET OF BULLETS

222
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,860
PRELIMINARY TOURNAMENT
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

223
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,780
WHEN THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK
REACHES ZERO,

224
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,242
ALL COMPETING PLAYERS WILL BE
AUTOMATICALLY TRANSPORTED

225
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,078
TO THEIR RESPECTIVE
FIRST‐ROUND FIELD MAPS.

226
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,538
GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL.

227
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,582
‐ Players: (CHEERING)
‐ (GUNS FIRING)

228
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,047
Sinon: YOU BETTER
MAKE IT TO THE FINALS,

229
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,591
'CAUSE I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO BLOWING YOUR HEAD OFF.

230
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,719
Kirito: I ACCEPT THE INVITATION,

231
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,846
BUT DON'T KEEP ME
WAITING TOO LONG.

232
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,557
Sinon: (GASPS) WHY, YOU...

233
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,646
Kirito: HEH.

234
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,606
Sinon: (GROWLS)

235
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,530
Kirito: MAYBE I WENT
A LITTLE TOO FAR THERE.

236
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:28,099
Sinon: THIS TIME, I'LL KILL
ALL THE STRONG PLAYERS.

237
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,186
Kirito: IS THAT POSSIBLE?

238
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,230
COULD SHE BE DEATH GUN?

239
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,067
I SAW TWO SIDES OF HER,

240
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,028
BUT WHICH IS THE REAL SINON?

241
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,698
I WON'T FIND OUT
STANDING HERE,

242
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,116
THINKING ABOUT IT.

243
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,869
BUT IF WE CROSSED SWORDS‐‐

244
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,288
I MEAN TRADED SHOTS,

245
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,999
I'M SURE I'LL FIND THE ANSWER.

246
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,716
Kirito: (GASPS)

247
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,272
I CAN'T DODGE ALL THOSE BULLETS.

248
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,364
AT THIS RATE,
I'LL NEVER GET CLOSER TO HIM.

249
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,039
MAYBE IF I COULD USE
MY SWORD TO DEFLECT THE BULLETS,

250
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,541
I COULD GET CLOSER.

251
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,543
THEY'RE FLYING
TOO DAMN FAST, THOUGH.

252
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,882
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN PREDICT
THE TRAJECTORY OF EACH BULLET.

253
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,894
NO, I CAN DO THIS.

254
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,563
THE BULLET LINES TELL ME

255
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,107
EXACTLY WHAT PATH
THE BULLETS ARE TRAVELING.

256
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,495
(GRASS RUSTLING)

257
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,085
(GASPS) NOW!

258
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,721
Uemaru: HOLY CRAP!

259
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,684
Kirito: JUST A LITTLE FURTHER.

260
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,203
Uemaru: (SCREAMING)

261
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,063
Kirito: (GROANS)
DAMN IT.

262
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,029
OH, MAN.

263
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,989
(FANFARE PLAYING)

264
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:44,165
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE
TO DO THIS FOUR MORE TIMES.

265
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,184
I WONDER WHERE SINON IS.

266
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,858
Death Gun:
ARE YOU THE REAL DEAL?

267
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,006
Kirito: THE REAL DEAL?

268
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,008
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

269
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,885
WHO ARE YOU?

270
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,649
Death Gun: I SAW YOUR MATCH.

271
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,984
YOU TOOK HIM OUT WITH A SWORD.

272
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,653
Kirito: YEAH. SO WHAT?

273
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,823
IT'S NOT AGAINST THE RULES,
IS IT?

274
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,450
Death Gun: I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN.

275
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,995
ARE YOU THE REAL DEAL?

276
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,622
Kirito: WAIT.

277
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,833
DOES HE KNOW ME?

278
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,920
NO WAY.

279
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,715
WE HAVE MET BEFORE.

280
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,093
WE'VE BEEN FACE‐TO‐FACE
LIKE THIS,

281
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:23,681
BUT WHERE?
WHERE DO I KNOW HIM FROM?

282
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,571
Death Gun: WITH THAT NAME

283
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,282
AND YOUR SWORD SKILLS,

284
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,202
ARE YOU THE REAL DEAL OR WHAT?

285
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,497
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

286
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,339
Kirito: IF HE KNOWS ME,
I SHOULD KNOW HIM.

287
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,511
THAT'S IT.

288
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,556
HE'S AN "S. A. O." SURVIVOR.

289
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,021
WHO IS HE,

290
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,857
AND WHERE DID WE MEET
IN "S. A. O."?

291
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,949
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
