00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,945
SO IT'S BETTER
IF I FACE HIM ALONE.

178
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,699
Sinon: THEN YOU'RE
SCARED OF HIM, TOO?

179
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,868
Kirito: YEAH, I AM.

180
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,453
IF IT WAS THE OLD ME,

181
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,913
I WOULD HAVE JUMPED RIGHT IN
AND FOUGHT HIM,

182
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,624
EVEN IF THERE WAS A CHANCE
I WAS GONNA DIE,

183
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,001
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

184
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,004
THESE DAYS, THERE'S THINGS
I HAVE TO PROTECT.

185
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,630
I CAN'T DIE.

186
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,049
I DON'T WANT TO.

187
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,051
Sinon: THINGS YOU
HAVE TO PROTECT?

188
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,803
Kirito: YEAH,
IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD

189
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,472
AND THE REAL ONE, TOO.

190
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,265
Sinon: OKAY.

191
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,725
THEN DON'T GO AFTER HIM.

192
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,518
JUST STAY HERE, AND KEEP LOW.

193
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,439
AS LONG AS B. o. B.'S GOING ON,
WE CAN'T LOG OUT,

194
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,774
BUT ONCE THE COMPETITION'S

195
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,318
WHITTLED DOWN TO US
AND ONE OTHER PLAYER,

196
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,321
WE CAN SUICIDE OUT
AND LET THE OTHER GUY WIN.

197
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,572
THAT'LL END THE TOURNAMENT.

198
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,240
Kirito: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

199
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,910
I MEAN,
THAT'S ONE WAY OF DOING IT.

200
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,579
THING IS, IT'S NOT REALLY
A GOOD OPTION.

201
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,540
IF WE JUST SIT HERE
AND WAIT FOR THE TOURNEY TO END,

202
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,958
THERE'S NO TELLING

203
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,086
HOW MANY OTHER PLAYERS
THAT GUY'S GONNA KILL.

204
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,588
Sinon: YEAH.

205
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,511
(THINKING) YOU REALLY
ARE STRONG AFTER ALL.

206
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,516
I'M NOT GONNA HIDE EITHER.

207
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,434
Kirito: HUH?

208
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,769
Sinon: I'M GOING OUTSIDE

209
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,105
AND HELP YOU
TAKE THAT BASTARD OUT.

210
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,398
Kirito: NO, YOU'RE NOT.
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN LISTENING?

211
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,984
IF HE SHOOTS YOU,
THERE'S A CHANCE YOU'LL DIE.

212
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,070
AS A PLAYER,
CLOSE COMBAT'S MY SPECIALTY.

213
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,279
IT'S NOT YOURS.

214
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,323
YOU'RE IN WAY MORE DANGER
THAN ME,

215
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,117
'CAUSE HE CAN BE
INVISIBLE IF HE WANTS.

216
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,786
HE'LL POP UP NEXT TO YOU,
AND BANG.

217
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,080
Sinon: I DON'T CARE IF I DIE.

218
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,373
Kirito: (GASPS)

219
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,708
Sinon: I WAS SCARED
OUT OF MY MIND

220
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,001
BACK AT THE STADIUM.

221
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,337
I WAS SCARED I WAS GONNA DIE.

222
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,382
I WAS EVEN WEAKER
THAN I WAS FIVE YEARS AGO,

223
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,135
LIKE A SCREAMING,
CRYING LITTLE GIRL.

224
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:31,139
IF THAT'S HOW I'M GONNA BE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

225
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,473
I'D RATHER BE DEAD.

226
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,976
Kirito: IT'S ONLY NATURAL
TO BE AFRAID.

227
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,979
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF DYING.

228
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,148
Sinon: YEAH, WELL, I HATE IT.

229
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,608
I'M TIRED OF BEING AFRAID.

230
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,778
I'M SO TIRED.

231
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,904
WHATEVER.

232
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,240
I'M NOT ASKING TO GO WITH YOU.

233
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,075
I'LL FIGHT BY MYSELF.

234
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,872
Kirito: YOU WANT TO FIGHT ALONE
AND DIE ALONE.

235
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,248
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

236
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,083
Sinon: YEAH.

237
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,044
I WAS ALWAYS
SUPPOSED TO DIE ALONE.

238
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,130
(GRUNTS) LET GO.

239
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,798
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

240
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,467
Kirito: YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.

241
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,052
THERE'S NO DYING ALONE.

242
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,679
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

243
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,931
WHEN YOU DIE, YOU LEAVE A HOLE

244
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,309
IN ALL THE PEOPLE
WHOSE LIVES YOU WERE PART OF,

245
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,103
AND LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU'RE PART OF MINE NOW.

246
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,398
Sinon: YEAH, WELL, I NEVER
ASKED TO BE A PART OF IT.

247
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,401
BESIDES, MY LIFE'S
NO ONE ELSE'S BUSINESS BUT MINE.

248
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,861
Kirito: YOU'RE WRONG.

249
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,905
WE'RE INVOLVED
IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES NOW.

250
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,115
Sinon: (GASPS)

251
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,909
ALL RIGHT!

252
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,327
IF THAT'S HOW IT IS,

253
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,412
THEN YOU CAN PROTECT ME
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

254
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,917
(CRYING)

255
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,880
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,

256
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,548
AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING,

257
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,176
SO DON'T GO SAYING
STUFF LIKE THAT!

IT'S MINE!

259

MINE! YOU GOT THAT?!

260
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,018
EVEN IF I LOSE, EVEN IF I DIE,

261
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,772
NO ONE CAN BLAME ME
FOR WHAT I DID.

262
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,565
YOU WANT TO HELP?

263
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,984
YOU GONNA CARRY
THIS BURDEN WITH ME?

264
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,861
THEN WHAT, HUH?

First boy:
EWW. DON'T TOUCH ME.

274
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,471
YOU'LL GET ME ALL BLOODY.

275

KILL YOURSELF?

276

EVEN THOUGH I HATE YOUR GUTS,

286
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,490
CAN I BORROW YOUR LAP FOR A SEC?

287
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,917
I...

288
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:53,546
I KILLED SOMEONE.

289
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:57,383
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO,

290
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:59,385
IN A SMALL TOWN UP NORTH,

291
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:02,054
THIS GUY TRIED TO ROB
A POST OFFICE.

292
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,016
THE NEWS SAID THE ROBBER DIED

293
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:07,768
'CAUSE HIS GUN
WENT OFF ACCIDENTALLY.

294
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:11,731
BUT THE TRUTH IS I WAS THERE.

295
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:15,234
I GRABBED HIS GUN
AND SHOT HIM DEAD.

296
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,528
Kirito: HOW OLD WERE YOU?

297
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,988
Sinon: 11 YEARS OLD.

298
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,991
AND EVER SINCE THEN,
WHENEVER I SEE A GUN,

299
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:24,911
I START THROWING UP,
AND THEN I PASS OUT.

300
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:28,998
IF I SEE A GUN,
I SEE THE FACE OF THE ROBBER

301
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,585
THE WAY HE LOOKED
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

302
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:35,296
AND THEN I‐‐I GET SO SCARED.

303
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:36,422
Kirito: REALLY?

304
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:38,883
Sinon: YEAH, BUT IN THIS WORLD,

305
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:41,052
I DON'T HAVE THOSE PROBLEMS,

306
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,387
AND THAT GOT ME THINKING.

307
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,891
IF I CAN BECOME THE STRONGEST
PLAYER IN THE GAME,

308
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:49,310
THEN I'LL BE STRONG I. R. L., TOO,

309
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:51,646
AND MAYBE EVEN FORGET
WHAT I DID.

310
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:53,731
BUT JUST NOW‐‐

311
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:57,568
I MEAN, WHEN DEATH GUN
HAD ME PINNED,

312
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,736
I WAS TERRIFIED.

313
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:00,196
AND JUST LIKE THAT,

314
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:02,490
I WASN'T SINON ANYMORE.

315
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:04,909
I WAS THE REAL ME AGAIN.

316
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:09,246
I'M SCARED TO DIE. I AM.

317
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:12,875
ALTHOUGH, WHAT'S WORSE
IS LIVING WITH THIS FEAR.

318
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:15,294
IT'S SO PAINFUL,
I'D RATHER BE DEAD.

319
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:20,257
BUT I KNOW IF I RUN AWAY
FROM DEATH GUN AND MY PAST,

320
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:23,010
I'LL END UP WEAKER THAN BEFORE.

321
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:25,388
I WILL. I KNOW IT.

322
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:27,223
Kirito: YEAH.

323
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,350
I GET IT.

324
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:31,644
I KILLED SOMEONE ONCE, TOO.

325
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:32,687
Sinon: WHAT?

326
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:35,314
Kirito: I MENTIONED IT ONCE,

327
00:20:35,356 --> 00:20:37,817
'BOUT HOW I KNEW DEATH GUN.

328
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:41,278
WE FOUGHT BEFORE WHEN WE
WERE STUCK IN ANOTHER GAME.

329
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,115
I'M SURE YOU HEARD OF IT,

330
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:46,742
"SWORD ART ONLINE."

331
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,789
Sinon: OH, MY GOD. I KNEW IT.

332
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:55,292
Kirito: YEAH,
I'M A SURVIVOR OF "S. A. O.,"

333
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:58,295
AND SO IS DEATH GUN,
AND BACK THEN,

334
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,965
HE WAS A RED PLAYER
IN THIS GUILD.

335
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:03,968
THEY CALLED THEMSELVES
LAUGHING COFFIN, P.K.ERS.

336
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:07,054
THEY HAD TO BE STOPPED,

337
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:09,056
SO ONE DAY, A PARTY WAS FORMED

338
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,891
TO CATCH 'EM
AND HAUL 'EM OFF TO PRISON.

339
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,185
I WAS IN THAT PARTY.

340
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:17,106
(SHUDDERS)

341
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:20,860
THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT OUR PLANS,
AND THEY AMBUSHED US,

342
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:24,822
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAOS,
I KILLED TWO OF LAUGHING COFFIN.

343
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,574
I JUST...

344
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:28,034
CUT 'EM DOWN.

(SIGHS)

346
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:36,751
AND OVER TIME,

347
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:40,087
I MANAGED TO FORCE MYSELF
TO FORGET WHAT I DID,

348
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:41,714
TILL YESTERDAY,

349
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:44,884
WHEN I RAN INTO THE GUY
CALLING HIMSELF DEATH GUN.

350
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:46,469
Sinon: AND THERE'S NO DOUBT

351
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,679
HE WAS WITH LAUGHING COFFIN
THAT DAY?

352
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:51,098
YOU'RE SURE
HE WAS PART OF THAT AMBUSH?

353
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,101
Kirito: I AM,
ABOUT AS SURE AS I'LL EVER BE.

354
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:57,438
HE'S ONE OF THE PLAYERS
WE TOOK TO PRISON THAT DAY.

355
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,066
THAT'S WHY, NO MATTER WHAT,

356
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:03,069
I HAVE TO SETTLE THINGS
WITH HIM IN HERE

357
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,446
IN THIS WORLD.
