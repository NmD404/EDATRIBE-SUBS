THE MORE IT SEEMED
THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.

THE OTHER PLAYERS IN "GGO"

169
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,742
TREATED IT
LIKE SOME KIND OF JOKE.

170
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,036
Kirito: SHOICHI AND HIS PARTNERS
WERE FURIOUS,

171
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,371
SO THEY DECIDED
TO KILL SOME PLAYERS

172
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,956
DURING THE B. o. B FINAL.

173
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,958

00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,768
FOR JUST THE TWO OF THEM,
THOUGH.

178
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,562
Kikuoka: YEAH.
TO BE IN SYNC WITH DEATH GUN,

179
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,523
THE PERSON DOING
THE REAL‐WORLD KILLING

180
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,400
HAD TO MAKE SURE THEY'D BE
AT EACH TARGET'S HOUSE ON TIME.

181
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,195
Kirito: SO THEY RECRUITED THAT
KANAMOTO GUY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT

182
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,198
TO BE THE THIRD DEATH GUN.
WHERE'D THEY FIND HIM, THOUGH?

183
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,827
Kikuoka: SIMPLE. KANAMOTO WAS
AN OLD FRIEND OF SHOICHI'S.

184
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,663
THEY WERE BOTH PART
OF LAUGHING COFFIN IN "S. A. O."

185
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,499
WE FOUND OUT HIS HANDLE THERE
WAS JOHNNY BLACK.

186
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,959
THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?

187
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,919
Kirito: YEAH.
HE WORKED WITH XAXA.

188
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,172
I THINK HIS WEAPON OF CHOICE
WAS A POISON KNIFE.

189
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,969
Kikuoka: THEY PUT KANAMOTO
ON PALE RIDER AND GARRETT,

190
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,679
'CAUSE HE LIVED NEARBY.

191
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,181
SINON, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WAS KYOJI'S.

192
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,560
SEE, SHOICHI WAS THE ONE
WHO USUALLY DID THE KILLING,

193
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,145
BUT FOR THIS ONE JOB,

194
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,647
KYOJI INSISTED ON BEING
THE ONE TO DO IT.

195
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,857
‐ Sinon: UM...
‐ Kikuoka: HMM?

196
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,360
Sinon: IS THAT
WHAT HE WANTED FOR REAL?

197
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,904
DID SHINKA‐‐
I MEAN KYOJI SAY THAT?

198
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,698
Kikuoka: NO.
HIS BROTHER WAS THE ONE

199
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,117
WHO GAVE US
ALL THE DETAILS OF THEIR PLAN.

200
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,827
KYOJI STILL REFUSES TO TALK.

201
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,370
Sinon: HE DOES, HUH?

202
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,789
Kikuoka: SPEAKING OF,

203
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,958
WE FOUND OUT
A LITTLE MORE ABOUT SHOICHI.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,294
HEALTHWISE, HE'D BEEN
SICKLY SINCE CHILDHOOD.

205
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,963
HIS FATHER PRETTY MUCH
GAVE UP ON HIM,

206
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,423
SO HE DECIDED EARLY ON

207
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,258
TO HAND THE HOSPITAL OVER
TO KYOJI.

208
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,136
Kyoji: STAYING SHARP, MA'AM,
LOCKED AND LOADED.

209
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,224
Kikuoka: EVEN SO, THE BROTHERS
SEEMED TO BE CLOSE GROWING UP,

210
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,436
BUT THEN SHOICHI
GOT OBSESSED WITH MMORPGs,

211
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:31,191
AND IN 2022, HE GOT TRAPPED
IN "SWORD ART ONLINE."

212
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,152
AFTER HE GOT OUT,

213
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,362
SHOICHI ONLY SPOKE
TO KYOJI ABOUT IT.

214
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,531
HE BRAGGED ABOUT HOW,
IN THAT WORLD,

215
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,576
HE WAS A REAL MASS MURDERER
AND HOW HE WAS FEARED.

216
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:45,538
IN KYOJI'S EYES,
HIS BIG BROTHER WAS A HERO.

217
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,041
AS FOR SHOICHI,
HE'S STICKING WITH THE STORY

218
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,126
THAT EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE DEATH GUN CONCEPT,

219
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,712
INCLUDING THE MURDERS,
WAS JUST PART OF A GAME,

220
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,339
THAT HIS ACTIONS HERE,

221
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,091
LIKE GATHERING INTEL ON VICTIMS,
PREPPING FOR THE MURDERS,

222
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,969
AND COMMITTING THEM, WERE
NO DIFFERENT THAN IN "S. A. O."

223
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,555
Kirito: THE DARK SIDE OF VRMMOs,

224
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,098
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

225
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,851
HIS REALITY GOT A LOT LESS REAL.

226
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,437
Kikuoka: YEAH. GOOD POINT.

227
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,565
AND HOW ARE YOU HANDLING YOURS?

228
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,694
Kirito: I FEEL LIKE I LEFT
A PART OF ME BACK IN "S. A. O.,"

229
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,531
SO RIGHT NOW, THERE'S LESS OF ME
HERE THAN THERE WAS BEFORE.

230
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,532
I DON'T KNOW.

231
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,617
Kikuoka: YOU DON'T KNOW?

232
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,993
DO YOU WANNA GO BACK?

233
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,746
Kirito: SERIOUSLY?
HOW COULD YOU ASK ME THAT?

234
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,498
Sinon: UM, WAIT A SEC.

235
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,084
YOU'RE KIND OF CONTRADICTING
WHAT YOU TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY.

236
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,377
Kirito: WHAT?

237
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,545
Sinon: YOU SAID
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

238
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,214
AS A VIRTUAL WORLD, REMEMBER?

239
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,050
THAT, LIKE, WHEREVER YOU WERE,
THAT'S YOUR REALITY.

240
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,094
WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW, HERE,

241
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,973
THIS WORLD IS MY REALITY.

242
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,892
AND EVEN IF YOU TOLD ME
THIS WAS A VIRTUAL WORLD,

243
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,019
IT WOULD STILL BE REALITY TO ME.

244
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,521
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

245
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,232
Kirito: I GUESS.

246
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,067
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

247
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,860
I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU, SINON.

248
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,529
WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW

249
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,198
MIGHT BE THE ONLY GOOD THING
TO COME OUT OF THIS NIGHTMARE.

250
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,658
Sinon: OH, PUT A SOCK IN IT.

251
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,745
Kikuoka: SORRY,
I'M WITH KIRITO ON THIS ONE.

252
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,290
WELL, I TOLD YOU PRETTY MUCH

253
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,958
ALL WE'VE FOUND OUT SO FAR.

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,793
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
BEFORE I GO?

255
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,129
Sinon: I DO.
HAS THERE BEEN ANY WORD

256
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,214
ON WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO KYOJI YET?

257
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,468
Kikuoka: BASED ON HIS BROTHER'S
CONFESSION AND THEIR BEHAVIOR,

258
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,556
THEY'LL MOST LIKELY BE SENT
TO A MEDICAL DETENTION CENTER.

259
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,018
I DOUBT EITHER ONE KNOWS
WHAT REALITY IS ANYMORE.

260
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,769
Sinon: NO,
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

261
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,438
Kikuoka: HMM?

262
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,857
Sinon: I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT KYOJI'S BROTHER.

263
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,025
I NEVER MET HIM.

264
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,193
BUT I'VE KNOWN KYOJI
A LONG TIME,

265
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,447
AND, WELL, I THINK HIS REALITY
WAS "GUN GALE ONLINE."

266
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,284
HE HAD PRETTY MUCH GIVEN UP
ON THIS WORLD.

267
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,495
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HIM
OTHER THAN "GGO,"

268
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,622
SO HE MADE THAT HIS REALITY.

269
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,542
HE'D SPEND HOURS IN IT
GRINDING AWAY,

270
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,587
BOOSTING HIS XP,
AND TRYING TO BE THE BEST.

271
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,757
I GUESS THE STRESS
GOT TO BE TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

272
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,467
Kikuoka: FROM PLAYING A GAME?

273
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,386
I KNOW YOU CAN LOSE TRACK
OF TIME, BUT REALITY?

274
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,346
Sinon: SURE. AT SOME POINT,

275
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,016
KYOJI JUST SWAPPED OUT
ONE FOR THE OTHER,

276
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,643
HIS REAL LIFE
FOR HIS VIRTUAL ONE.

277
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,896
Kikuoka: OKAY, BUT WHY?

278
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,230
Sinon: I DON'T KNOW,

279
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,399
BUT I WISH I DID.

280
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,861
KIRITO, WHY DO YOU
THINK HE DID IT?

281
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,946
Kirito: TO GET STRONGER.

282
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,157
Sinon: YOU'RE RIGHT.

283
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,867
I GUESS I WAS THE SAME WAY.

284
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,036
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

285
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,872
MAYBE ALL US VRMMO PLAYERS
ARE THE SAME.

286
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,583
ALL WE WANT IS TO GET STRONGER.

287
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,877
MR. KIKUOKA,

288
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,630
I'D LIKE TO GO SEE HIM
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

289
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,548
THERE'S SO MUCH
I WANT TO TELL HIM,

290
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,300
LIKE WHAT WE WERE
JUST TALKING ABOUT

291
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,178
AND OTHER STUFF I'VE
BEEN THINKING, IF IT'S OKAY.

292
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,972
Kikuoka: MM. YOU'RE
A STRONG PERSON TO WANT TO,

293
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,850
AND I, FOR ONE,
THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

294
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,435
HE CAN'T HAVE VISITORS YET,

295
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,854
BUT WHEN HE CAN,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

296
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,358
WELL, I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE NOW.

297
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,902
Kirito: OKAY.
THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME.

298
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,488
Sinon: YES, THANK YOU
FOR TALKING TO US.

299
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,031
Kikuoka: DON'T EVEN MENTION IT.

300
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,574
YOU GUYS RISKED YOUR LIVES,

301
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,368
AND GOD KNOWS
HOW MANY YOU SAVED.

302
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,828
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.

303
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,289
OH, BY THE WAY, KIRITO,

304
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,668
DEATH GUN OR SHOICHI SHINKAWA
OR RED‐EYED XAXA

305
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,796
OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL HIM
ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU A MESSAGE.

306
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,881
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT,

307
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,300
SAY THE WORD,
AND I'LL TEAR IT UP.

308
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,096
Kirito: I'LL HEAR IT.

309
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,472
Kikuoka: YOU GOT IT.

310
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,933
HE WROTE,

311
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,352
"IF YOU THINK THIS IS OVER,
IT'S NOT.

312
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,980
YOU DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO END THIS.

313
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,773
SOONER OR LATER,
YOU'LL REALIZE THAT.

314
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,900
IT'S SHOWTIME."

315
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,694
THAT'S IT.

316
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,627
Kirito: HEY, UH, SINON.

317
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,546
Sinon: HMM? WHAT'S UP?

318
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,090
Kirito: ARE YOU FREE RIGHT NOW?

319
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,551
Sinon: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "FREE"?

320
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,052
FREE FOR WHAT?

321
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,972
(MOTORCYCLE REVS)

322
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,146
SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU'RE TAKING ME?

323
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,773
Kirito: YEP. THERE'S SOMEONE
INSIDE I WANT YOU TO MEET.

324
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,235
Lisbeth: WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

325
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,945
YOU MADE US WAIT SO DARN LONG,

326
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,947
I WENT AND HAD
TWO SLICES OF APPLE PIE.

327
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,617
IF I GET FAT,
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

328
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,911
Kirito: HOW'S THAT
MY FAULT? JEEZ.

329
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,580
Asuna: COME ON, KIRITO.

330
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,916
ARE YOU GONNA INTRODUCE US
OR WHAT?

331
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,648
Kirito: HUH? OH, RIGHT. SORRY.

332
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,276
THIS IS SHINO ASADA,
A. K. A. SINON,

333
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:47,778
"GUN GALE ONLINE'S"
THIRD SUPER‐CHAMP.

334
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,405
Sinon: OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

335
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:50,615
Lisbeth: (GROANS)

336
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,575
Kirito: (CLEARS THROAT)

337
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:55,745
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS
FROM MY TIME IN "S. A. O.,"

338
00:16:55,786 --> 00:16:58,706
RIKA, A. K. A. LIZ,
BLACKSMITH AND SWINDLER.

339
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:01,292
Lisbeth: HUH?
WHAT THE HELL'D YOU CALL ME?

340
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:02,835
HAH! (GROANS)

341
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:04,837
Kirito: AND THAT'S ASUNA,
THE BERSERK HEALER,
