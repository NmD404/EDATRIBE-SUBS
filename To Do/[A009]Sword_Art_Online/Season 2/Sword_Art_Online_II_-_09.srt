00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,646
Leafa: HMM, WHERE'S KAZUTO?

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,731
HE SHOULD HAVE SHOWN UP BY NOW.

5
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,024
Silica: MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE

6
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,068
ALL THE BATTLES UP
ON THE FEED YET.

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,320
I MEAN, KNOWING KIRITO,
WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,113
RUNNING AROUND,
GUNS BLAZING FROM THE START.

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,698
Klein: I DON'T KNOW.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,034
HE'S ONE OF THE CRAFTIEST
PLAYERS I'VE EVER MET.

11
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,577
HE'S PROBABLY
LAYING LOW SOMEWHERE,

12
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,413
WAITING FOR THE COMPETITION
TO KILL EACH OTHER OFF.

13
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,874
Asuna: OH, PLEASE.

14
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,918
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
HE DOESN'T PLAY LIKE THAT.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,919
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, YUI?

16
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:44,920
Yui: ABSOLUTELY.

17
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,213
BESIDES, DADDY'S SO FAST,

18
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,507
I DOUBT HE'LL EVEN
SHOW UP ON CAMERA.

19
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,841
HE'LL SNEAK UP AND STRIKE

20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,343
BEFORE HIS ENEMY
KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

21
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,720
Lisbeth: (LAUGHS)
HE CAN'T DO IT ANY OTHER WAY.

22
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,598
I MEAN, IT'S A GAME WITH GUNS,
AND HE'S USING A SWORD.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,599
WHAT A DOOFUS.

24
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,809
All: (LAUGH)

25
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,270

Asuna: HUH?

29
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,027

Lisbeth: YEAH.

36
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:38,974

IS FULL OF SUCK, LIZ.

40
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,734
Lisbeth: SHUT UP.
HE'S NOT OUT OF IT YET.

41
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,197
Silica: WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

42
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,160
Yui: IT'S SOME KIND
OF PARALYSIS ATTACK,

43
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,911
MOST LIKELY TEMPORARY.

44
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,622
Leafa: IT'S LIKE HE WAS HIT

45
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,374

Kirito: IT'S THE GUY
IN THE CLOAK.

51
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,642
THERE'S NO TIME! SHOOT HIM!

52
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,643
HURRY!

53
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,854
DON'T LET HIM FIRE THAT GUN!

Sinon: (GASPS)

55
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,117
OH, CRAP.

56
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,869
HE KNEW I WAS HERE.

57
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,287
Kirito: HOW COULD HE?

58
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,289
Sinon: MAYBE HE
SPOTTED ME EARLIER,

59
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,666
GOT MY POSITION
FROM THE LAST SCAN.

60
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,866

Girls: (GASP)

64
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,522
Death Gun:
DEATH GUN IS MY NAME

65
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,942
AND THE NAME OF MY GUN.

66
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:06,199
ONE DAY,
I'LL PAY YOU ALL A VISIT, TOO,

67
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,745
AND BRING REAL DEATH
WITH THIS GUN.

68
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,248
YOU'VE SEEN MY POWER.

69
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,875
IT IS REAL.

70
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,962
THIS ISN'T OVER, NOT YET.

71
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,048
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

72
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,094
IT'S SHOWTIME.

73
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,850
Asuna: I'VE MET
THAT PERSON BEFORE.

74
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,143
BUT WHERE?

75
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,563
THERE'S ONLY
ONE PLACE I COULD'VE,

76
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,106
AINCRAD.

77
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,775
Girls: (GASP)

78
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,320

THE HELL OUTTA EVERYONE.

Klein: YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

80
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,574
NO WAY. CAN'T BE.

81
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,242
Asuna: YOU KNOW HIM, TOO?

82
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,910
DO YOU REMEMBER HIS NAME?

83
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:56,249
Klein: NO. I FORGET THE HANDLE
HE USED, BUT IT'S HIM.

84
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,876
THERE'S NO DOUBT.

85
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,502
HE WAS IN LAUGHING COFFIN.

86
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,299
Asuna: LAUGHING COFFIN.

87
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,800
WAS HE THEIR LEADER?

88
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,844
YOU KNOW, THE KNIFE WIELDER?

89
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,180
Klein: NO.
PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT POH.

90
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,808
SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THIS GUY
TALKS AND ACTS IS DIFFERENT.

91
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,729
EXCEPT FOR
THAT "SHOWTIME" LINE, THOUGH.

92
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,523
POH WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO SAID THAT.

93
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,234
BUT THIS GUY,
HE WAS CLOSE TO POH.

94
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,861
I'M TALKING
RIGHT‐HAND‐MAN CLOSE.

95
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,530
Asuna: KIRITO.

96
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,287

OH, YEAH. THAT'S DEATH GUN.

98
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,540
Sinon: DEATH GUN?

99
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,667
YOU'RE JOKING.

100
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,627
YOU MEAN
THOSE RUMORS ABOUT PLAYERS

101
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,296
GETTING SHOT AND DISAPPEARING,
THOSE ARE ALL TRUE?

102
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,381
Kirito: YEAH, THEY ARE.

103
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,633
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DOES IT YET,

104
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,302
BUT HE'S BEEN KILLING PLAYERS
IN THE REAL WORLD.

105
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,303
Sinon: THAT'S INSANE!

106
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,471
Kirito: IT'S NOT.

107
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,307
TWO PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED DEAD.

108
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,614
WHERE'D HE GO?

109
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,574
(WATCH ALARM BEEPING)

110
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,664
Sinon: KIRITO,
WATCH THE BRIDGE FOR A SEC.

111
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,126
I'M GONNA CHECK THE SCAN AND
SEE WHAT NAME HE'S GOING BY.

112
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,460
Kirito: YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

113
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,307
Sinon: HUH?

114
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,393
WHERE IS HE?

115
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,645
COULD HE HAVE MOVED THAT FAST?

116
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,022
NO.

117
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,316
THIS IS OUR CHANCE.

118
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,317
Kirito: FOR WHAT?

119
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,694
Sinon: YOUR PAL IN THE CLOAK

120
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,070
ISN'T SHOWING UP
ON THE TERMINAL.

121
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,281
MY GUESS IS
HE JUMPED IN THE RIVER.

122
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,615
IF I'M RIGHT,

123
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,285
THEN HE HAD TO DISABLE
HIS GEAR LIKE YOU DID.

124
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,828
Kirito: WHAT ABOUT HIS HANDGUN?

125
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,247
HE CAN STILL MOVE UNDERWATER
WITH THAT EQUIPPED, RIGHT?

126
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,416
Sinon: EVEN IF HE COULD,
IT'S JUST ONE LITTLE HANDGUN.

127
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,251
I COULD TAKE HIM OUT EASY
WITH MY HECATE.

128
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,128
Kirito: YOU CAN'T!

129
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,504
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.

130
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,507
HE USED THAT LITTLE GUN
TO KILL PALE RIDER.

131
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,217
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE SHOT.

132
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,803
GET IT? ONE SHOT,
AND YOU'RE DEAD FOR REAL!

133
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,267
Sinon: YEAH, WELL,
I'M NOT BUYING IT.

134
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,227
HOW'S IT EVEN POSSIBLE?

135
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,230
I MEAN, A PLAYER
KILLING PEOPLE I. R. L.?

136
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,485
Kirito: I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

137
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,279
THIS DEATH GUN GUY
KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE

138
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,156
IN THAT V. R. M. M. O. I WAS IN.

139
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,450
WHEN HE USED HIS SWORD
ON SOMEONE,

140
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,827
HE KNEW HE WAS
REALLY KILLING 'EM.

141
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,998
AND SO DID I.

142
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,672

JUST A LITTLE FREAKED OUT.

150
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,489
ANYWAY, I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED
WHAT YOU TOLD ME'S POSSIBLE,

151
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,201
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
LYING TO ME ABOUT IT, EITHER.

152
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,536
Kirito: THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

153

I CAN'T ASK FOR MORE.

154
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,291
Sinon: YEAH, WELL, WE BETTER
GET OUT OF THE AREA ASAP.

THE OTHERS KNOW
WE'RE HERE BY NOW.

THEY THINK WE'RE BUSY
FIGHTING EACH OTHER,

157
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,422
SO THEY'LL BE CLOSING IN SOON.

158

Kirito: YOU GOT A POINT.

159
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,801

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

SEEMS PRETTY TOUGH,

AND IF HE KILLS YOU,
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIGHT ME.

178
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,590
Kirito: I DON'T THINK YOU GET‐‐

179
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,592
Sinon: LOOK, I'M NOT
A FAN OF TEAMING UP, EITHER,

180
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,218
BUT I THINK
WE STAND A BETTER CHANCE

181
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,845
OF KNOCKING THAT GUY
OUT OF THE GAME

182
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,096
IF WE WORK TOGETHER.

183
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,307
Kirito:
NO, I'M NOT DOWN WITH THAT.

184
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,058
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

185
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,853
Sinon: WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE'LL POP UP NEXT,

186
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,023
SO IT'LL BE DANGEROUS
WHETHER WE'RE TOGETHER OR NOT.

187
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,485
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

188
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,586
Kakouton: HUH?

189
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,797
Kirito: WE BETTER
TAKE CARE OF THIS JOKER.

190
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,508
I'LL BLOCK HIS BULLETS.
YOU WAIT FOR AN OPENING.

191
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,680
Sinon: ROGER THAT.

192
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,486
Kirito: HE'S ALL YOURS!

193
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,786
Kakouton: NO WAY.

194
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,267
Kirito: DEATH GUN'S PROBABLY
HEADING NORTH UP THE RIVER.

195
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,394
I WANNA BE THERE
WHEN HE SURFACES,

196
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,562
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE'LL STOP.

197
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,106
GOT ANY IDEAS, SINON?

198
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,149
Sinon: UH...

199
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,404
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOT
ANY OTHER SPECIAL SKILLS,

200
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,823
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,
HE'S A SNIPER.

201
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,451
HE'S GONNA AVOID OPEN SPACES
AND LOOK FOR A PLACE WITH COVER.

202
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,872
IF I WERE HIM, I'D SET MYSELF UP
IN THE RUINS OF THAT CITY.

203
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,834
Kirito: GOOD. THEN THAT'S
WHERE YOU AND ME ARE GONNA GO.

204
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,463
Sinon: ON YOUR SIX.

205
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,733
Klein: IN "S. A. O.,"
WE HAD A CODE.

206
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,485
NEVER LET ANOTHER PLAYER'S H. P.
HIT ZERO,

207
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,862
NO MATTER WHAT.

208
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,197
WE KNEW
IF IT DROPPED TO NOTHING,

209
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,867
THAT PLAYER WOULD DIE.

210
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,578
LAUGHING COFFIN DIDN'T CARE.

211
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,121
THEY KILLED DOZENS‐‐

212
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,789
NO, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

213
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,460
THE ASSAULT TEAM
HAD TO STEP IN.

214
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,211
THEY PUT A PARTY TOGETHER

215
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,131
TO HUNT 'EM DOWN
AND CAPTURE THEM.

216
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,134
Leafa: AND KAZUTO
WAS THERE WITH YOU?

217
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,888
Kirito: YEAH. HE WAS UP FRONT,
GOING TOE TO TOE.

218
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,474
EVERYTHING WENT TO HELL
PRETTY FAST.

219
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,100
Leafa: OH, MAN.

220
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,644
THAT'S WHY KAZUTO'S
BEEN ACTING SO WEIRD LATELY.

221
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,229
NOW I'M WORRIED.

222
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,066
MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO SETTLE
SOME GRUDGE OR SOMETHING

223
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,442
Lisbeth: GRUDGE?

224
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,736
ISN'T THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE A PART‐TIME JOB?

225
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,781
Asuna: SORRY.
I'M LOGGING OUT FOR A BIT.

226
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,365
Silica: WHY?

227
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,618
Asuna: I HAVE TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH KIRITO'S CLIENT.

228
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,411
Silica: WAIT. HE'S GOT A CLIENT?

229
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,623
Asuna: MM‐HMM. HE'S THE ONE WHO
GOT KIRITO TO DIVE INTO "GGO."

230
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,833
I BET HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.

231
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,587
OH, AND, YUI, I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR HELP WHILE I'M GONE.

232
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,798
FIND OUT
ANYTHING YOU CAN ABOUT "GGO."

233
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,758
Yui: YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, MOMMY!

234
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,385
Asuna: I'LL BE BACK
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

235
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,428
WISH ME LUCK.

236
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,032
Sinon: WHERE THE HECK DID HE GO?

237
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,743
YOU THINK WE MIGHT'VE PASSED HIM
ON THE WAY OVER HERE?

238
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,245
Kirito: NO, WE DIDN'T PASS HIM.

239
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,205
I WAS KEEPING AN EYE
ON THE RIVER

240
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,665
THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE RUNNING.

241
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,333
Sinon: OH.

242
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,001
WELL, THE RIVER DEAD‐ENDS HERE.

243
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,337
I GUESS
HE MUST BE LURKING AROUND

244
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,089
SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY NOW.

245
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,715
Kirito: OKAY.

246
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,052
LISTEN, WHEN HIS LOCATION
POPS UP IN THE NEXT SCAN,

247
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,930
WE'LL RUSH HIM
BEFORE HE CAN KILL ANYONE ELSE.

248
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,431
Sinon: I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

249
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,767
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM.

250
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,270
HOW WILL WE KNOW
WHO DEATH GUN IS?

251
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,939
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT
HIS AVATAR'S HANDLE, REMEMBER?

252
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,858
Kirito: UH, OH, YEAH. RIGHT.

253
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,360
THEN LET'S START
WITH WHAT WE KNOW.

254
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,864
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
THE NAMES OF THREE NEW PLAYERS.

255
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,533
IT'S NOT PALE RIDER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

256
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,453
THAT LEAVES US WITH TWO NAMES
IN PLAY THAT COULD BE DEATH GUN,

257
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,956
JUSHI X AND STERBEN.

258
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,167
Sinon: IF THEY'RE
BOTH IN THE CITY,

259
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,086
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO PICK THE WRONG ONE.

260
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,381
WAIT A SEC.
I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

261
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,634
IN JAPANESE, THE "SHI"
IN "JUSHI" MEANS DEATH.

262
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,635
GET IT?

263
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,637
AND THE "X" COULD MEAN CROSS,

264
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,806
LIKE MAKING
THE SIGN OF THE CROSS!

265
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,017
YOU THINK?
OR MAYBE IT'S TOO OBVIOUS

266
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,060
Kirito: HMM. MAYBE NOT.

267
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,230
AREN'T AVATAR NAMES
USUALLY SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS?

268
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,566
MINE'S A VARIATION
ON MY REAL NAME.

269
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:24,567
AND YOURS?

270
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,903
Sinon: YEAH, SAME HERE.

271
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,533
Kirito:
WELL, IF THEY'RE BOTH HERE,

272
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,535
WE'LL GO AFTER JUSHI X FIRST.

273
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:38,080
OH, AND IF I GET PARALYZED
LIKE PALE RIDER, DON'T PANIC.

274
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,582
GET INTO POSITION, AND WAIT.

275
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,167
Sinon: HUH?

276
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,044
Kirito: DEATH GUN'S PROBABLY
HIDING SOMEWHERE CLOSE.

277
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,296
WHEN HE COMES OUT
TO FINISH ME OFF,

278
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,547
THAT'S WHEN YOU SHOOT HIM.

279
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,009
Sinon: AREN'T YOU WORRIED
I'LL SHOOT YOU, TOO?

280
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,719
Kirito: ARE YOU KIDDING?

281
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,096
YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
I'D EXPECT TO PLAY IT LIKE THAT.

282
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,725
LET'S GO, PARTNER.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

283
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,279
Sinon: OKAY, BUT ONCE
WE GET HIM, ALL BETS ARE OFF!

284
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,629
KIRITO, CHECK THE NORTH SIDE
OF THE MAP.

285
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,556
IT'S HIM.

286
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,516
HE'S THE ONLY ONE IN THE CITY.

287
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,142
I GUESS HE'S OUR MAN, HUH.

288
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,978
Kirito: YEAH.
I DON'T SEE STERBEN AROUND.

289
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,606
THAT SETTLES IT. JUSHI X AND
DEATH GUN ARE ONE AND THE SAME.

290
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,024
THAT MEANS HE'S GOING AFTER...

291
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,901
HIM.

292
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,570
Sinon: WE BETTER MOVE FAST.

293
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,904
RICOCO'S ALMOST IN RANGE.

294
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,115
Kirito: YEAH.
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

295
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,449
Sinon: YUP.

296
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,264
FOUND HIM. UP THERE.

297
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,869
Kirito: HE'S PROBABLY
WAITING FOR RICOCO

298
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:30,260
TO WALK RIGHT UP
INTO HIS SIGHTS.

299
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:33,346
I'LL ATTACK JUSHI X FROM BEHIND
WHILE I GOT THE CHANCE.

300
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:35,181
THAT BUILDING
IN FRONT OF THE STADIUM

301
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:37,517
MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE
FOR YOU TO GET INTO POSITION.

302
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,061
Sinon: NO. I'M COMING WITH YOU.

303
00:18:40,103 --> 00:18:41,438
Kirito: NOT THIS TIME.

304
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:44,607
I CAN FIGHT WAY BETTER
KNOWING YOU GOT MY BACK.

305
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:45,984
WE'RE A TEAM, REMEMBER?

306
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:48,653
Sinon: MM‐HMM.

307
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:53,116
Kirito: ALL I'M GONNA NEED
IS 30 SECONDS TO GET UP THERE,

308
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:54,993
AND I'LL BE READY
TO TAKE HIM OUT.

309
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,494
IS THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU?

310
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,246
Sinon: MM‐HMM. PLENTY.

311
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,623
Kirito: COOL. SEE YOU IN A BIT.

312
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,341
Birds: (CAWING)

313
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:22,854
Sinon: SOON AS DEATH GUN'S GONE,
WE'LL BE ENEMIES AGAIN.

314
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,273
I'LL SHOOT HIM, BEAT HIM,

315
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:27,692
AND THEN FORGET HIM.

316
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,528
WHATEVER.

317
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,364
IT'S NOT LIKE I'LL EVER
SEE HIM AGAIN AFTER THIS.

318
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:43,249
WHAT?

319
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,257
BUT...

320
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,385
DEATH GUN'S SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE STADIUM.

321
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:05,230
(GASPS)

322
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:24,916
Death Gun:
KIRITO, WHEREVER YOU ARE,

323
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:29,754
IT'S TIME I FOUND OUT IF YOU'RE
THE REAL DEAL OR A FAKE.

324
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:34,342
I REMEMBER
HOW YOU FOUGHT BACK THEN,

325
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:37,470
ALL FURY AND RAGE.

326
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:40,723
IF I KILL THIS FRIEND OF YOURS

327
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:43,351
AND YOU GO BERSERK
LIKE I REMEMBER,

328
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:45,603
I'LL KNOW IT'S REALLY YOU.

329
00:20:46,604 --> 00:20:49,065
Sinon: HE'S GONNA KILL ME?

330
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,902
Death Gun: COME ON, KIRITO.

331
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:54,571
SHOW ME.

332
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:56,656
LET'S SEE YOUR FURY,

333
00:20:56,698 --> 00:20:58,992
YOUR RAGE,

334
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:02,203
YOUR INSANE SWORD.

335
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:05,665
SHOW ME FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

336
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:24,767
Sinon: A TYPE 54 BLACK STAR.

337
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,445
IT'S THE GUN.

338
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:38,489
WHY?

339
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,991
WHY HERE?

340
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,493
WHY DOES HE HAVE THAT GUN?

341
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:05,475
Robber: (LAUGHS)

342
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:07,935
(HEART BEATING)

343
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,487
(GUNSHOT ECHOES)
