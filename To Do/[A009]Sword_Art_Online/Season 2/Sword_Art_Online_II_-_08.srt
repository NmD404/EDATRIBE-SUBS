1
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:26,610
Death Gun: WHETHER YOU'RE
A FAKE USING HIS NAME

2
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,320
OR THE REAL GUY,

3
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,406
SOMEDAY I'LL KILL YOU.

4
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,252
Kirito: THE FIRST TIME
DEATH GUN SHOWED UP

5
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,587
WAS AFTER THE SECOND
BULLET OF BULLETS,

6
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,090
AND BOTH
OF THE MURDERS HE COMMITTED

7
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,551
HAPPENED IN FRONT
OF WITNESSES.

8
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,970
HE'S BEEN STAYING
UNDER THE RADAR

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,346
SINCE THE LAST KILLING,

10
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,016
PROBABLY LEVELING UP
AS MUCH AS HE CAN.

11
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,936
I DON'T SEE ANYONE REGISTERED
AS DEATH GUN HERE,

12
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,605
BUT IF HE WANTS
TO STAGE ANOTHER MURDER,

13
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,357
B.o.B.'s PERFECT.

14
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,984
HE'LL BE HERE.

15
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,485
I KNOW IT.

16
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,822
I GOTTA FIND OUT THE NAME
OF DEATH GUN'S AVATAR

17
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,864
AND STOP HIM.

18
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,266
Kirito: HEY.

19
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,935
HEY, SINON.

20
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,814
HELLO. ANYONE HOME?

21
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,358
‐ COME O‐‐
‐ Sinon: SHUT UP.

22
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,777
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR
I WAS DONE TALKING.

23
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,696
GOD, WHAT ELSE
DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

24
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,697
Kirito: N‐NOTHING.

25
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,490
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

26
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,159
MAYBE WE COULD SWAP SOME INFO
BEFORE THIS STARTS.

27
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,120
I MEAN...

28
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,081
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,501
Sinon: (SIGHS)

30
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,794
FINE. WHATEVER.

31
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:31,795
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

32
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,630
Sinon: I'LL DO IT,

33
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,341
EVEN THOUGH I'M THE ONE WHO'S
GONNA BE GIVING ALL THE INFO.

34
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,301
Kirito: BUT I GOT STUFF
TO SHARE, TOO.

35
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,928
IT'S NOT A LOT, BUT STILL...

36
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,601
(MUSIC PLAYING)

37
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,065
Interviewer:
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

38
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,692
YOU THINK YOU GOT A SHOT
THIS TIME?

39
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,319
Dyne: BY THE TIME HE SEES ME,
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

40
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,654
Kirito: THIS IS CRAZY.

41
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,781
Sinon: YEAH. THE FINAL
IS LIKE ONE BIG PARTY.

42
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,450
Kirito: YEAH. (CHUCKLES)

43
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,285
Merchant: ...PICKING A WINNER IS
GONNA BE TOUGHER THAN EVER!

44
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,871
FOR ONLY 1,000 CREDS,
I CAN HOOK YOU UP

45
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,165
WITH TOP‐SECRET INFO
ON ALL THE TOP PLAYERS.

46
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,125
Player: HERE GOES.
ALL ON YAMIKAZE.

47
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,127
Player 2: I WONDER
WHAT HUUKA'S ODDS ARE.

48
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,545
Player 3: COME ON. DYNE?

49
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,797
SURE, HE'S GOT GOOD GEAR
AND SOLID SKILLS,

50
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,049
BUT THAT DUDE'S
OLDER THAN HELL, YOU KNOW.

51
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,759
AT BEST,
HE'D COME IN 15th TODAY.

52
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,596
IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH
A LONG SHOT, GO WITH RICHIE.

53
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,597
HMM?

54
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,098
Dyne: (CHUCKLES)

55
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,350
SO YOU THINK
I'M TOO OLD TO GET IT ON?

56
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,810
Player 3:
NO, I WAS JUST SAYING...

57
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,437
Dyne: THIS OLD DOG'S
GOT SOME NEW TRICKS.

58
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,438
Player 4: HEY, LOOK.

59
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,440
I‐IT'S KIRITO.

60
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,859
Player 5: SHE HACKS UP PEOPLE
GOOD WITH THAT PHOTON SWORD.

61
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,321
Player 6: OH,
A HOT BERSERKER WITH A BLADE.

62
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,364
Player 5:
SINON'S MORE MY TYPE, BROTHER.

63
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,533
Player 4: I WOULDN'T MIND
GETTING A BULLET FROM SINON.

64
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,826
Player 5: ROGER THAT.

65
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,328
Player 6: HEH.
I'D RATHER GET SLASHED.

66
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,580
Player 4: THEN GO PLAY "A. L. O."
WITH THE FAERIES.

67
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,957
Kirito: (GASPS)

68
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,083
OH, SORRY.

69
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,835
Players:
(GASPS) YOU'RE KIRITO!

70
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,878
S‐SORRY!

71
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,591
(GASPS)

72
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,926
(SHUDDERING)

73
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,844
Kirito: HEY, GUYS...

74
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,766
HOPE Y'ALL ROOT FOR ME.

75
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,976
Players: (GASP)

76
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,687
Player 7: Y‐YOU GOT IT.
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

77
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,440
Player 8:
I BET MY LIFE SAVINGS ON YOU.

78
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,691
Kirito: (LAUGHS)

79
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,944
Sinon: OH, GOD.
QUIT MESSING WITH THEM.

80
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,911
Kirito: OKAY. (CLEARS THROAT)

81
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:32,833
SO 30 PLAYERS GET DROPPED
RANDOMLY ACROSS THE SAME MAP,

82
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,209
AND THEN‐‐(GASPS)

83
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,671
AND THEN YOU GO AROUND
SHOOTING WHOEVER YOU FIND,

84
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,631
AND THE WINNER'S
THE LAST ONE STANDING?

85
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,592
Sinon: OH, MAN. KNEW IT.

86
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,927
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME EXPLAIN

87
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,137
THE WHOLE DAMN THING
TO YOU AFTER ALL.

88
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,807
DON'T YOU HAVE E‐MAIL?

89
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,517
THE ADMINS SENT THE RULES OUT,

90
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,477
SO IT SHOULD BE SITTING
IN YOUR IN‐BOX.

91
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,563
Kirito: YEAH, I DID
SCAN THROUGH IT, BUT...

92
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,024
IT'S LIKE I WANTED
TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD.

93
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,694
THERE WAS A LOT OF INFO
TO ABSORB.

94
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,945
Sinon: (SCOFFS) "ABSORB."

95
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,616
BASICALLY YOU PRETTY MUCH
GOT THE GIST OF IT.

96
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,410
THIS THING'S A BATTLE ROYALE

97
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,745
BETWEEN 30 PLAYERS
ON THE SAME MAP.

98
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,415
START POINTS ARE RANDOM,
AND PLAYERS ARE DROPPED

99
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,750
ABOUT 1,000 METERS
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

100
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,002
Kirito: WHOA. 1,000.

101
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,088
THAT'S GOTTA BE
ONE INSANELY HUGE MAP.

102
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,091
Sinon: HONESTLY, YOU DIDN'T
READ THE E‐MAIL, DID YOU?

103
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,718
(SIGHS)

104
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,388
IT'S A MULTISTAGE ARENA
10 KILOMETERS IN DIAMETER.

105
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,765
IT'S GOT MOUNTAINS,
FORESTS, AND DESERTS.

106
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,767
THE START TIME'S AFTERNOON,

107
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,769
SO THERE'S NO ADVANTAGE
OR DISADVANTAGE

108
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,147
IN TERMS OF GEAR OR SKILLS.

109
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,816
Kirito: HOW CAN YOU FIND ANYONE
IN A FIELD THAT BIG?

110
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,318
Sinon:
THAT MAKES IT CHALLENGING.

111
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,403
IT'S A GAME WITH GUNFIGHTS,
REMEMBER?

112
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,865
ANYWAY, PLAYERS GET AN ITEM
TO TRACK OTHER PLAYERS.

113
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,034
IT'S CALLED A SATELLITE
SCAN TERMINAL.

114
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,285
Kirito: THERE'S A SATELLITE?

115
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,120
LIKE A SPY DRONE OR SOMETHING?

116
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,121
Sinon: YEP.

117
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,457
IT WORKS JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE.

118
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,043
IT PASSES OVERHEAD
EVERY 15 MINUTES.

119
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,294
IT SCANS THE ARENA

120
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,754
AND THEN TRANSMITS
THE COORDINATES

121
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,423
OF ALL THE PLAYERS
DIRECTLY TO YOUR TERMINAL.

122
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,591
NEAT, HUH?

123
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,217
Kirito: HMM.

124
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,639
SO BASICALLY YOU CAN ONLY HIDE
IN ONE SPOT FOR 15 MINUTES.

125
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,432
Sinon: YOU CATCH ON QUICK.

126
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,934
Kirito: BUT THEN DOESN'T
ALL THAT MOVING AROUND

127
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,728
PUT A SNIPER
AT A DISADVANTAGE?

128
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,772
Sinon: 15 MINUTES
IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME

129
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,690
FOR A SNIPER TO DO THEIR JOB.

130
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,692
I FIRE. I KILL MY TARGET.

131
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,194
I MOVE ON.

132
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,447
Kirito: UH, YEAH, I GUESS.

133
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,616
Sinon: SO WE GOOD HERE? GREAT.

134
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,117
NEXT TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER...

135
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,494
‐ Kirito: NO! WAIT!
‐ Sinon: YOU CAN BET YOUR ASS‐‐

136
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,120
‐ Kirito: HOLD ON!
‐ (DRINK SPILLS)

137
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,958
Sinon: IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,293
Kirito: UH‐HUH.

139
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,837
IT'S WHAT I REALLY
WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

140
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,509
Sinon: (SIGHS)

141
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,929
MM.

142
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,305
Kirito: HANG ON.

143
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,183
COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS LIST REAL QUICK?

144
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,185
OUT OF ALL
THE B. o. B. CONTESTANTS,

145
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,188
ARE THERE ANY FIRST‐TIMERS
WHOSE NAMES YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE?

146
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,731
Sinon: OKAY, THAT'S WEIRD.

147
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,734
Kirito: PLEASE,
JUST LOOK AT IT, AND TELL ME.

148
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,819
IT'S IMPORTANT.

149
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,281
Sinon: WELL, IF THAT'S
ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW,

150
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,700
I GUESS IT'S COOL.

151
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,662
THE FIRST‐TIMERS I DON'T KNOW,

152
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,456
BESIDES A CERTAIN LOSER
WITH A PHOTON SWORD,

153
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,624
ARE THREE NAMES.

154
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,334
Kirito: THAT'S GREAT. WHO?

155
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,044
POINT 'EM OUT.

156
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,340
Sinon: JUSHI X, PALE RIDER,

157
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,176
AND THIS GUY,

158
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,011
STERBEN?

159
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,266
Kirito: (THINKING)
IS ONE OF THEM DEATH GUN?

160
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,268
Sinon: YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,

161
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,228
OR ARE YOU
GONNA KEEP ME IN THE DARK?

162
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,563
Kirito: UH...

163
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,154
Sinon: GETTING READY
TO BLOW A FUSE OVER HERE.

164
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,447
Kirito: UH...

165
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,990
Sinon: SPEAK UP.

166
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,325
I SWEAR, IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE ME MESS UP TODAY

167
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,618
BY PISSING ME OFF, I'M GONNA...

168
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,663
Kirito: NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

169
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,081
IT'S JUST THAT...

170
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,585
Sinon: DOES IT
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

171
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,754
WITH WHY YOU WERE
ACTING WEIRD YESTERDAY,

172
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,338
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE PRELIMS?

173
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,096
Kirito: UH‐HUH. IT DOES.

174
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,225
YESTERDAY, THIS PERSON
I ONCE PLAYED AGAINST

175
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,811
IN ANOTHER V.R.M.M.O.
CAME UP TO ME.

176
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:26,441
I'M PRETTY SURE ONE OF THE NAMES
YOU POINTED OUT IS HIM.

177
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,568
Sinon: IS HE A FRIEND OF YOURS?

178
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,237
Kirito: NO, AN ENEMY.

179
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,491
I CAN'T REMEMBER
HIS NAME, THOUGH,

180
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,578
AND I THINK WE TRIED
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

181
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,539
Sinon: KILL EACH OTHER?

182
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,083
FOR REAL?

183
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,336
WAS IT LIKE AN ARGUMENT
WITH SOMEONE IN YOUR PARTY,

184
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,504
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

185
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,506
Kirito: NO WAY.
IT WASN'T THAT.

186
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,758
YOU DON'T KILL SOMEONE
OVER AN ARGUMENT.

187
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,095
HIM AND HIS GROUP
DID HORRIBLE THINGS,

188
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,431
THINGS LIKE MURDER.

189
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,350
THEY WERE TOO FAR GONE,

190
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,061
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP THEM WAS BY FORCE.

191
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,231
I DON'T REGRET WHAT I DID,

192
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:11,027
BUT STILL, I'VE AVOIDED
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

193
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,572
I FORCED MYSELF TO FORGET
IT EVEN HAPPENED.

194
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,453
FOR ME,
THERE'S NO MORE RUNNING AWAY,

195
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,165
AND THIS TIME, I HAVE TO FACE
WHAT I DID HEAD‐ON.

196
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,377
SORRY TO EMOTE LIKE THAT.

197
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,087
JUST FORGET IT.

198
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,340
Sinon: DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
STILL PULL THE TRIGGER, THOUGH?

199
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,800
Kirito: (GASPS)

200
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,177
COULD YOU SHOOT A PLAYER IN HERE

201
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:40,640
IF YOU KNEW, IN THE REAL WORLD,
THAT PLAYER WOULD DIE FROM IT?

202
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,351
AND WHAT IF YOU
HAD TO KILL THAT PLAYER,

203
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,646
'CAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T, YOU OR
SOMEONE YOU LOVE WOULD DIE?

204
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,648
IF YOU HAD THAT POWER,

205
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,775
COULD YOU STILL
PULL THAT TRIGGER?

206
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,277
Sinon: KIRITO...

207
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,947
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME
YOU MET THIS GUY IN?

208
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,494
SORRY. NEVER MIND.
THAT'S PERSONAL.

209
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,329
Kirito: NO, THAT'S OKAY.

210
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,669
Sinon: KIRITO...

211
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,338
I...

212
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,676
Kirito: SINON?

213
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,556
Sinon: WE SHOULD START HEADING
OVER TO THE WAITING DOME NOW.

214
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,308
WE HAVE TO CHECK OUR GEAR

215
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,602
AND GET OURSELVES
PSYCHED UP FOR THIS BATTLE.

216
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,061
Kirito: YEAH, SURE.

217
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,354
LEAD THE WAY.

218
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,207
Sinon: I GET YOU'VE GOT
YOUR REASONS FOR BEING HERE,

219
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,541
JUST LIKE ME.

220
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,753
BUT IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO

221
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,463
WITH THAT PROMISE YOU MADE.

222
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,131
I GOTTA PAY YOU BACK

223
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,259
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
IN YESTERDAY'S FINAL. GOT IT?

224
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,222
YOU OWE ME A FIGHT,
SO YOU BETTER STAY ALIVE.

225
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,557
Kirito: ROGER THAT.
I PROMISE I'LL SURVIVE

226
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,935
AND GIVE YOU THE FIGHT YOU WANT.

227
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,896
Sinon: THANKS.

228
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,278

251
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,898
HMM?

252
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,070

00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,513
Sinon: 21 SURVIVORS
LEFT IN PLAY.

256
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,315
LOOKS LIKE DYNE'S ON THE RUN.

257
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,860
RICHIE'S GOT
A HEAVY MACHINE GUN,

258
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,278
SO HE'LL SIT TIGHT.

259
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,948
HE LIKES HIS PREY COMING TO HIM.

260
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,784
I'LL GO AFTER DYNE
AND PALE RIDER.

261
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,539
WONDER HOW HE'S DOING OUT THERE.

262
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,753
AH, WHAT THE HELL DO I CARE?

263
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,524
Dyne: (PANTING)

264
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,945
DAMN. THIS GUY'S
FREAKING PERSISTENT.

265
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,406
EH?

266
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,872
HEH.

267
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,304
COME ON. I GOT A MAG FULL
OF ROUNDS WITH YOUR NAME ON 'EM.

268
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,936
Sinon: YOU FORGOT
TO CHECK YOUR SIX AGAIN, DYNE.

269
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,062
SEE YOU LATER.

270
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,899
(GASPS)

271
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,983
WHO'S THERE?

272
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,904
Kirito: SHH.

273
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:29,864
KEEP IT DOWN.

274
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,115
I NEED A FAVOR.

275
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,325
Sinon: ARE YOU KIDDING?

276
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,993
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR ANY MORE FAVORS.

277
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,913
ONE OF US DIES RIGHT NOW.

278
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,414
Kirito: STOP IT.

279
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,374
I DON'T WANT THOSE GUYS
TO KNOW WE'RE HERE.

280
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,876
Sinon: WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

281
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,670
Kirito: I WANT TO WATCH
WHAT HAPPENS ON THAT BRIDGE,

282
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,881
SO DON'T SHOOT, OKAY?

283
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,508
Sinon: OKAY. THEN WHAT?

284
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,635
Kirito: THAT DEPENDS,

285
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,637
BUT I'M NOT HERE FOR YOU.

286
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,722
I'LL LEAVE AFTER, PROMISE.

287
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,599
Sinon: THE MINUTE
YOU TURN YOUR BACK,

288
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,683
I'LL BLOW YOU AWAY.

289
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,393
Kirito: IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

290
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,188
THEN FINE, BUT FOR NOW,
JUST STAY QUIET.

291
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,857
Sinon: ALL RIGHT,

292
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,026
BUT AFTER THEY'RE DONE
DOWN THERE, IT'S YOU AND ME.

293
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,069
Kirito: OKAY.

294
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,499
Sinon: YOUR STEALTH SKILLS
ARE PRETTY PATHETIC.

295
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,340
I'M NOT LETTING HIM
LEAVE THE AREA ALIVE.

296
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,051
IF HE MAKES A MOVE,
I'M TAKING THE SHOT.

297
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,386
Kirito: HE'S ALL YOURS.

298
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,971
WAIT. COMPANY.

299
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,951
Dyne: EH? SON OF A...

300
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,578
(CHUCKLES)

301
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,961
DAMN.

302
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,091
Sinon: WHOA. HE'S FAST.

303
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,552
HE BOOSTED
HIS THREE‐DIMENSIONAL MOBILITY

304
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,637
BY CARRYING LIGHTER GEAR.

305
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,144
HIS ACROBATIC SKILLS
ARE THROUGH THE ROOF.

306
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,318
Dyne: BASTARD.

307
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,113
(GROANS)

308
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,532
(GUNSHOT)

309
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,080
NO.

310
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,226
Sinon: IF ONLY HE HAD TIME
TO SWITCH MAGS,

311
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,229
HE COULD HAVE SHOT FROM THE HIP
AND KILLED HIM EASY.

312
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,190
Kirito: THAT PALE GUY,

313
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,652
HE'S QUICK AND POWERFUL.

314
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,987
MAYBE HE'S THE ONE
IN THE CLOAK.

315
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:20,117
AN ENEMY. I THINK WE TRIED
TO KILL EACH OTHER ONCE BEFORE.

316
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,581
Sinon: I'M TAKING HIM OUT.

317
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,041
Kirito: OKAY,

318
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,336
BUT IT WON'T BE EASY
IF HE'S WHO I THINK.

319
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,671
Sinon: OH, PLEASE.

320
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,340
HE CAN'T DODGE MY BULLET
AT THIS RANGE.

321
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,176
Both: (GASP)

322
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,136
(RIVER RUSHING)

323
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:47,841
Sinon: DID YOU HEAR A GUNSHOT?

324
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:49,843
Kirito: THERE WASN'T ONE.

325
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:51,887
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

326
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:53,388
Sinon: TWO POSSIBILITIES.

327
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,516
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LASER RIFLE
WITH A MUFFLED BLAST

328
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,311
OR MAYBE A LIVE‐AMMO GUN
WITH A SILENCER.

329
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:02,481
EITHER WAY,
IT WASN'T A KILL SHOT,

330
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:04,316
SO WHY ISN'T HE MOVING?

331
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:07,319
Kirito: I THINK THE SHOT
CAME FROM THE FOREST.

332
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,447
Sinon: UH‐UH. HE WAS SNIPED
FROM FURTHER AWAY THAN THAT.

333
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:13,533
I DID A SCAN OF THE MAP
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

334
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:15,994
THERE'S NO ONE
WITHIN ONE KILOMETER OF HERE.

335
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:17,996
AND NOW THAT WE'RE
ON THE SUBJECT,

336
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:20,290
YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHERE YOU CAME FROM?

337
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:23,627
Kirito: UH, I WAS CHASING
AFTER THAT PALE RIDER GUY.

338
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:25,128
HANG ON.

339
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,254
OH, NO WAY.

340
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:27,672
Sinon: WHAT'S UP?

341
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:29,591
Kirito: WHEN THE SATELLITE
WAS SCANNING THE AREA,

342
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,093
I WAS SWIMMING IN THAT RIVER.

343
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:33,595
I GUESS MY LOCATION
DIDN'T REGISTER ON THE MAP

344
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:35,055
'CAUSE I WAS UNDERWATER.

345
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:37,265
Sinon: WITH ALL THAT GEAR,
YOU SHOULD HAVE DROWNED.

346
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:39,851
Kirito: NAH. I TOOK IT ALL OFF
BEFORE I DOVE IN,

347
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:41,228
STUCK IT IN MY ITEM STORAGE.

348
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:42,687
Sinon: (SIGHS)

349
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:45,398
I NEVER KNEW
WE COULD USE THE RIVER

350
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,067
FOR COVER FROM THE SATELLITE.

351
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:48,401
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

352
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:50,070
I'LL KEEP IT IN MIND.

353
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:53,532
Kirito: SINON,
CHECK OUT HIS SHOULDER.

354
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:55,575
THERE'S A WEIRD LIGHT THERE.

355
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,038
Sinon: A STUN BULLET.

356
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,917
Kirito: (GASPS)

357
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:17,264
HOW LONG'S HE BEEN THERE?

358
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:28,441
Sinon: HE'S GOT
A SILENT ASSASSIN.

359
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:30,569
Kirito: IS THAT
WHAT HIS RIFLE'S CALLED?

360
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,696
Sinon: YEAH.
IT'S A HIGH‐END SNIPER RIFLE

361
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:35,031
THAT'S GOT
A BAD‐ASS SILENCER ON IT.

362
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:38,660
I HEARD RUMORS
ABOUT THERE BEING ONE IN "GGO,"

363
00:21:38,702 --> 00:21:41,705
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.

364
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:43,707
IF HE CAN HANDLE THAT GUN,

365
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:46,668
HE MUST BE SOME PLAYER.

366
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:02,058
Kirito: (GASPS)

367
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,768
Sinon: WHY WOULD HE
USE HIS HANDGUN

368
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,811
TO FINISH HIM OFF?

369
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:09,065
Kirito: SINON, SHOOT.

370
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:10,400
Sinon: HUH? WHICH ONE?

371
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:12,152
Kirito: IT'S THE GUY
IN THE CLOAK.

372
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:13,820
THERE'S NO TIME! SHOOT HIM!

373
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:15,280
HURRY!

374
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:17,115
DON'T LET HIM FIRE THAT GUN!
