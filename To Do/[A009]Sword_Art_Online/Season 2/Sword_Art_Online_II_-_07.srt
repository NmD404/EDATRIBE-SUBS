00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,396
Leafa: WELL...

5
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,440
THIS MORNING,
I JUST SO HAPPENED

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,150
TO SEE AN INTERESTING ARTICLE.

7
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,946

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,614
Kirito: OH. ( CHUCKLES )

9
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,241
WOW, WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,867
SOMEONE'S GOT
A SIMILAR HANDLE.

11
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,994
Leafa: YEAH, EXCEPT
THIS ISN'T SIMILAR.

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,329
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,122
Kirito: IF YOU'RE GONNA
PUT IT THAT WAY,

14
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,582
THEN, YEAH, I GUESS.

15
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,961
ALTHOUGH THAT NAME'S
NOT REALLY THAT UNUSUAL.

16
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,171
I MEAN, MINE'S AN ABBREVIATION.

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,675
MAYBE THE KIRITO
IN GGO's NAME IS KIRI‐‐

Kirito: WHO IS HE?

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,252
HE'S GOTTA BE ONE
OF THE SURVIVORS FROM "S. A. O."

24

AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

25
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,674
WE MUST HAVE FOUGHT
AT SOME POINT,

26
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,760

COME ON.

35
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,408
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
I WOULDN'T NOTICE

36
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,576
WHEN YOU SUDDENLY VANISHED
FROM MY FRIEND LIST?

37
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,869
Kirito: I DIDN'T THINK

38
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,663
YOU CHECKED THAT THING
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

39
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,790
Leafa: I DON'T. I JUST KNEW.

40
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,960
LAST NIGHT,
I GOT THIS WEIRD FEELING

41
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,169
AND CHECKED MY LIST.

42
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,879
WHEN I SAW YOU WEREN'T ON IT,

43
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,383
I HEADED OVER TO YOUR ROOM AND
WAS ABOUT TO BUST THE DOOR DOWN.

44
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,261
I DIDN'T, 'CAUSE I KNEW IT'D
PISS YOU OFF SOMETHING FIERCE.

45
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,472
I ALSO KNEW YOU'D NEVER QUIT
"A. L. O." WITHOUT TELLING ME.

46
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,683
I FIGURED YOU MUST HAVE
A GOOD REASON,

47
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,769
SO I CALLED ASUNA UP
TO SEE IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING.

48
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,438
Kirito: YOU DID?

49
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,106

JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW...

OVERLOADING YOU, I COULD HELP.

69
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,941
Kirito: THANKS FOR OFFERING.

70
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,985
I GOT IT, THOUGH.

71

DRAG ASUNA INTO THIS.

AS I'VE KNOWN YOU,

CALM, AND LEVELHEADED.

YOU'VE GOT THE SAME PROBLEMS
AT SCHOOL AS ME,

187
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,518
BUT YOU DIDN'T RUN AWAY
LIKE I DID.

188
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,604
YOU'RE, LIKE, REALLY STRONG.

NOT STRONG AT ALL.

190

YOU'LL BE LIKE THAT
IN REAL LIFE, TOO.

GO BALLISTIC OVER THAT GUY,

198
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,713

I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

Kirito: DO YOU EVER WISH

257
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,198
YOU COULD JUST FORGET
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE?

258
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,701

259
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,913
NOT SURE IF THIS IS AN ANSWER,
BUT IT'S THE BEST I GOT.

260
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,250
I GUESS I THINK IF SOMETHING'S
MEANT TO BE FORGOTTEN,

261
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,627
A PERSON'LL END UP FORGETTING IT

262
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,422
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING
THEY WANT TO.

263

264
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,926
THE MORE A PERSON WISHES
THEY COULD FORGET SOMETHING,

265
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,803
THE STRONGER THE MEMORY BECOMES,

266
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,139
TILL THEY CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

267
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,057
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,

268
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,144
THEN MAYBE SUBCONSCIOUSLY,
WHATEVER THE MEMORY IS,

269
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,563
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT SHOULDN'T BE FORGOTTEN.

270

Kirito: THEN IF I FORGOT,

271
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,193
I MUST BE A MONSTER.

272
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,865
WHEN I WAS STUCK IN "S. A. O.,"

273
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,033
I TOOK OUT‐‐

274
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,244
NO, I KILLED THREE PEOPLE.

275
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,122
THEY WERE ALL RED PLAYERS,

276
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,249
SO MURDER WAS THEIR BUSINESS,

277
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,209
AND I COULD HAVE
OVERPOWERED THEM

278
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,128
INSTEAD OF KILLING THEM, BUT...

279
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,256
I WENT AHEAD
AND KILLED THEM ANYWAY.

280
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,093
I DID IT OUT OF RAGE,
HATRED, REVENGE.

281
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,472
AND OVER THE PAST YEAR,

282
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,183
I'VE TOTALLY FORGOTTEN
ALL ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE.

283
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,518
EVEN AS I SIT HERE
TALKING ABOUT IT,

284
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,521
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT TWO OF 'EM LOOKED LIKE

285
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,190
OR WHAT THEIR NAMES WERE.

286
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,441
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

287
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,902
IF I CAN FORGET PEOPLE I KILLED,

288
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,072
WHAT'S THAT SAY
ABOUT ME AS A PERSON?

289
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,788
Aki: I'M SORRY, KIRIGAYA.

290
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,249
I GUESS I'M NOT THE AWESOME
COUNSELOR I THOUGHT I WAS.

291
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,461
I WISH I COULD TAKE AWAY
THE BURDEN YOU'RE CARRYING

292
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,422
OR AT LEAST HELP
SHARE THE LOAD OF IT.

293
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,258
WHAT DO I KNOW?

294
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,803
I'VE NEVER EVEN PLAYED
"SWORD ART ONLINE."

295
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,722
WHEN YOU SAY YOU KILLED SOMEONE,

296
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,974
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

297
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,976
BUT THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW.

298
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,520
WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE,

299
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,730
THE REASON YOU DID WHAT YOU DID

300
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,817
WAS TO SAVE SOMEONE ELSE,
WASN'T IT?

301
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,735
IN THE MEDICAL FIELD,

302
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,571
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO CHOOSE
WHO TO SAVE.

303
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,242
IT DOESN'T MAKE THE DECISION
TO LET SOMEONE DIE ANY EASIER,

304
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,994
BUT STILL,
IN A LIFE‐OR‐DEATH SITUATION,

305
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,454
EVERYONE'S GOT THE RIGHT

306
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,790
TO CONSIDER THE PEOPLE
THEY CAN SAVE

307
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,000
OVER THOSE THEY CAN'T,

308
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,544
EVEN YOU.

309
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,839
JUST THINK ABOUT THE LIVES
OF ALL THE PEOPLE YOU SAVED,

310
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,007
AND YOU'LL MAKE PEACE
WITH YOUR DECISION.

311
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,176
Kirito: I DON'T KNOW.

312
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,971
I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU, BUT...

313
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,557
I CAN'T. I KILLED PEOPLE.

314
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,476
I KILLED 'EM, AND I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHO THEY WERE!

315
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,145
DON'T YOU GET IT?

316
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,564
IT'S LIKE I DON'T EVEN CARE
THAT THEY'RE DEAD.

317
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,941

TO FIND ANY PEACE!

ABOUT WHAT YOU DID,

WHEN IT DOES‐‐AND IT WILL‐‐

325
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,720
JUST MAKE SURE YOU REMEMBER

WHO ARE ALIVE TODAY

327
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,183
