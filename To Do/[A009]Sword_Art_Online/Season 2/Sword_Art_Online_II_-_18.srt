WHAT I WAS FIGHTING FOR.

00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,431
I'M HOME.

175
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,981
Leafa: OH, MY GOD, SERIOUSLY?

176
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,316
HEY, ASUNA, WAKE UP!

177
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,650
Asuna: HUH?

178
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,277
Leafa: (SIGHS)
THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO.

179
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,278
Lisbeth: HUH?

180
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,530
(SIGHS)

181
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,407
GOD, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT.

182
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,951
IT'S LIKE HE'S DARING US
TO STAY AWAKE.

183
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,245
Asuna: (LAUGHS)
I'LL MAKE SOME MORE TEA,

184
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,164
AND IT'LL WAKE US RIGHT UP.

185
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,042
Silica: HEY, LOOK.

186
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,169
I GUESS IT STOPPED SNOWING
WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING.

187
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,754
Leafa: YEAH.
IT REALLY CAME DOWN.

188
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,547
Lisbeth: OH,
HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS?

189
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,548
Asuna: WHAT?

190
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,133
Lisbeth: YOU KNOW, ABOUT ZEKKEN?

191
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,052
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.

192
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,221
Asuna: ZEK‐KEN?

193
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,644
Asuna: ZEKKEN? IS THAT SOME KIND

194
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,312
OF RARE ITEM OR SOMETHING?

195
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,313
Lisbeth: ERRH! WRONG.

196
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,232
IT'S THE NAME OF A PLAYER.

197
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,858
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT THEIR HANDLE.

198
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,610
IT'S MORE LIKE A NICKNAME.

199
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,529
ANYWAY, THIS PLAYER'S SO BADASS,
SOMEONE CALLED THEM ZEKKEN.

200
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,115
THE NAME CAUGHT ON,
AND THERE YOU GO.

201
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,076
IT MEANS "ABSOLUTE SWORD."

202
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,869
ULTIMATE SWORD'S BETTER, THOUGH.

203
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,871
EITHER WAY, THIS PLAYER'S TOUGH.

204
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,873
Asuna: REALLY?

205
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,837
SO, UH, WHEN DID YOU FIRST HEAR
ABOUT THIS ZEKKEN PERSON?

206
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,674
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS MAYBE THE FIRST TIME

207
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,634
WAS AROUND NEW YEAR'S
OR SOMETHING,

208
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,636
MAYBE A WEEK OR SO AGO.

209
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,971
OH, DUH. THAT EXPLAINS

210
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,556
WHY YOU'RE
SO OUT OF THE LOOP ABOUT IT.

211
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,016
YOU'VE BEEN
AT YOUR FAMILY'S COMPOUND

212
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,309
IN KYOTO THIS WHOLE TIME.

213
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,478
Asuna: (GROANS)
I WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME,

214
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,563
BUT YOU HAD TO BRING THAT UP.

215
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,525
Lisbeth: LISTEN TO THE RICH GIRL
REBELING AGAINST HER CUSHY LIFE.

216
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,734
SOUNDS LIKE A DRAG.

217
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,611
Asuna: A DRAG
IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.

218
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,280
I HAD TO SIT ON MY KNEES

219
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,073
IN A KIMONO ALL DAY
GREETING PEOPLE.

220
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,992
I BROUGHT MY AMUSPHERE ALONG,

221
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,829
THINKING I COULD DIVE AT NIGHT
WHILE EVERYONE WAS ASLEEP,

222
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,247
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

223
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,916
THE GUESTHOUSE I WAS IN
DIDN'T HAVE WI‐FI.

224
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,334
FUN, RIGHT?

225
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,295
IT WASN'T.

226
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,342
‐ (MUSIC PLAYING)
‐ (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE )

227
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,783
Lisbeth: ASUNA.

228
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,203
ASUNA.

229
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,664
YOU EVEN LISTENING? HELLO.

230
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,374
Asuna: HUH? S‐SORRY.

231
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,001
I JUST REMEMBERED
SOMETHING LAME.

232
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,170
Lisbeth: I WONDER
WHAT THAT COULD BE.

233
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,630
WERE YOUR FOLKS TRYING
TO HOOK YOU UP WITH SOMEONE?

234
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,175
Asuna: N‐NO, NOT AT ALL!
FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

235
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,176
Lisbeth: (LAUGHS)

236
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,761
OKAY, OKAY. JUST KIDDING.

237
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,430
Asuna: SO, ANYWAY,
IS THIS TOUGH NEW PLAYER

238
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,848
A PK‐er OR SOMETHING?

239
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,059
Lisbeth: MM‐MM.
JUST A DUELIST. THAT'S ALL.

240
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,810
Asuna: WERE THEY
IN ANY TOURNAMENTS?

241
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,771
Lisbeth: NOPE.
AS FAR AS I KNOW,

242
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,065
THIS PLAYER'S A TOTAL NOOB.
I HAVE A FEELING

243
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,984
THEY MIGHT HAVE CONVERTED OVER
FROM ANOTHER GAME, THOUGH.

244
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,903
YOU SHOULD SEE
THEIR SKILL STATS.

245
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,987
THEY'RE THROUGH THE ROOF.

246
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,156
YOU KNOW HOW, ON FLOOR 24,

247
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,576
THERE'S THAT TINY, LITTLE ISLAND
JUST NORTH OF THE MAIN TOWN,

248
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,328
THE ONE WITH THE HUGE TREE?

249
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,205
WELL, EVERY DAY AT 3:00,

250
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,874
YOU KNOW WHO SHOWS UP
UNDER THAT TREE

251
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,877
WAITING TO TAKE ON
ANY CHALLENGER ONE‐ON‐ONE.

252
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,300
ZEKKEN STARTED BY POSTING
THIS OPPONENTS WANTED NOTICE

253
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,803
ON THE MMO TOMORROW
BULLETIN BOARD.

254
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,931
FOLKS WANTED TO TEACH THIS
COCKY "A. L. O." NOOB A LESSON,

255
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,975
SO ON THE FIRST DAY,
ABOUT 30 PLAYERS SHOWED UP.

256
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,394
IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL
FOR 'EM, THOUGH.

257
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,271
Asuna: WHAT? THEY LOST?

258
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,774
Lisbeth: ALL OF 'EM,
ONE AFTER THE OTHER.

259
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,818
AND GET THIS.
NONE OF 'EM MANAGED

260
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,695
TO CHIP OFF MORE THAN 30%
OF ZEKKEN'S H. P.

261
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,280
THAT'S A BADASS.

262
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,367
Silica: I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW GOOD ZEKKEN IS.

263
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,329
WHO THOUGHT A NEWBIE TO THE GAME
COULD FLY AS GOOD AS THAT?

264
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,789
IT TOOK ME AT LEAST SIX MONTHS

265
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,041
TO LEARN HOW TO FLY
AND FIGHT AT THE SAME TIME,

266
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,418
AND I'M STILL LEARNING STUFF.

267
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,504
I‐‐I DID IT.

268
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,880
WHAAH!

269
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,133
Asuna: DID YOU
FIGHT ZEKKEN, TOO?

270
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,094
Silica: NOT EVEN. I'M NO DUMMY.

271
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,013
I WATCHED ONE DUEL, AND I KNEW
I DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

272
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,182
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE,

273
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,892
WHY DON'T YOU ASK LIZ AND LEAFA?

274
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,227
THEY TOOK ZEKKEN ON YESTERDAY.

275
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,771
THEY FOUGHT AND LOST
LIKE A COUPLE OF CHAMPS.

276
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,022
Lisbeth: PLEASE DON'T REMIND ME.

277
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,774
Leafa: GOOD LEARNING EXPERIENCE,
THOUGH.

278
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,609
Asuna: (LAUGHS)

279
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,528
AH. IT'S SNOWING.

280
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,614
Silica: YEAH. PRETTY, ISN'T IT?

281
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,785
Asuna: SO, ANYWAY,
BACK TO ZEKKEN.

282
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,454
IF THIS PLAYER'S
AS STRONG AS YOU SAY,

283
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,165
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

284
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,250
BEFORE THERE ARE
NO MORE CHALLENGERS TO FACE.

285
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,002
Silica: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

286
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,421
THERE'S A PRETTY COOL PRIZE
ON THE LINE, DON'T YOU KNOW?

287
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,256
Asuna: REALLY? WHAT IS IT,

288
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,592
SOME KIND OF RARE ITEM
OR SOMETHING?

289
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,468
Silica: NOPE.
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

290
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,388
WHOEVER BEATS ZEKKEN WILL GET
AN ORIGINAL SWORD SKILL.

291
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,184
IT'S A SPECIAL MOVE THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE SUPER STRONG.

292
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,561
Asuna: AN ORIGINAL SWORD SKILL?

293
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,854
HUH.

294
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,023
WHAT TYPE? HOW MANY HITS?

295
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,108
Silica: MM...

296
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,278
WELL, IT'S A GENERAL SKILL
FOR A ONE‐HANDED SWORD.

297
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,946
OH, BUT HERE'S THE THING.

298
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,198
IT'S AN 11‐HIT COMBO!

299
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,158
Asuna: NO WAY! 11?!

300
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,202
Lisbeth: THE STRONGEST
ORIGINAL SWORD SKILL

301
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,121
BEING USED RIGHT NOW,
HOW MANY HITS DOES IT HAVE?

302
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,624
Leafa: THAT'D BE THE ONE
GENERAL EUGENE DEVELOPED,

303
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,958
THE VOLCANIC BLAZER.

304
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,044
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
AN EIGHT‐HIT COMBO.

305
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,713
HE HASN'T PASSED IT ON
TO ANYONE ELSE YET,

306
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,506
AND I DOUBT HE EVER WILL.

307
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,009
Asuna: I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS
WHY SO MANY PLAYERS

308
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,677
KEEP LINING UP
TO CHALLENGE ZEKKEN.

309
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,305
HAVE ANY OF YOU SEEN
THIS SWORD SKILL IN ACTION?

310
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,974
Lisbeth: MM‐MM.
I HEARD ZEKKEN DEMOED IT

311
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,310
ON THE FIRST DAY
OF THE DUELS, THOUGH.

312
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,521
APPARENTLY IT BLEW MINDS
LEFT AND RIGHT,

313
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,025
BUT SINCE THEN, IT HASN'T
BEEN USED IN ANY OF THE FIGHTS.

314
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,986
MAYBE THE REASON FOR THAT'S
'CAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN

315
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,948
ANYONE TOUGH ENOUGH
TO GET ZEKKEN TO USE IT.

316
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,075
WHOEVER DOES HAS MY RESPECT.

317
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,535
Asuna: LEAFA,

318
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,579
WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU FOUGHT ZEKKEN?

319
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,041
Leafa: BESIDES LOSING?
IT WAS GOING GOOD

320
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,044
TILL OUR H.P.s
DROPPED BELOW 60%, BUT...

321
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,757
IN THE END, ZEKKEN BEAT ME

322
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,009
USING NOTHING
BUT DEFAULT SKILLS.

323
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,678
Asuna: REALLY?

324
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,639
OH! I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ALMOST FORGOT TO ASK.

325
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,975
WHAT'S ZEKKEN'S RACE
AND WEAPON OF CHOICE?

326
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,268
Leafa: AN IMP.

327
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,436
THE MAIN WEAPON'S
A ONE‐HANDED SWORD.

328
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,729
IT'S ABOUT AS SKINNY

329
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,940
AS YOUR RAPIER, ASUNA,
BUT ONLY JUST.

330
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,234
AND ZEKKEN'S SUPER FAST, TOO.

331
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,237
I COULDN'T EVEN SEE
THE ATTACKS COMING AT ME.

332
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,239
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED
TO ME BEFORE.

333
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,907
I'M STILL KIND OF SHOCKED.

334
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,576
Asuna: A SPEED TYPE, HUH?

335
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,245
IF YOU HAD A HARD TIME
TRACKING ZEKKEN,

336
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,372
I DOUBT I'D BE ABLE TO, EITHER.

337
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,250
AH! I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO MIGHT, THOUGH.

338
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,961
MR. SLEEPYHEAD'S
THE FASTEST PLAYER I'VE SEEN.

339
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,629
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

340
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,173
WOULD KIRITO
GO FOR THAT KIND OF CHALLENGE?

341
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,175
Lisbeth and Silica: (LAUGH)

342
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,258
Asuna: WHAT? WHAT'D I SAY?

343
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,052
Leafa: (LAUGHS) NOTHING.

344
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,054
IT'S JUST KAZUTO
ALREADY TRIED IT,

345
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,556
AND, BOY, DID HE
LOSE SPECTACULARLY.

346
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:24,475
All: (LAUGH)

347
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,310
Asuna: I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

348
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:27,645
WAS HE HOLDING BACK?

349
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:28,771
Lisbeth: HMM.

350
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:31,107
KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO SAY.

351
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:33,526
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING,
IT LOOKED LIKE IT.

352
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,153
YEAH, BUT THEN I DON'T THINK
I'M REALLY THE BEST PERSON

353
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:37,863
TO JUDGE
WHETHER HE WAS OR WASN'T.

354
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:40,199
HE DIDN'T USE
THAT DUAL‐WIELDING TRICK.

355
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:41,701
THAT'S FOR SURE.

356
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:45,371
SO I GUESS, IN A WAY,
HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT.

357
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,956
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

358
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:49,125
THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE.

359
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,253
I MEAN, IT'S A DUEL
IN A NORMAL GAME.

360
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:54,588
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR KIRITO TO FIGHT

361
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,841
LIKE HIS LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT ANYMORE.

362
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,343
THE ONLY TIME HE'LL TAKE
A FIGHT SERIOUSLY NOW

363
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:02,555
IS IF THE GAME
STOPS BEING A GAME,

364
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:05,307
WHEN THE VIRTUAL WORLD
BECOMES THE REAL WORLD.

365
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:08,352
IN A WAY, I HOPE
HE NEVER GOES FULL TILT

366
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:09,895
IN A BATTLE EVER AGAIN.

367
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:11,772
HE'S KIND OF HAD ENOUGH OF THAT.

368
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:14,442
I MEAN, HECK,
HE GETS INTO ENOUGH TROUBLE

369
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:16,527
ON HIS OWN AS IT IS.

370
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,571
Asuna: HEH.

371
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,322
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

372
00:19:21,532 --> 00:19:23,576
Leafa: WELL,
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING,

373
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:25,244
I GOT A DIFFERENT IMPRESSION.

374
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:28,247
I THINK KAZUTO WAS
DEFINITELY GIVING IT HIS ALL.

375
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,791
HE SEEMED SERIOUS
AND FOCUSED AND DETERMINED.

376
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,793
HE PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT.

377
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:35,171
AT ONE POINT, THOUGH,
SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENED.

378
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:38,215
RIGHT BEFORE THE DUEL WAS OVER,

379
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:39,550
THEY WERE LOCKING SWORDS,

380
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:43,095
AND THEN THEY BOTH JUST STOPPED.

381
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:46,557
IT LOOKED LIKE KAZUTO
WAS SAYING SOMETHING TO ZEKKEN.

382
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:49,018
I COULDN'T HEAR WHAT
'CAUSE OF ALL THE CHEERING.

383
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,895
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

384
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:52,480
THEY BACKED OFF FROM EACH OTHER.

385
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:54,857
ZEKKEN CHARGED HIM.

386
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:56,901
BUT KAZUTO COULDN'T DODGE IT,

387
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:58,319
AND THAT'S HOW THE DUEL ENDED.

388
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,987
Asuna: REALLY?

389
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:01,697
WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

390
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:03,115
Leafa: I WISH I KNEW.

391
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:05,075
I ASKED HIM,
BUT KAZUTO WOULDN'T TELL ME.

392
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:06,494
WHATEVER IT WAS,

393
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:08,662
IT MUST BE PRETTY IMPORTANT
TO KEEP TO HIMSELF.

394
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:10,706
Asuna: INTERESTING.

395
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:11,999
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

396
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,627
I GUESS THE ONLY WAY
TO FIND OUT WHAT HE SAID

397
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:16,212
IS TO ASK ZEKKEN MYSELF.

398
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:19,048
Lisbeth: HUH. YOU THINK
YOU'RE UP TO THE CHALLENGE?

399
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,759
Asuna: I'M NOT DOING IT
'CAUSE I THINK I CAN WIN.

400
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:24,637
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ZEKKEN
PERSON INTRIGUES ME, IS ALL.

401
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:28,307
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I THINK
THIS ZEKKEN PERSON'S HERE

402
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:29,975
FOR REASONS OTHER THAN DUELING.

403
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:31,727
Lisbeth: YEP,
THAT'S WHAT I THINK, TOO.

404
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,480
BUT IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS, GET READY,

405
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:36,023
'CAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO PUT UP

406
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:38,442
AS GOOD A FIGHT AS YOUR BOY
KIRITO AND THEN SOME.

407
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,903
Asuna: (LAUGHS)
YEAH, I KNOW.

408
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:42,905
WILL YOU GUYS COME CHEER ME ON?

409
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:44,865
‐ All: MM‐HMM.
‐ Silica: YOU KNOW WE WILL.

410
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:47,368
IT'LL BE AWESOME. WE WOULDN'T
MISS IT FOR ANYTHING.

411
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:49,745
Lisbeth: WHICH CHARACTER
ARE YOU GONNA DUEL WITH?

412
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:52,248
YOU STILL HAVE
THE SYLPH ACCOUNT, DON'T YA?

413
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,875
Asuna: HMM.
I GUESS I'LL USE THIS ONE.

414
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:57,878
IF ZEKKEN'S A SPEED TYPE,
IT'LL PROBABLY COME DOWN

415
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,798
TO WHO CAN HOLD OUT THE LONGEST,
RATHER THAN D. P. S.

416
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,383
AND THAT'S THAT.

417
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:05,386
SO 3:00 ON THE ISLAND
ON FLOOR 24, RIGHT?

418
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:06,929
Leafa: MM‐HMM.

419
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:10,224
Asuna: THEN IF WE MEET HERE
TOMORROW AT 2:30, WE CAN‐‐

420
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:13,394
OH, NO. IT'S ALREADY 6:00?
I'LL BE LATE FOR DINNER.

421
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:17,314
Leafa: I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL
CALL IT A DAY AND LOG OUT, TOO.

422
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:19,859
Lisbeth: RICH GIRLS
AND THEIR PROBLEMS. AM I RIGHT?

423
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,237
Silica: (GIGGLES) I CAN'T
BELIEVE HE'S STILL ASLEEP.

424
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,739
Leafa: I KNOW.
HE DIDN'T EVEN FEEL A THING.

425
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:27,741
‐ Asuna: HEY, LIZ.
‐ Lisbeth: WHAT'S UP?

426
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:29,493
Asuna: A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

427
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:32,037
YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT ZEKKEN
CONVERTED OVER TO "A. L. O."

428
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,457
THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED THE DUELS
GOT ME THINKING.

429
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:38,961
COULD ZEKKEN BE
SOMEONE FROM "S. A. O."?

430
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:45,467
Lisbeth: UH‐HUH.

431
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:48,012
THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GOT
AFTER MY DUEL.

432
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:50,097
I WANTED A SECOND OPINION,

433
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:53,976
SO AFTER KIRITO LOST HIS,
I ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT.

434
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:56,937
Asuna: SO WHAT DID
KIRITO HAVE TO SAY?

435
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:59,356
Lisbeth: HE SAID
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE SKILLS

436
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:01,567
WERE THROUGH THE ROOF,
ZEKKEN'S DEFINITELY NOT

437
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:03,903
A PLAYER FROM "S. A. O."
THAT'S NOT ALL.

438
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:07,698
KIRITO ALSO SAID THAT IF ZEKKEN
REALLY WAS FROM "S. A. O.,"

439
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,326
THE DUAL‐WIELDING SKILL
WOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO HIM.

440
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:13,245
IT WOULD HAVE GONE TO ZEKKEN.

441
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:14,330
Asuna: (GASPS)
