Girl: ASADA!

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,491
SHINO ASADA!

4
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,382
Shopgirl: ALL YOUR FAVORITES
ARE IN STOCK RIGHT NOW.

5
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,344
Girl 2: MOVE.

6
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,263
GO ON.
QUIT DRAGGIN' YOUR FEET!

7
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,557
Endo: I NEED A FAVOR.

8
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,643
WE SORTA WENT
OVER‐TIME AT KARAOKE,

9
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,145
AND NOW WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH CASH FOR THE TRAIN HOME.

10
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,813
WE'RE GONNA NEED ABOUT TEN.

11
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,981
WE'LL PAY YOU BACK, THOUGH.

12
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,524
Sinon: TEN THOUSAND?

13
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,860
I DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH MONEY ON ME.

14
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,572
Endo: WELL,
GO WITHDRAW IT THEN.

15
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,618
Sinon: NO.

16
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,661
Endo: HUH?

17
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,538
Sinon: YOU HEARD. I SAID NO.

18
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,625
I'M NOT GIVING YOU GUYS
ANY MONEY.

19
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,543
Endo: YOU BITCH.

20
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,213
WE'LL DO THIS THE HARD WAY.

21
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,757
Sinon: GET OUT OF THE WAY.
I WANNA GO.

22
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,925

00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,265

26
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:22,119
(CHUCKLES) POOR ASADA.

27
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,870
Y'KNOW MY BIG BROTHER?

28
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,498
WELL, HE'S GOT A BUTT‐LOAD
OF THESE MODEL GUNS.

29
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,126
WOULDN'T IT BE COOL
IF I BROUGHT SOME TO CLASS?

30
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,253
I KNOW YOU LIKE GUNS,

31
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,713
ESPECIALLY PISTOLS.

32
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,386
Girl 2: UH‐OH.
SOMEONE'S GONNA HURL.

33
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:43,056
Girl 1: REMEMBER WHEN YOU BLEW
CHUNKS IN CLASS AND FAINTED?

34
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,143
OH, GOD, THAT STANK
LIKE ASS FOR DAYS.

35
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,395
Endo: ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS GIVE US YOUR MONEY,

36
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,813
AND WE'LL LET YOU GO HOME.

37
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,607
DON'T YA WANNA?
I MEAN, YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.

38
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,485
Kyoji: OFFICER!

39
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,947
A GIRL'S GETTING MUGGED
IN THE ALLEY! HURRY!

40
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,242
Endo: BITCH!

41
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
Sinon: (PANTING)

42
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,420
Kyoji: ASADA.

43
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,838
ARE YOU OKAY?

44
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,763
Sinon: YEAH,
I'M FINE, SHINKAWA.

45
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,556
THANKS FOR THAT.

46
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,273
Kyoji: SO I HEARD
WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY.

47
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,192
YOU WENT ON QUITE THE RAMPAGE.

48
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,111
Sinon: YEAH, BUT FOR
A STRATEGY, IT WAS A FAIL.

49
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,280
I MEAN,
WE STARTED THE OP WITH SIX

50
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,324
AND LOST FOUR
BY THE END OF IT.

51
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,826
IF THAT'S THE OUTCOME
OF AN AMBUSH WE SET UP,

52
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,661
IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A WIN, Y'KNOW?

53
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,413
Kyoji: YOU WERE PRETTY RAD,
THOUGH.

54
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,332
Y'KNOW THAT BEHEMOTH GUY
WITH THE MINIGUN?

55
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,292
HE WAS KIND OF A LEGEND
IN THE GAME,

56
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,586
'CAUSE HE NEVER BOUGHT IT
IN A SQUAD FIGHT BEFORE.

57
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,670
Sinon: YEAH?

58
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,839
I HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS THAT GOOD.

59
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,802
I NEVER REALLY SAW
HIS RANKINGS IN B. O. B.

60
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,178
Kyoji: HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED.

61
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,555
I MEAN, NO MATTER
HOW POWERFUL A MINIGUN IS,

62
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,765
CARRYING
FIVE HUNDRED ROUNDS OF AMMO

63
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,141
PUSHES YOU
OVER THE WEIGHT LIMIT,

64
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,684
SO YOU CAN'T RUN.

65
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,770
AND SINCE B. O. B.'s
A SOLO ENCOUNTER BATTLE,

66
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,523
HE WAS EASY PICKINGS
FOR A SNIPER LIKE YOU.

67
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,944
STILL, WITH THAT GUN,
HE'S PRETTY MUCH INVINCIBLE

68
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,404
AS LONG AS HE'S
WITH A GOOD SQUAD.

69
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,989
THE MINIGUN
SHOULD BE BANNED

70
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,826
Sinon: IF WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT BANNING WEAPONS,

71
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,954
DON'T FORGET SOME PEOPLE THINK
MY HECATE'S A CHEAT, TOO.

72
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,248
AS ITS OWNER, I HAVE TO ADMIT

73
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,917
USING IT DOES HAVE
ITS OWN SPECIAL PROBLEMS.

74
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,003
Kyoji: (SIGHS) WISH I HAD
PROBLEMS LIKE THAT.

75
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,008
SO WHAT'RE YOUR PLANS
FOR THE NEXT B. O. B.?

76
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,219
Sinon:
I'M DEFINITELY ENTERING.

77
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,471
I DID MY HOMEWORK
AND HAVE MOST OF THE INFO

78
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,765
OF THE TOP TWENTY PLAYERS
FROM THE LAST ONE,

79
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,350
AND I'VE GOT MY HECATE NOW.

80
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,853
WITH HER IN MY HANDS,
I'M SURE I CAN KI‐‐

81
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,314
I‐I MEAN
CRACK THE HIGHER RANKS.

82
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,568
(THINKING) IF I CAN
TAKE OUT ALL MY ENEMIES

83
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,446
AND PROVE I'M THE STRONGEST,
I'LL BE FREE.

84
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,283
Kyoji: MAN...

85
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,285
ASADA, YOU'RE AMAZING.

86
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,620
HAVING THAT AWESOME GUN
IS ONE THING,

87
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,248
BUT YOU WERE ALSO SMART ENOUGH
TO PUT YOUR POINTS

88
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,750
ON STRENGTH STATS
SO YOU COULD USE IT.

89
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,044
I'M THE ONE
WHO GOT YOU INTO G. G. O.,

90
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,963
BUT I'VE BEEN
TOTALLY LEFT BEHIND.

91
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,756
Sinon: THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

92
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,258
IN THE LAST QUALIFIER,

93
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,303
YOU MADE IT ALL THE WAY
TO THE SEMIFINALS, REMEMBER?

94
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,096
Kyoji: EH. WHATEVER.

95
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,224
AN AGI BUILD ONLY GETS YOU
SO FAR IN G. G. O.

96
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,976
A GOOD GUN HELPS, TOO.

97
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,145
I SPENT POINTS
ON THE WRONG STAT.

98
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,480
Sinon: DON'T GET SO DOWN
ABOUT THAT STUFF.

99
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,816
SIGN UP FOR B. O. B.,
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

100
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,693
Kyoji: NAH. NO POINT.

101
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,903
I'D JUST DIE.

102
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,113
Sinon: OH. HMM.

103
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,115
HEY, HOW'RE YOUR STUDIES
COMING ALONG?

104
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,117
YOU STILL WANNA BE A DOCTOR?

105
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,578
Kyoji: YEAH. IT IS
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

106
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,955
I PROMISED MY DAD
I'D GO TO MED SCHOOL,

107
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,583
SO IT'S A DONE DEAL.
STUCK WITH IT NOW.

108
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,711
Sinon: WELL, WHAT ABOUT
CRAM SCHOOL AND THE G. E. D.?

109
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,588
ARE THOSE GOING OKAY?

110
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,132
Kyoji: OH, YEAH.
IT'S GOIN' GREAT.

111
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,510
I'M MAINTAINING THE SAME RANK
I HAD WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL.

112
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,846
STAYIN' SHARP, MA'AM.
LOCKED AND LOADED.

113
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,599
Sinon: ROGER THAT.
(LAUGHING)

114
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,392
Kyoji: (LAUGHING)

115
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,935
Sinon: THE REASON I ASKED,

116
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,979
IS 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
ONLINE WHEN I LOG ON.

117
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,898
THAT'S WHY I WAS
A LITTLE WORRIED.

118
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,400
IF YOU'RE ONLINE THAT MUCH,
WHEN DO YOU STUDY?

119
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,653
Kyoji: I DO MOST OF MY STUDYING
DURING THE DAY,

120
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,655
AND I TAKE LOTS OF BREAKS, TOO.

121
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,448
Sinon: YOU MUST BE
MAKING TONS OF CASH

122
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,241
IF YOU'RE DIVING
ALL THE TIME LIKE THAT.

123
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,285
Kyoji: I'M NOT MAKING THAT MUCH.

124
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,789
SOLO HUNTING'S IMPOSSIBLE
FOR AGI BUILDS THESE DAYS.

125
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,249
Sinon: OH. WELL,
YOU'RE DOING GREAT

126
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,461
IF YOU'RE EARNING ENOUGH
FOR THE CONNECTION FEE.

127
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,421
UH‐OH, IT'S LATE.

128
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,299
SORRY. I HAVE TO GET GOING NOW.

129
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,135
Kyoji: OH. OKAY. HEY, UH...

130
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,179
ARE YOU STILL MAKIN' DINNER
FOR YOURSELF?

131
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,765
I'D LOVE TO TRY MORE
OF YOUR COOKING SOMEDAY.

132
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:57,310
Sinon: HUH? OH, SURE.
OKAY.

133
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,855
IT'S JUST I THINK I NEED
TO GET BETTER AT IT FIRST.

134
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,650
THANKS FOR THE TEA.

135
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,696
AND THANKS‐‐I MEAN,
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME.

136
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,489
YOU WERE PRETTY COOL.

137
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:13,660
Kyoji: I WISH I COULD ALWAYS
BE THERE TO PROTECT YOU.

138
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,370
HEY, UH, IF YOU WANT,

139
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,706
I CAN WALK YOU HOME
EVERY DAY.

140
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,499
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT.

141
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,834
Sinon: OH, NO, NO.

142
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,001
THAT'S OKAY.

143
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,378
I'LL BE FINE.

144
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,422
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'LL GET STRONGER.

145
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,195
WHAT A DAY.

146
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,597
I CAN DO THIS.

I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT DAD LOOKED LIKE.

151
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,023
I REMEMBER HEARING HE DIED
IN A CAR ACCIDENT, THOUGH,

152
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,859
SOMETIME BEFORE I TURNED TWO.

153
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,862
AFTER THE ACCIDENT,
MY MOM AND I LEFT TOKYO.

154
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,532
WE WENT TO GO LIVE
WITH HER PARENTS.

155
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,827
IT WAS PEACEFUL THERE
FOR BOTH OF US.

156

Sinon: AND THEN ONE DAY,

159
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,885
THAT PEACE WAS SHATTERED.

00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,934
OR I'M GONNA KILL HER NEXT!

174
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,895
I SWEAR I'LL DO IT!

175
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,273
(SCREAMS)

176
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
YOU LITTLE...

177
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,453
GIVE IT BACK, YOU BRAT! LET GO!

178
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,538
LET GO OF MY GUN!

179
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,708
(GUNSHOT)

180
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,426
(SCREAMS)

181
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,401
Sinon: (SCREAMING)

182
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,125
Robber: (LAUGHS)

183
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,422
(RUNNING FOOTSTEPS)

184
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,967
Sinon: (VOMITS)

185
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,844
(COUGHING)

186
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,304
(VOMITS)

187
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,309
(TOILET FLUSHING)

188
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,247
I LOOK AWFUL

189
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,176
SOMEBODY...

190
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,971
ANYBODY SAVE ME.

191
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,985
Asuna: WAIT! WHAT?!
Y‐YOU'RE KIDDING!

192
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,445
YOU'RE QUITTING A. L. O.?!

193
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,864
Kirito: N‐NO!

194
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,699
I'LL JUST BE GONE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

195
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,035
I'LL CONVERT BACK AFTER THAT.

196
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,120
Asuna: BUT WHY?

197
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,164
Kirito: WELL, ACTUALLY...

198
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,832
IT'S COMPLICATED.

199
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,669
THERE'S THIS OTHER VIRTUAL MMO
THAT I NEED TO CHECK OUT.

200
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,296
Asuna: "NEED TO," HUH?

201
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,882
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE
AND JUST USED NEW ACCOUNTS.

202
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,634
WHY NOT FOR THIS ONE, TOO?

203
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,720
I MEAN, IF YOU CONVERT,
YOUR ITEMS WILL BE RESET.

204
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,056
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

205
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,266
Kirito:
WELL, IT'S LIKE A FAVOR

206
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,519
FOR THAT GUY
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

207
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,028
Asuna: I GUESS IF MR. KIKUOKA'S
ASKING YOU TO,

208
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,613
YOU CAN'T SAY NO.

209
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,990
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS ABOUT THAT MAN,

210
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,408
BUT THERE'S A PART OF ME

211
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,911
THAT STILL HAS
A HARD TIME TRUSTING HIM.

212
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,081
Kirito: YEAH. I'M NOT TOO SURE
I CAN TRUST HIM, EITHER.

213
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,168
Asuna: JUST GET BACK
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

214
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,503
THIS IS OUR HOME,

215
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,797
AND IT'S NOT THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU.

216
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,675
(GEAR CLANKING)

217
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,933
Kirito: DON'T WORRY.

218
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,227
I'LL BE BACK IN A.L.O.
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

219
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,146
I'LL JUST DIVE
INTO GUN GALE ONLINE

220
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,439
FOR A COUPLE DAYS,
SEE WHAT'S GOIN' ON,

221
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,482
AND THAT'S THAT.

222
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,986
I'M NINETY‐NINE PERCENT SURE

223
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,988
THE DEATH GUN STORY'S A HOAX,

224
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,406
PROBABLY SOMEONE TROLLING.

225
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,324
YOU CAN'T KILL SOMEONE

226
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,910
IN THE REAL WORLD
FROM THE VIRTUAL ANYMORE.

227
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,371
I KNOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

228
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,498
Death Gun:
THIS IS REAL POWER,

229
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,333
REAL STRENGTH!

230
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,379
LET YOUR FEAR CARVE ONE NAME
INTO YOUR BRAINS,

231
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,840
THE NAME I SHARE
WITH THIS WEAPON,

232
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,800
DEATH GUN!

233
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,137
Kirito: BUT THERE'S STILL

234
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,931
THAT ONE PERCENT CHANCE
IT COULD BE TRUE.

235
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,434
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

236
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,735
HELLO. ANYONE HERE?

237
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,986
Aki: YEP!

238
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,697
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, KIRIGAYA?

239
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,451
Kirito: MS. AKI.

240
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,661
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

241
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,039
(GASPS)

242
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,165
Aki: WHOA!

243
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,958
YOU FINALLY
GOT SOME MEAT ON YOU.

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,835
YOU COULD USE SOME FILLING OUT,
THOUGH.

245
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,212
YOU SURE YOU'RE EATING RIGHT?

246
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,172
Kirito: YEAH, I'M EATING.
I'M EATING.

247
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,382
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

248
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,509
Aki: YOUR FRIEND
IN THE SUIT AND GLASSES

249
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,261
TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR MISSION.

250
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,348
HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
YOU GOING INTO A VIRTUAL NETWORK

251
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,558
AND DOING SOME RECONNAISSANCE
OR SOMETHING.

252
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,310
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'D ASK YOU.

253
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,187
I MEAN, YOU'VE ONLY BEEN
BACK FOR A YEAR.

254
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,563
ANYWAY, HE FOUND OUT

255
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,233
I WAS THE ONE
WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF YOUR REHAB,

256
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,569
SO HE ASKED ME TO KEEP AN EYE
ON YOUR MONITORS WHILE YOU DIVE.

257
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,655
THEY TOOK ME OFF MY NORMAL SHIFT
AND EVERYTHING.

258
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,615
THE HEAD NURSE WASN'T HAPPY,

259
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,116
BUT WHAT CAN SHE DO ABOUT IT?

260
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,368
IF THE GOVERNMENT
WANTS SOMETHING,

261
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,911
THEY'RE GONNA GET IT.

262
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,623
WELL, I GUESS YOU AND ME
ARE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, HUH?

263
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,085
Kirito: YEAH.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

264
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,588
UM, SO IT'S JUST US TODAY?
NO KIKUOKA?

265
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,967
Aki: MM‐HMM. HE ASKED ME
TO GIVE YOU A MESSAGE, THOUGH.

266
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,725
Kikuoka: EMAIL YOUR REPORTS
TO ME AT THE USUAL ADDRESS.

267
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,936
YOUR FEE AND EXPENSES
WILL BE PAID

268
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,563
WHEN YOU FINISH THE MISSION,

269
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,065
SO PLEASE DON'T FORGET
TO SEND ME AN INVOICE.

270
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,110
P.S. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALONE
WITH A PRETTY NURSE,

271
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,695
YOU'RE STILL ON THE CLOCK.

272
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,282
TRY TO KEEP THOSE HORMONES
OF YOURS UNDER CONTROL.

273
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,370
Kirito: UH, IF IT'S OKAY,

274
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,372
I'D LIKE TO CONNECT
TO THE NETWORK NOW.

275
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,500
Aki: YEAH, SURE.
IT'S ALL SET UP.

276
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,967
OKAY, HOT STUFF, STRIP!

277
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,302
Kirito: WHY?!

278
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,053
Aki: FOR THE ELECTRODES.

279
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,388
OH, DON'T BE SHY.

280
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,599
I'VE SEEN
ALL YOUR GOODIES BEFORE.

281
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,852
Kirito: UH, ACTUALLY,
CAN I JUST TAKE OFF MY SHIRT?

282
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,314
Aki: MM‐HMM.

283
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,274
Kirito: (SIGHS)

284
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,654
Aki: THERE.
YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

285
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,079
Kirito: WELL, HERE I GO.
WISH ME LUCK.

286
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,291
I DON'T SEE THIS TAKIN' ME
MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE HOURS.

287
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,959
Aki: YOU GOT IT.

288
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,462
AND DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
YOUR BODY WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

289
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,213
I'LL KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON IT.

290
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,091
Kirito: THANKS.
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY

291
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,100
LINK START!

292
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,733
Sinon: YEAH, I'M DOING GREAT.

293
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,360
I'M USED TO THE SCHOOL NOW,

294
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,403
AND I'VE MADE
SOME FRIENDS, TOO.

295
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,948
I'M FINE, REALLY.

296
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,951
I'VE ONLY HAD A COUPLE
PANIC ATTACKS. THAT'S ALL.

297
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,913
YEAH, GRANDPA, I WILL.

298
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,624
DON'T YOU CATCH
ANY COLDS, EITHER.

299
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,626
I'LL COME HOME
FOR WINTER BREAK.

300
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,253
ME, TOO. BYE.

301
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,593
EVER SINCE THAT DAY,

302
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,262
WHENEVER I SEE A GUN,
I FREAK OUT.

303
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,724
IF I SEE A PICTURE OF ONE
OR SEE ONE ON TV,

304
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,227
I'M GUARANTEED A PANIC ATTACK.

305
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,479
I CAME TO TOKYO
FOR HIGH SCHOOL,

306
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,024
THINKING IF I GOT FAR ENOUGH
AWAY FROM HOME, IT'D HELP,

307
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,401
BUT IT DIDN'T.

308
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,866
ONE DAY, SHINKAWA TOLD ME
ABOUT GUN GALE ONLINE,

309
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,161
AND I THOUGHT IT COULD WORK
AS A KIND OF THERAPY FOR ME.

310
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,956
AND IN A WAY, IT WORKED.

311
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,542
AS SINON,
WHEN I'M HOLDING A GUN

312
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,502
OR WHEN SOMEONE'S
DRAWING DOWN ON ME,

313
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,878
I CAN HANDLE IT.

314
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,135
I FIGURE
THE STRONGER SINON GETS,

315
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,804
THE STRONGER I'LL GET
IN THE REAL WORLD,

316
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,640
SO I KEEP FIGHTING
WITH MY HECATE TWO,

317
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,476
HOPING IT'LL HELP ME
KICK THIS PHOBIA.

318
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,941
WINNING THE NEXT
BULLET OF BULLETS WILL CURE ME.

319
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,360
I KNOW IT WILL.

320
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,654
IT HAS TO.

321
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,906
LINK START.

322
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,919
Player 1: ZXE‐D AND TARAKO
HAVEN'T LOGGED ON FOR A WHILE.

323
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,546
IT'S BEEN, LIKE, A MONTH.

324
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,299
IF ANYONE'S GOT THEIR
CONTACT INFO IN THE REAL WORLD,

325
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,092
HOOK US UP WITH IT.

326
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,553
Player 2: DUDE, IF NO ONE'S
HEARD FROM 'EM THIS LONG,

327
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,763
THEY'RE GONE FOR GOOD.

328
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,556
Player 3:
WE KNOW THE DATE AND TIME

329
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,974
THEY WERE SHOT
BY DEATH GUN, THOUGH,

330
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,726
SO ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS CHECK

331
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,686
IF ANY VRMMO PLAYERS
DIED AROUND THAT TIME,

332
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,772
AND WE'LL KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO 'EM.

333
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,648
Player 1: YEAH,
BUT IF THEY LIVED ALONE,

334
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,317
MAYBE NO ONE'S FOUND
THEIR BODIES YET.

335
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,611
WE ALREADY ASKED THE COPS,
BUT THEY'RE NOT TALKING.

336
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,863
WE EVEN SENT EMAILS TO ZASKAR
ABOUT 'EM,

337
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,199
BUT ALL THEY SENT BACK
WAS THE OLD,

338
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,160
"SORRY, WE NEVER SHARE
OUR USERS' PERSONAL INFO" CRAP.

339
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,495
Player 3:
I HATE TO SAY IT,

340
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,288
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO BE
SURE THEY WERE KILLED

341
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,915
IS FOR ONE OF US
TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF.

342
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,583
SO TOMORROW AT 11:30 P. M.,

343
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,127
I'M GONNA WAIT FOR DEATH GUN
AT THE GLOCKEN CENTRAL BANK,

344
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,420
AND JUST SO HE KNOWS IT'S ME,

345
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,088
I'LL HAVE A RED ROSE
ON MY CHEST.

346
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,591
SHOOT ME, DEATH GUN!
I DARE YOU.

347
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,343
Player 1: AH, DUDE,
YOU'LL BE A HERO.

348
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,220
BUT YOU BETTER POST
YOUR REAL NAME AND ADDRESS.

349
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,347
OTHERWISE, WHAT'S THE POINT?

350
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,016
Player 2: OH, DO A PUBLIC DIVE
AT AN INTERNET CAFE, MAN!

351
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,976
Player 1: (LAUGHING) DO IT!

352
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,186
DO IT!

353
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,562
Death Gun: WHATEVER.
