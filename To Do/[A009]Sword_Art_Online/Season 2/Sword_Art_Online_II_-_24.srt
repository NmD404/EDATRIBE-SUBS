IN SOME OTHER PLACE,
SOME OTHER WORLD.

178
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,962
I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT I'LL FIND YOU,

179
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,130
AND THEN WE CAN SIT AND TALK,

180
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,549
AND YOU COULD TELL ME
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN.

181
00:12:55,817 --> 00:13:01,072
Yuuki, thinking: I GAVE
THIS LIFE EVERYTHING I HAD.

182
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,741
I WAS ALIVE.

183
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,636
(MUSIC PLAYING)

184
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,354
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

185
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:56,335
Yuuki: I NEVER MADE ANYTHING
OR GAVE ANYTHING TO ANYONE.

186
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,963
Asuna: YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING.

187
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,591
YOU CARVED IT
DEEP INTO MY HEART,

188
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,926
AND IT'LL ALWAYS BE THERE.

189
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,685
Woman: HELLO, ASUNA.

190
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,978
HOW ARE YOU?

191
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,649
Asuna: WAIT.
IS THAT YOU, SIUNE?

192
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,152
Siune: YES, IN THE FLESH.

193
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,780
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY
MEET YOU IN THE REAL WORLD.

194
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,114
I'M SHI‐EUN AN.

195
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,784
Asuna: OH!
I‐IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.

196
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,577
I'M ASUNA YUUKI.

197
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,288
LIKE MEETING
FOR THE FIRST TIME, HUH?

198
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,956
Both: (LAUGH)

199
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,168
‐ Asuna: BUT‐‐
‐ Siune: NO, IT'S OKAY.

200
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,296
JUST THIS MONTH, I GOT
THE ALL‐CLEAR FROM MY DOCTOR

201
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,173
AND WAS DISCHARGED
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

202
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,841
Asuna: THEN,
YOU'RE DOING BETTER?

203
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
Siune: YES.

204
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,386
THE TYPE OF DISEASE I HAVE

205
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,305
IS CALLED
ACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA,

206
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,975
AND IT WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
WHEN I DEVELOPED IT.

207
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,354
THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM
THE MEDICINE WERE SO HORRIBLE,

208
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,232
I WANTED TO DIE
RATHER THAN KEEP SUFFERING,

209
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,777
BUT WHENEVER I SAW YUUKI,
I THOUGHT, "HERE'S THIS KID,

210
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,447
AND SHE'S HANDLING HER SITUATION
BETTER THAN I'M HANDLING MINE."

211
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,865
AROUND FEBRUARY,

212
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,952
THEY STARTED CUTTING BACK
ON THE MEDS I WAS ON.

213
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,578
I THOUGHT, "THIS IS IT,"

214
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,914
AND I BRACED MYSELF FOR THE END.

215
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,375
AND THEN A WEEK AGO,

216
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,001
THE DAY AFTER YUUKI DIED,

217
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,003
MY DOCTOR CAME IN AND SAID,

218
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,091
"CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE IN COMPLETE REMISSION."

219
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,342
NEXT THING I KNEW,

220
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,635
I WAS BEING DISCHARGED.

221
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,513
I BARELY HAD A CHANCE
TO PROCESS THE NEWS.

222
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:35,351
AND THE TRUTH IS,
IT STILL HASN'T SUNK IN YET.

223
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,187
IT'S LIKE I SHOULD FEEL AWFUL.

224
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,605
IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR

225
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,941
THAT I'M STILL HERE
AND YUUKI'S WAITING.

226
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,361
YUUKI AND RAN,
CLOVIS AND MERIDA,

227
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,739
WE PROMISED
WE'D STICK TOGETHER FOREVER,

228
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,783
AND I‐I'M HERE, AND‐‐

229
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,161
Asuna: SHI‐EUN.

230
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,122
YOU KNOW,
OUR LIVES ARE LIKE VESSELS,

231
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,790
AND WE CARRY THE TEACHINGS

232
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,084
OF THE ONES
WHO'VE PASSED IN THEM.

233
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,753
FOR THE LONGEST TIME,
I WAS SO SCARED,

234
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,423
SCARED OF TELLING SOMEONE
HOW I REALLY FELT

235
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,592
AND SCARED OF FINDING OUT
HOW THEY FELT.

236
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,427
BUT I LEARNED FROM YUUKI

237
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,180
THAT THAT WAS NO WAY
FOR ME TO LIVE.

238
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,182
IF I DIDN'T EVEN
TRY TO REACH OUT,

239
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,393
NOTHING WOULD EVER CHANGE.

240
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,465
SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO BE STRONG,

241
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:22,467
AND I WANT TO SHARE THAT
WITH OTHERS.

242
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:24,427
AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE,

243
00:16:24,469 --> 00:16:27,639
I'LL PASS ON WHAT I LEARNED
FROM HER TO EVERYONE I MEET,

244
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,099
AND THEN SOMEDAY,
WHEN I SEE HER AGAIN,

245
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:33,478
I WANT TO TELL HER ABOUT
ALL THE PEOPLE SHE'S HELPED.

246
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,104
THAT'S HOW I'LL PAY HER BACK.

247
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,817
Siune: THANK YOU, ASUNA.

248
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:49,702
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL SO GRATEFUL
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

249
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:51,913
I'D BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT YUUKI.

250
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:54,374
SHE WAS CARRYING A HEAVY BURDEN

251
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:56,376
ON THOSE
LITTLE SHOULDERS OF HERS,

252
00:16:56,417 --> 00:17:00,380
BUT THEN YOU SHOWED UP,
AND SOMETHING IN HER CHANGED.

253
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:02,924
WHEN YOU WERE TOGETHER,

254
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:05,593
YUUKI SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS
REALLY HAVING FUN.

255
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:09,305
SHE WAS LIKE A FORGETFUL BIRD
WHO REMEMBERED HOW TO FLY,

256
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:15,144
AND SHE FLEW UP AND UP,
AND NOW SHE'S OUT OF OUR REACH.

257
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:20,942
ANYWAY, JUN'S ALSO DOING GREAT.

258
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:23,820
THE MEDICATION HE'S ON
SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

259
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,321
IT'S LIKE‐‐I DON'T KNOW.

260
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,866
TO ME, IT FEELS LIKE YUUKI'S
TELLING ALL OF US

261
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:29,576
IT'S STILL TOO SOON TO JOIN HER.

262
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:32,662
I GUESS THAT MEANS
IT'S GOING TO BE A WHILE YET

263
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,497
BEFORE THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS
GET BACK TOGETHER.

264
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:37,917
Asuna: JUST REMEMBER, NEXT TIME,
YOU'RE TAKING ME IN AS A MEMBER,

265
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,211
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY ARGUMENTS.

266
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:41,212
Both: (LAUGH)

267
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:42,422
Kirito: HEY.

268
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:46,843
I HOPE WE'RE
NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

269
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:48,511
Asuna: NO. BUT WAIT.

270
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:50,346
DO YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER?

271
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:51,389
Kirito: SORT OF.

272
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:53,391
HE'S TRYING TO STEAL MY IDEAS

273
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,393
ABOUT THAT COMMUNICATIONS POD
I MADE.

274
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:57,020
Dr. Kurahashi: NO, HE'S LYING.

275
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:58,563
I'M INTERESTED
IN ITS POSSIBILITIES

276
00:17:58,605 --> 00:17:59,898
IN FULL‐DIVE MEDICAL TECH,

277
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,691
SO WE'VE BEEN
E‐MAILING BACK AND FORTH.

278
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,776
Asuna: THAT'S GREAT
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

279
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:05,445
WHAT ABOUT THE MEDICUBOID?

280
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:08,907
ARE YOU GOING TO PHASE IT OUT,
OR WERE THE TRIALS SUCCESSFUL?

281
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:11,576
Dr. Kurahashi: GLAD YOU ASKED.
THEY WERE EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL,

282
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:15,079
AND NOW WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA
TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT PHASE.

283
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:17,248
SOON, PATIENTS ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE‐‐

284
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,167
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

285
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,836
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DIDN'T SAY THIS FIRST.

286
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:24,797
MS. AN, CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR RECOVERY.

287
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,884
I KNOW YUUKI WOULD BE THRILLED
AT THE NEWS, TOO.

288
00:18:29,052 --> 00:18:30,970
Siune: THANK YOU FOR SAYING SO,

289
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:32,597
AND CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE TRIALS.

290
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:35,516
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
WHAT YOU LEARNED FROM YUUKI

291
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:37,143
WILL BE USED TO HELP OTHERS.

292
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:38,394
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

293
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:39,854
Dr. Kurahashi: ME, TOO.

294
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:42,857
YUUKI WAS THE FIRST PERSON
TO TEST THE MEDICUBOID,

295
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,360
AND HER NAME
WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED.

296
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:48,780
IF SHE WERE HERE,
SHE'D GET AN AWARD FOR HER HELP,

297
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:51,282
ALONG WITH THE BENEFACTOR
WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE.

298
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:52,825
Siune: KNOWING YUUKI,

299
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:55,161
SHE WOULDN'T BE TOO THRILLED
AT GETTING AN AWARD.

300
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:57,163
SHE'D SAY,
"WHAT'S THE POINT IN HAVING IT

301
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:58,248
IF I CAN'T EAT IT?"

302
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,250
All: (LAUGH)

303
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:04,754
Asuna: UM, DOCTOR,
YOU JUST MENTIONED

304
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:07,215
THE MEDICUBOID
HAD SOME KIND OF BENEFACTOR?

305
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,383
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

306
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:10,260
THE GOVERNMENT
WAS PAYING FOR IT.

307
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:12,470
Dr. Kurahashi:
OH, WELL, YES, THEY ARE,

308
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:13,805
BUT THE INITIAL DESIGNS

309
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:16,182
WERE GIVEN TO US FOR FREE
FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

310
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:18,268
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

311
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:22,146
I THINK HER NAME
WAS DR. RINKO KOUJIRO.

312
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,233
Kirito: (GASPS)

313
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,694
Asuna: W‐WHAT'S WRONG, KIRITO?

314
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:30,029
Kirito: I‐‐I KNOW HER

315
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:31,030
Asuna: HOW?

316
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:33,199
Kirito: I MET HER ONCE.

317
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:35,576
YEAH, IN FACT,
SHE WAS TAKING CARE

318
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:38,162
OF HEATHCLIFF'S BODY
WHILE HE WAS DIVING.

319
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:39,998
SHE WAS HIS HEAD RESEARCHER.

320
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,001
SHE HELPED HIM DEVELOP
FULL‐DIVE TECHNOLOGY.

321
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:45,837
YOU SEE?
THE MEDICUBOID'S DESIGN,

322
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,505
YOU KNOW WHO INVENTED IT?

323
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:49,424
Asuna: NO WAY.

324
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:51,009
IT WAS KAYABA.

325
00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:45,957
Agil: NEED ANY HELP
UNPACKING ALL THIS STUFF?

326
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:47,917
Leafa: SURE,
BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE NOT BUSY.

327
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,836
Klein: SERIOUSLY,
AIN'T SHE CUTE?

328
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:50,878
‐ Lisbeth: UH...
‐ Silica: UH...

329
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,588
Leafa: I GOT YOU A LITTLE GIFT.

330
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,298
Sinon: NO WAY.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

331
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,925
‐ Leafa: HEY...
‐ Klein: YOU GUYS SUCK.

332
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,302
Asuna: ARE YOU HAVING FUN
HANGING OUT HERE WITH EVERYONE?

333
00:21:58,344 --> 00:21:59,470
Yui: YES!

334
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:01,097
AND THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS
ARE PRETTY.

335
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:03,182
Kirito: YEAH, IT'S TOO BAD
THEY'RE ALMOST GONE.

336
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:04,434
Asuna: OH, PLEASE,

337
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:05,768
THERE'S PLENTY LEFT,
YOU SPOILSPORT.

338
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,770
ANYWAY, WE'RE HERE WITH YUI.

339
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:09,522
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.

340
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:12,275
Kirito: I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
WE MADE IT HAPPEN THAT FAST.

341
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:14,277
Yui: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THIS, DADDY.

342
00:22:14,318 --> 00:22:15,570
Asuna: YEAH, KIRITO, THANK YOU.

343
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:17,864
Kirito: NAH, IF YOU WANT
TO THANK SOMEONE,

344
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:20,533
THANK YUUKI
FOR HELPING ME DEVELOP IT.

345
00:22:23,244 --> 00:22:24,203
(WIND GUSTS)

346
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:26,080
Yui: WOW!

347
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,418
Kirito: THE REAL WORLD
AND THE VIRTUAL,

348
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,753
I THOUGHT THE CLOSER
THEY CAME TOGETHER,

349
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:34,422
THE BETTER THE FUTURE WOULD BE.

350
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:35,673
Asuna: HM?

351
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:37,758
Kirito: IT'S LIKE
THE MORE THE LINES

352
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,177
BETWEEN THESE WORLDS BLUR,

353
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:41,554
THE MORE EVERYONE
GETS SUCKED INTO ITS DARKNESS.

354
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:46,267
Asuna: YEAH, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN HELPED BY IT, TOO.

355
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:48,227
Kirito: IF ANYTHING,

356
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:51,689
I WISH I KNEW
WHAT KAYABA'S MASTER PLAN WAS.

357
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:54,025
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT'S OUR JOB

358
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:56,486
AS SURVIVORS OF "S. A. O."
TO FIND OUT.

359
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,446
Asuna: I THINK
YOU'RE OVERTHINKING THINGS.

360
00:22:58,488 --> 00:22:59,822
Kirito: YEAH, I GUESS.

361
00:22:59,864 --> 00:23:03,075
STILL, I WANNA FIND OUT
MORE THAN EVER NOW.

362
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:05,077
EVEN AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,

363
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,996
MY CURIOSITY'S GOT ME HOOKED.

364
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,333
ALTHOUGH, A PART OF ME
THINKS I'M BEING PLAYED HERE.

365
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:11,626
THAT'S KIND OF ANNOYING.

366
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,253
WHATEVER.

367
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:17,173
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW.

368
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:20,760
ALL I KNOW IS
I WANNA BE WITH YOU FOREVER,

369
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,720
AND I WANT YOU TO BE WITH ME.

370
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:24,430
Asuna: (LAUGHS)
I'LL STICK BY YOU,

371
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:26,641
EVEN IF YOU MOVE
HALFWAY ACROSS THE PLANET.

372
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:29,519
Kirito: WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT MOVING?

373
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,854
Yui: DON'T FORGET
TO TAKE ME ALONG.

374
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:34,106
Lisbeth: HEY, LOVEBIRDS!

375
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:37,068
QUIT MAKIN' OUT!
WE WANNA TAKE A PHOTO!

376
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:39,320
‐ Klein: GET OVER HERE, GUYS!
‐ Lisbeth: TODAY, GUYS!

377
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:41,239
‐ Agil: HURRY UP!
‐ Klein: MOVE IT, DUDE!

378
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,615
Kirito: WELL, SHALL WE?

379
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:43,616
Asuna: MM‐HMM.

380
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,326
Yui: OKAY, DADDY.
