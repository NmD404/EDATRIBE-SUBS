1
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,219
Yuuki: HEY, GUYS!

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,929
THIS IS MISS ASUNA.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,350
MISS ASUNA, THIS IS MY GUILD,
THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS!

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,684
Jun: MY NAME'S JUN.

5
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,520
WHAT'S UP? HOW'S IT GOING?

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,022
Talken: H‐HI, MISS ASUNA.

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,774
I‐I'M TALKEN.

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,442
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU‐‐

9
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,610
AH!

10
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,362
Nori: YOU REALLY NEED
TO GET A GRIP

11
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,072
ON THOSE NERVES, TAL, SERIOUSLY.

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,784
EVERY TIME YOU MEET A GIRL,
YOU TURN INTO A BLUBBERING MESS.

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,202
ANYWAY, MY NAME'S NORI.

14
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,537
GLAD TO MEET YA.

15
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,038
Siune: MY NAME IS SIUNE.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,540
IT'S WONDERFUL TO MEET YOU,

17
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,750
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING TODAY.

18
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,460
Tecchi: IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

19
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,461
MY NAME'S TECCHI.

20
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,547
Yuuki: AND...

21
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,341
I'M YUUKI, THE LEADER
OF THIS GUILD, KINDA, SORTA.

22
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,052
MISS ASUNA, DON'T LAUGH,

23
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,346
BUT SEE,
WE WANNA BE THE ONLY GUILD

24
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,306
TO BEAT THE BOSS ON THIS FLOOR,

25
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,058
AND WE WANT YOU TO HELP US!

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,977
Asuna: HUH?

27
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,019
(GASPS)

28
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,521
HUH?!

29
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,022
Yuuki: (CHUCKLES)

30
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,037
Asuna: THAT'S VERY AMBITIOUS,

31
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,123
BUT A BOSS RAID USUALLY TAKES
AT LEAST FORTY‐NINE PLAYERS.

32
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,376
THAT'S SEVEN PARTIES
WITH SEVEN PLAYERS APIECE,

33
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,670
SO NO MATTER
HOW SKILLED YOU ARE,

34
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,672
WITH JUST SEVEN PLAYERS,
THAT'S KIND OF‐‐

35
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,132
WELL, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,
IT'S UNREALISTIC.

36
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,551
Yuuki: YEAH,
IT SORTA IS, ISN'T IT?

37
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,595
WE TRIED TAKING ON THE BOSSES

38
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,806
ON FLOOR TWENTY‐FIVE
AND ‐SIX THE SAME WAY.

39
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,474
Asuna: HUH?! J‐JUST YOU SIX?

40
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,017
Yuuki: YUP.

41
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,729
AND IF YOU ASK ME, WE PUT UP
A PRETTY GOOD FIGHT, TOO,

42
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,940
BUT BOTH TIMES,
THIS HUGE GUILD SWOOPED IN

43
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,026
AND BEAT 'EM BEFORE WE
COULD FIGURE OUT OUR NEXT MOVE.

44
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,529
Asuna: WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN RISK IT?

45
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,281
Siune: THAT'S A STORY.

46
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,368
IT GOES BACK TO WHEN WE MET
IN ANOTHER GAME'S NET COMMUNITY.

47
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,496
WE HIT IT OFF RIGHT AWAY, AND
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS EVER SINCE.

48
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,082
BUT WE ONLY HAVE
UNTIL NEXT SPRING

49
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,793
TO GO ON QUESTS TOGETHER.
SINCE OUR TIME'S LIMITED,

50
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,754
WE WANTED
TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.

51
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,923
YOU SEE, COME SPRING,

52
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,134
WE'LL ALL
BE BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS,

53
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,761
SO WE DECIDED THAT BEFORE
WE DISBANDED THE GUILD,

54
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,805
WE HAD TO DO
SOMETHING SO AMAZING,

55
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,390
SO UNBELIEVABLE
WE'D REMEMBER IT FOREVER.

56
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,975
Nori: MM‐HMM.

57
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,978
Asuna: SO THAT'S WHY YOU
WANT TO DO THIS BOSS RAID.

58
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,272
Siune: EXACTLY!
IF WE DEFEAT A BOSS TOGETHER,

59
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,442
OUR NAMES WILL BE INSCRIBED
ON THE MONUMENT OF SWORDSMEN,

60
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,819
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
IN THE TOWN OF BEGINNINGS,

61
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,154
IN THE BLACK IRON PALACE.

62
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,448
I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY

63
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,450
AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE VAIN,

64
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,618
BUT WE REALLY WANT
TO GET OUR NAMES

65
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,579
UP ON THAT WALL, NO MATTER WHAT.

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,581
BUT GETTING THEM ON THERE'S
THE HARD PART.

67
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,832
Asuna: HMM?

68
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,293
Siune: IF A BOSS
IS DEFEATED BY A PARTY,

69
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,794
THEN ALL OF ITS MEMBERS

70
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,796
WILL GET THEIR NAMES
INSCRIBED ON THE MONUMENT,

71
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,799
BUT IF IT'S BEATEN BY MULTIPLE
PARTIES WORKING IN TANDEM,

72
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,760
ONLY THE NAMES OF
THE PARTY LEADERS GET INSCRIBED.

73
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,928
Asuna: OH.

74
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,013
Siune: THAT'S THE CATCH.

75
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,973
IF WE WANT
THE NAMES OF EVERYONE

76
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,725
IN THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS
UP ON THAT WALL,

77
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:31,688
WE HAVE TO BEAT THE BOSS
TOGETHER, JUST US, NO ONE ELSE,

78
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,149
SO WE TALKED IT OVER
AND CAME UP WITH A PLAN.

79
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,068
A PARTY CAN HAVE
UP TO SEVEN PLAYERS MAX,

80
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,363
THEREFORE WE DECIDED
TO FIND SOMEONE AS STRONG

81
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,950
OR EVEN STRONGER THAN
OUR MOST POWERFUL PLAYER, YUUKI,

82
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,537
AND HOPE WHOEVER WE FOUND
ACCEPTED OUR INVITATION.

83
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,081
Asuna: I GET IT.
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE DUELING.

84
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,710
Siune: WELL? WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT JOINING UP WITH US?

85
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,462
WE CAN'T PAY YOU VERY MUCH,

86
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,172
BUT YOU'RE WELCOME
TO WHAT WE HAVE.

87
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,508
Asuna: UH, OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY!

88
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,760
BOSS RAIDS
COST A FORTUNE AS IT IS,

89
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,845
SO YOU SHOULD USE
YOUR MONEY FOR THAT.

90
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,806
I'D FEEL HORRIBLE
TAKING YOUR MONEY, REALLY.

91
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,892
IF YOU WANT, YOU COULD GIVE ME
WHATEVER THE BOSS DROPS,

92
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,310
AND I'LL BE FINE.

93
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,270
Siune: REALLY?!
THEN YOU'LL JOIN OUR PARTY?

94
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
Sleeping Knights: (LAUGHING)

95
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,703
Asuna: HUH.

96
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,791
(THINKING) THIS IS NOTHING
LIKE HOW THE OLD AINCRAD WAS,

97
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,584
AND YET HERE I AM

98
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:39,798
THINKING ABOUT SAFETY MARGINS
AND THE ODDS OF WINNING,

99
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,009
HAVING SAFE FIGHTS
AND CERTAIN VICTORIES.

100
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,388
THERE'S MORE FUN
TO GAMES THAN THAT.

101
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,727
I BET YUUKI AND HER FRIENDS
ALREADY KNOW THIS

102
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,354
BETTER THAN I DO.

103
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,735
OKAY, LET'S SEE
HOW FAR WE CAN GO.

104
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,320
‐ Jun: YES!
‐ Tecchi: AWESOME.

105
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,864
Asuna: IN THE END, IT'S NOT
ABOUT WINNING OR LOSING.

106
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,990
IT'S HAVING FU‐‐

107
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,991
Yuuki: THANKS A BUNCH,
MISS ASUNA!

108
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,618
Asuna: (CHUCKLES) PLEASE,

109
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,079
I‐I'D PREFER IT IF YOU
JUST CALLED ME ASUNA.

110
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,164
Yuuki: (GIGGLES)
THEN YOU CAN CALL ME YUUKI.

111
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,000
Nori: SO, WHAT DO YA THINK?
SHE'S CUTE, HUH?

112
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,378
Asuna: THAT REMINDS ME,
MS. YUUKI‐‐SORRY, YUUKI...

113
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,797
THE DUEL WAS ALL ABOUT
TESTING PLAYERS, RIGHT?

114
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,048
Yuuki: YUP. PRETTY MUCH.

115
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,842
THEN YOU MUST'VE GONE UP AGAINST

116
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,469
A TON OF STRONG PLAYERS
BEFORE I SHOWED UP.

117
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,931
DO YOU REMEMBER EVER FIGHTING
A SPRIGGAN, DRESSED IN BLACK?

118
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,893
HE WOULD'VE BEEN USING
A ONE‐HANDED SWORD.

119
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,394
Yuuki: HUH.

120
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,146
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DO.

121
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,523
MAN, HE WAS PRETTY TOUGH.

122
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,776
Asuna: THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
ASK HIM TO HELP YOU OUT?

123
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,112
Yuuki: MM, I DON'T KNOW.

124
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,447
HE JUST WASN'T RIGHT.

125
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,157
Asuna: WELL, WHY NOT?

126
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,576
Yuuki: HE FOUND OUT MY SECRET.

127
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,202
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

128
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,625
Asuna: OKAY, SO FOR TOMORROW,

129
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,376
HOW 'BOUT WE MEET
BACK HERE AT 1:00?

130
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,003
‐ Jun: YOU GOT IT!
‐ Yuuki: YOU GOT IT!

131
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,630
‐ Tecchi: ROGER THAT.
‐ Siune: WHAT THEY SAID.

132
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,006
Asuna: AND LET'S HAVE FUN.

133
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,049
Sleeping Dragons: RIGHT!

134
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,015
Asuna: (CHUCKLES)

135
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,980
(SIGHS)

136
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,570
(THRUMMING)

137
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,120
(GASPS)

138
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,833
(SIGHING)

139
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,381
(GASPS)

140
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,216
WH‐‐

141
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,010
MOM? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

142
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,973
Kyoko: LAST MONTH,
WHEN YOU WERE LATE FOR DINNER,

143
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,101
I TOLD YOU
IT BETTER NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

144
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,519
AND HERE WE ARE.

145
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,937
YOU'RE LATE
BECAUSE OF THAT GAME,

146
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,855
SO NOW YOU LOSE YOUR PRIVILEGES.

147
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,899
Asuna: I JUST
LOST TRACK OF TIME.

148
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,651
THAT'S MY FAULT, AND I'M SORRY.

149
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,445
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO AND
PULL THE PLUG ON ME LIKE THAT.

150
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,240
YOU COULD'VE SHAKEN ME
OR EVEN YELLED IN MY EAR.

151
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,783
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN
AN ALERT IN‐GAME,

152
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,076
AND THEN
I COULD'VE LOGGED OUT‐‐

153
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,577
Kyoko: I TRIED
THAT APPROACH BEFORE.

154
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,455
IT TOOK YOU FIVE MINUTES
TO SNAP OUT OF IT, REMEMBER?

155
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,957
Asuna: WELL, YEAH.

156
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,501
I HAD TO SAY GOOD‐BYE
TO EVERYONE BEFORE I LOG‐‐

157
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,919
Kyoko: OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

158
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,921
WHAT YOU DO
IN SOME STUPID VIRTUAL GAME

159
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,297
DOES NOT TAKE PRIORITY

160
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,426
OVER YOUR COMMITMENTS
IN THE REAL WORLD, EVER.

161
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,305
Asuna: I'M SORRY.

162
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,226
I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME.

163
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,603
Kyoko: THIS WILL BE
YOUR LAST WARNING.

164
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,149
IF YOU BREAK YOUR WORD TO ME
BECAUSE OF THAT THING AGAIN,

165
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,734
I'M CONFISCATING IT.

166
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,611
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THAT HEAD OF YOURS.

167
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,947
YOU LOST TWO YEARS OF YOUR LIFE

168
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,241
BECAUSE OF THAT‐‐
THAT INFERNAL MACHINE.

169
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,409
YOU COULD'VE DIED.

170
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,038
HOW CAN YOU EVEN STAND
TO LOOK AT IT?

I'M NOT MUCH GOOD AS A TANK.

IN OUR WAY OR TRY TO STOP US,

LIKE THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS

COMES ALONG TO TAKE ON A BOSS,

300

DIDN'T FOLLOW US,

SO IF THEY CAN'T SEE US

306

HOW ARE THEY GONNA GATHER
ANY INTEL ON IT?

THEY COULD SEE US FIGHT.

308

I LOOKED OVER,

00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,898

NEAR JUN'S FEET.

310
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,650
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
I LET MY GUARD DOWN TOO SOON.

311
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,153
IT'S A DARK SPELL
CALLED PEEPING.

312
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,113
IT BINDS A FAMILIAR TO A PLAYER,

313
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,324
AND THE CASTER SEES
WHAT IT SEES.

314
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,829
Yuuki: SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS AFTER WE GOT HAMMERED

315
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,498
BY THE BOSSES
ON FLOORS TWENTY‐FIVE AND ‐SIX,

316
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,043
THAT OTHER GUILD
SWOOPING IN AND BEATING 'EM,

317
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,003
THAT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE?

318
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,755
Asuna: NO, I'M AFRAID IT WASN'T.

319
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,298
YOU PROBABLY FOUGHT SO HARD,

320
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,467
THE BOSS USED
EVERY MOVE IT HAD AGAINST YOU,

321
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,885
AND THEY SAW IT ALL.

322
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,887
THAT'S HOW THEY BEAT
THE BOSSES SO QUICKLY.

323
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,474
Siune: THEY USED US AGAIN.

324
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,310
NOW THEY KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS BOSS, TOO.

325
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,064
THEY'RE PROBABLY IN THERE

329
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,820
DON'T COUNT US OUT JUST YET.

330
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,323
Yuuki: BUT WHAT CAN WE DO
ABOUT IT NOW?

331
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,117
Asuna: SIMPLE. IT'S 2:30 P.M.
IN THE REAL WORLD.

332
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,162
AT THIS TIME OF DAY
AND ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE,

333
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,332
IT'LL BE HARD TO FIND
ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR A RAID PARTY.

334
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,543
BY MY ESTIMATE, IT SHOULD
TAKE THEM AT LEAST AN HOUR.

335
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,462
THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME FOR US.

336
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,923
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.
AFTER THIS,

337
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,300
IF WE CAN GET BACK TO THAT ROOM
IN THIRTY MINUTES,

338
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,301
WE CAN TAKE IT.

339
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,886

Asuna: DON'T WORRY.

350
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,127
THEY WON'T ADVANCE
WITH ONLY TWENTY PLAYERS.

351
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,671
WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO GIVE IT ONE MORE TRY

352
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:09,922
BEFORE THE REST SHOW UP.

WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

361
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,689
Player 3: IT MEANS,
IN A COUPLE MINUTES,

362
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,858
THE REST OF THE GUILD'S
GONNA ROLL UP HERE.

00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,820
IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN WAIT OVER THERE.

DO YOU EXPECT US TO WAIT?

Asuna: BUT WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF TIME!

369
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,123
IF YOU WERE GOING IN RIGHT NOW,
WELL, THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY,

Asuna: ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT'S FAR AWAY!

00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,725
IT'D TAKE US AT LEAST
AN HOUR TO GET THERE!

379
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,310
Yuuki: HEY, BIG GUY.

380

00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,771
THEY LOOK LIKE
THE SERIOUS TYPES.

401
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,836
WE COULD CHOP AWAY ALL DAY,

402
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:54,506
AND THEY'D DEFEND THIS ROOM
TO THE LAST PLAYER.

403
