‐ ON THIS ISLAND ON FLOOR 24.

00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,601
Asuna: THEN I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
THERE TOMORROW AT 2:30.

00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:18,810
‐ Leafa: OKAY.
‐ Lisbeth: YOU GOT IT.

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,811
Silica: I CAN'T WAIT.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,355
THIS'LL BE SO MUCH FUN.

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,524
‐ Leafa: YEAH, IT WILL.
‐ Lisbeth: HUH. YEAH!

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,442
THE BERSERK HEALER'S
GONNA GET UNLEASHED.

00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,777
Asuna: OH?

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,905
Yui: DADDY, YOU HAVE
SOMETHING ON YOUR FACE.

11
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,240
Kirito: HUH? FOR REAL?

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,242
Yui: YES. IT'S COVERED IN INK.

00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,662
Asuna: SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW.

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,705

00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,694
GOOD NIGHT, MS. SADA.

22
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,487
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

23
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,156
I'M SORRY
YOU HAD TO WORK SO LATE.

24
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,493
Sada: (SIGHS)
NOT AT ALL, REALLY.

25
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,620
JUST DOING MY JOB, MISS.

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,041
Asuna: DO YOU KNOW IF MY MOTHER
AND BROTHER ARE HOME YET?

27
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,418
Sada: KOICHIRO PHONED TO SAY

28
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,378
HE WON'T BE IN
TILL LATE TONIGHT,

29
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,047
AND YOUR MOTHER
IS WAITING IN THE DINING ROOM.

30
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,341
Asuna: OH. THANK YOU.

31
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,427
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, MS. SADA.

00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,086
NEXT TIME, I WANT YOU HERE
FIVE MINUTES EARLY

00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,921

00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,107
IT LOOKS GOOD.

40
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,253
Kyoko: I ASSUME YOU WERE
USING THAT THING AGAIN?

41
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,713
Asuna: YES.

42
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,591
MY FRIENDS AND I WERE
DOING OUR HOMEWORK TOGETHER.

43
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,928
UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY
PHYSICALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK,

44
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,596
YOU WON'T LEARN A THING.

45
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,432
Asuna: BUT WE ALL LIVE
SO FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

46
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,518
IT'S MORE CONVENIENT
FOR US TO MEET IN‐GAME.

47
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,353
Kyoko: IT HARDLY
QUALIFIES AS MEETING

48
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,896
IF YOU'RE USING THAT TOY.

49
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,690
BESIDES, DOING YOUR HOMEWORK
IS NOT A TEAM ACTIVITY.

50
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,401
IF YOU'RE WITH YOUR FRIENDS,
YOU'LL JUST FOOL AROUND.

51
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,366
ASUNA, YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY AROUND ANYMORE.

52
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,451
YOU'RE TWO YEARS
BEHIND EVERYONE ELSE.

53
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,912
YOU SHOULD BE STUDYING
AS HARD AS YOU CAN

54
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,164
TO MAKE UP
FOR ALL THAT LOST TIME.

55
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,958
Asuna: BUT I AM STUDYING HARD.

56
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,877
DIDN'T YOU SEE MY GRADES
FOR THE SECOND SEMESTER?

57
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,587
I LEFT THEM ON YOUR DESK.

58
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,172
Kyoko: YES, I SAW THEM,

59
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:43,176
BUT GRADES FROM A SCHOOL
LIKE THAT ARE SUSPECT, AT BEST.

60
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,136
Asuna: THEY'RE NOT SUSPECT.

61
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,056
Kyoko: YES, WELL,
FOR YOUR NEXT TRIMESTER,

62
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,392
I'VE DECIDED
TO HIRE YOU A TUTOR,

63
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,353
AND NOT ONE OF THOSE VIRTUAL
ONES EVERYONE'S GOING ON ABOUT,

64
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,938
SOMEONE WHO'LL COME
TO THE HOUSE.

65
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,774
Asuna: BUT DON'T I GET
TO HAVE ANY SAY IN IT?

66
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,818
Kyoko: HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

67
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,616
Asuna: A TRANSFER EXAM
STUDY GUIDE?

68
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,578
Kyoko: I KNOW SOMEONE
ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THERE.

69
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,829
AFTER SOME DISCUSSION,

70
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,998
I CONVINCED THEM
TO LET YOU TAKE AN EXAM

71
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,708
TO TRANSFER
INTO THEIR SENIOR CLASS.

72
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:19,170
IT'S A PROPER HIGH SCHOOL,
NOT SOME MAKESHIFT STUDY HALL.

73
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,505
AND SINCE IT'S CREDIT‐BASED,

74
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,841
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
ABLE TO GRADUATE

75
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,342
AFTER THE FIRST TRIMESTER.

76
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,220
IF YOU DO, YOU'LL BE
BACK ON TRACK FOR COLLEGE.

77
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,805
Asuna: WAIT! HOLD ON!

78
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,182
YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE A DECISION
LIKE THIS WITHOUT ME!

79
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,602
I‐I HAPPEN TO LIKE
THE SCHOOL I'M IN.

80
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,103
THE TEACHERS THERE ARE GREAT.

81
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,814
I‐I CAN LEARN THERE
JUST AS MUCH AS ANYWHERE!

82
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,524
I DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE SCHOOLS!

83
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,484
Kyoko: (SIGHS)

84
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,531
I'VE DONE MY RESEARCH,
YOU KNOW, AND BELIEVE ME,

85
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,868
THAT PLACE YOU'RE ATTENDING
CAN HARDLY BE CALLED A SCHOOL.

86
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,288
THE CURRICULUM IS SLAPDASH,
AND THE CLASSES ARE A JOKE.

87
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,165
EVEN THE FACULTY'S SUBSTANDARD.

88
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,833
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF LOSERS

89
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,710
WITH NO REAL CREDENTIALS
TO SPEAK OF.

90
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,836
Asuna: (GASPS)

91
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,671
DON'T SAY THAT.

92
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,135
Kyoko: THEY CLAIM
THEY'RE HELPING THE STUDENTS

93
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,137
WHO FELL BEHIND
BECAUSE OF THAT ACCIDENT.

94
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,057
IT'S ALL A LIE.
THEY JUST WANT ALL THE CHILDREN

95
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,684
WHO'VE SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS
KILLING EACH OTHER

96
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,437
IN ONE CONVENIENT PLACE
SO THEY CAN MONITOR THEM.

97
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,939
IT'S MORE LIKE AN ASYLUM
THAN A SCHOOL.

98
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,152
Asuna: DID YOU FORGET, MOTHER?

99
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,905
I SPENT TWO YEARS
KILLING OTHER KIDS, TOO.

100
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,574
(GASPS)

101
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,327
Kyoko: ALL THE FRIENDS
YOU HAD BACK IN JUNIOR HIGH

102
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,663
ARE STUDYING TO GET
INTO COLLEGE THIS YEAR.

103
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,039
THEY'RE LEAVING YOU BEHIND.

104
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,957
DOESN'T THAT BOTHER YOU?

105
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,669
Asuna: NOT AT ALL. IF IT TAKES
AN EXTRA YEAR OR TWO,

106
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,171
IT WON'T MAKE MUCH
OF A DIFFERENCE.

107
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,091
BESIDES, I MIGHT NOT WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

108
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,385
Kyoko: RIDICULOUS.
I WON'T ENTERTAIN SUCH TALK.

109
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,304
YOU'RE FAR TOO GIFTED,
AND YOUR FATHER AND I

110
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,807
HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS
TO NURTURE YOUR TALENTS.

111
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,684
I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THAT.

112
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,978
Asuna: I DO, BUT SHOULDN'T I GET
TO HAVE A SAY IN MY OWN FUTURE?

113
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,898
SURE, I MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT KIND
OF CAREER I WANT RIGHT NOW,

114
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,274
BUT I'M CLOSE TO FINDING OUT.

115
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,860
IF I STAY IN MY SCHOOL
FOR ANOTHER YEAR,

116
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,862
IT WILL HELP ME MAKE
THAT DECISION.

117
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,364
Kyoko: (SIGHS)

118
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,492
NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU STAY
AT A PLACE LIKE THAT,

119
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,952
IT'LL JUST LIMIT YOUR OPTIONS.

120
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,286
LOOK, TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

121
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,831
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE A WRONG TURN NOW

122
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,998
AND REGRET IT LATER.

123
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,084
I JUST WANT YOU
TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE

124
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,795
AND FIND YOURSELF A GOOD CAREER
YOU CAN BE PROUD OF.

125
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,424
Asuna: SO THAT BOY YOU FORCED ME
TO MEET ON NEW YEAR'S DAY,

126
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,009
THAT WAS YOU TRYING
TO HELP ME WITH MY CAREER?

127
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,636
YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD HIM.

128
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,972
HE WAS TALKING LIKE WE WERE
ALREADY ENGAGED OR SOMETHING.

129
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,391
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S LIMITING MY OPTIONS,

130
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,435
NOT ME AND NOT MY SCHOOL!

131
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,399
MARRIAGE IS PART OF YOUR CAREER.

132
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,944
IF YOU MARRY BENEATH YOU
OR MARRY POOR,

133
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,404
I GUARANTEE YOU'LL REGRET IT.

134
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,531
YOU WON'T HAVE
THE MEANS TO PURSUE

135
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,366
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU REALLY WANT TO DO.

136
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,370
THAT'S WHY I THINK YUUYA
WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.

137
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,706
HIS FAMILY OWNS
A SMALL REGIONAL BANK.

138
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,124
THOSE ARE MUCH MORE STABLE

139
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,335
THAN SOME MEGA‐BANK
RUN BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

140
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,008
Asuna: YOUR LAST CHOICE
WASN'T VERY GOOD.

141
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,177
DID YOU FORGET HOW HE MADE ME

142
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,095
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY OTHERS SUFFER?

143
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,724
NOBUYUKI SUGOU
NEARLY BANKRUPTED RECT.

144
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,768
HE WAS YOUR CHOICE, MOTHER.

145
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,311
Kyoko: ENOUGH, YOUNG LADY!

146
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,147
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT HIM IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN.

147
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,483
AND YOU'RE WRONG.
IT WASN'T MY CHOICE.

148
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,942
IT WAS YOUR FATHER'S.

149
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,445
HE SUGGESTED THAT CROOK
MARRY INTO THIS FAMILY.

150
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,947
HE'S NEVER BEEN
A GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

151
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,365
BUT DON'T WORRY.

152
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,826
YUUYA MIGHT LACK INITIATIVE,
BUT HE SEEMS STABLE,

153
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,537
AND STABILITY IS
THE CORNERSTONE OF MARRIAGE.

154
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,872
Asuna: I DON'T CARE.

155
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,041
I HAVE NO INTENTION
TO DATE OR MARRY HIM.

156
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,626
I CHOOSE WHO I'LL MARRY.

157
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,504
Kyoko: FINE.
AS LONG AS THE MAN YOU CHOOSE

158
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,465
IS FROM A GOOD FAMILY
AND IS WORTHY OF YOU.

159
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,300
HOWEVER, A BOY LIKE THAT,

160
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,512
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND FROM SCHOOL,
IS NOT WORTHY.

161
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,972
Asuna: (GASPS)

162
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,559
Y‐YOU HAD HIM INVESTIGATED?

163
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,020
Kyoko: OF COURSE I DID.
TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

164
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,815
YOUR FATHER AND I ONLY WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU IN LIFE.

165
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,400
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL
TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT

166
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,778
AS LONG AS YOU MAKE
THE RIGHT CHOICES.

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,828
Asuna: I NEED TIME
TO THINK ABOUT TRANSFERRING.

168
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,288
Kyoko: KEEP IN MIND
THE DEADLINE'S NEXT WEEK.

169
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,748
DON'T FORGET.

174

Asuna: EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE GONE,

175
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,847
YOU'RE STILL ASHAMED OF GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA, AREN'T YOU?

176
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,183
YOU'RE ANGRY YOU WEREN'T BORN

HEY, ABOUT THAT QUESTIONNAIRE,

183
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,920
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHAT YOU WANNA DO YET?

184
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,006
Kirito: I GUESS, IF ANYTHING,

185
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,425
I WANNA GO FROM PLAYING GAMES
TO BEING A CREATOR.

186

Asuna: A CREATOR?
WHAT, FOR GAMES?

187
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,846
Kirito: NO, NOT FOR GAMES.

188
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,764
I WANNA MAKE
A HUMAN‐MACHINE INTERFACE

189
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,641
TO REPLACE
THE FULL‐DIVE TECH WE USE NOW.

190
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,560
I'VE BEEN GOING
TO ALL THESE TECH FORUMS

191

TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT,

192
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,148
BUT IT'S A HECK OF A LOT
OF INFORMATION TO ABSORB.

193
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:36,154
Asuna: I WANT TO BE WITH KIRITO
AND GO AFTER THE SAME DREAM,

194
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,197
BUT NOW...

195
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,116
Kirito: YOU SURE ARE STRONG,

196
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,202
WAY STRONGER THAN I AM.

197
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,913

SO PUNCTUAL, DON'T YA THINK?

206
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,036

YOU KNOW, THAT ONE DAY YOU

213
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,318
AND I MADE YOU DINNER?

214
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,820
Kirito: HATE TO SAY IT,

00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,030
BUT MY MEMORY'S ABOUT AS GOOD
AS MY PUNCTUALITY.

THAT'S THE DAY I GOT
A SUPER‐RARE FOOD ITEM, RIGHT?

221
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,585

AN AWESOME STEW OUT OF IT.

OH, BY THE WAY,

241

LEAFA SAID IN THE MIDDLE
OF YOUR DUEL WITH ZEKKEN,

242
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,127
YOU STOPPED FIGHTING TO TALK.

243
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,462
WHAT'D YOU TALK ABOUT?

244
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,423
Kirito: WELL, ACTUALLY,
I ASKED A QUESTION.

245
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,466
Asuna: WHAT ABOUT?

246
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,471
Kirito: I GOT A WEIRD VIBE,
SO I ASKED...

247
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,557
YOU'RE FULL‐TIME IN THIS WORLD,
AREN'T YOU, ZEKKEN?

248
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,226
AND THEN, FOR AN ANSWER,

249
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,854
I GOT A SLY GRIN
AND A MEGA‐FAST ATTACK.

250
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,733
I'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
MOVE THAT FAST.

251
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,070
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY
"FULL TIME IN THIS WORLD"?

252
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,448
IS THAT THE SAME THING
AS BEING A HEAVY USER?

253
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,492
Kirito: UH‐UH.
ZEKKEN'S WAY DIFFERENT

254
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,619
THAN YOUR AVERAGE,
EVERYDAY HARDCORE GAMER.

255
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,914

WERE A SORT OF PRODUCT

WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

258
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,005
Kirito: IN A WAY,
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER YOU DON'T.

259
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,842
