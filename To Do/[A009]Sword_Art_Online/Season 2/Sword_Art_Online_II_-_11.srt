1
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,350
Sinon: SO DEATH GUN
WAS IN LAUGHING COFFIN,

2
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,435
AND YOU GUYS FOUGHT BEFORE.

3
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:27,027
KIRITO,
I NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING.

4
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,071
IT'S ABOUT
THE PEOPLE YOU KILLED.

5
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,531
HOW DID YOU GET OVER
WHAT YOU DID?

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,659
HOW ARE YOU
NOT AFFECTED BY IT?

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,620
HOW ARE YOU SO STRONG,
YOU'RE NOT CONTROLLED BY IT?

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,168
Kirito: I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN OVER IT.

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,003
Sinon: WHAT?

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,298
Kirito: LAST NIGHT,
I KEPT HAVING NIGHTMARES

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,509
ABOUT THE THREE GUYS I KILLED.

12
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,386
I HARDLY SLEPT AT ALL.

13
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,056
I SAW THEIR FACES
RIGHT BEFORE THEY VANISHED.

14
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,308
I HEARD THEIR VOICES,

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,477
THEIR WORDS.

16
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,397
I DON'T THINK
I'M EVER GONNA FORGET 'EM.

17
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,690
Sinon: (GASPS)

18
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,900
BUT THEN...

19
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,111
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

20
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,446
I‐‐I CAN'T...

21
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,074
Kirito: IT'S OKAY.

22
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,578
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY
HOW IT SHOULD BE.

23
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,079
I GET IT NOW.

24
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,081
THERE ARE THINGS
I SHOULDN'T FORGET,

25
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,874
WHAT IT MEANS TO KILL,

26
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,002
THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF TAKING A LIFE.

27
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,129
AND ONCE I ACCEPT IT,

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,132
MAYBE THEN I'LL BE ABLE
TO FIND SOME CLOSURE.

29
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,092
THAT'S HOW I SEE IT.

30
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,511
Sinon: CLOSURE...

31
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,096
BY ACCEPTING IT?

32
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,056
(SIGHS)

33
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,327
(WIND BLOWING)

34
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,750
Sinon: DEATH GUN.

35
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:29,709
Kirito: HMM?

36
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,211
Sinon: IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

37
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,630
THAT UNDER THAT CLOAK,
THERE'S A REAL‐LIVE PERSON

38
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,298
WHO JUST WANTS TO KILL.

39
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,550
Kirito: YEAH.

40
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,885
AND IF I KNEW
HIS HANDLE IN "S. A. O.,"

41
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,470
I'D BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

42
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,597
HIS NAME AND ADDRESS
IN THE REAL WORLD.

43
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,893
THAT'S THE REASON
WHY I LOGGED INTO "G. G. O."

44
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,020
Sinon: OH.

45
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,273
THEN MAYBE
HIS REASON FOR BEING HERE

46
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,693
IS 'CAUSE HE LIKES TO P.K.
MAYBE HE MISSES THE RUSH

47
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,028
OF DOING IT FROM "S. A. O."
YOU THINK?

48
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,698
Kirito: NAH,
THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

49
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,283
HE KILLED ZXE‐D AND TARAKO

50
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,535
IN FRONT
OF A BUNCH OF WITNESSES.

51
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,996
IT WAS THE SAME WITH PALE RIDER.

52
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:10,000
HE ALWAYS PICKS TIMES WHEN HE'S
GOT THE BIGGEST AUDIENCE.

53
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,461
AND THAT SIGN OF THE CROSS
HE MAKES,

54
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,465
I BET HE DOES IT TO FREAK OUT
AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

55
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,008
HE WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE

56
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,385
HE'S GOT THE POWER TO KILL YOU
FROM IN THE GAME,

57
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,470
BUT IT'S ALL A SHOW.

58
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,512
Sinon: IF THAT'S TRUE,

59
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,347
THEN HOW'S HE KILLING PEOPLE?

60
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,600
Kirito: IT'S NOT
'CAUSE OF BRAIN DAMAGE

61
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,518
FROM THEIR HEADGEAR.
THE AUTHORITIES SAID

62
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,188
THAT ZXE‐D AND TARAKO
DIED OF HEART FAILURE.

63
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,065
Sinon: HEART FAILURE?

64
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,067
MY GOD.

65
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,736
Kirito: TO BE HONEST,

66
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,322
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HE KILLED 'EM EITHER.

67
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,450
BUT THE THOUGHT OF FIRING
A GUN IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD

68
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,077
AND STOPPING A PLAYER'S HEART,

69
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,121
THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S POSSIBLE.

70
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,956
HANG ON A SECOND.

71
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,625
COME TO THINK OF IT...

72
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,751
Sinon: WHAT?

73
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,127
Kirito: THAT WAS WEIRD.

74
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,212
Sinon: WHAT WAS?

75
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,297
Kirito: BACK THERE IN THE RUINS,

76
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,299
HE HAD HIS HANDGUN OUT FOR YOU,

77
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,635
BUT HE SWITCHED
TO THE RIFLE FOR ME,

78
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,261
BUT HE KILLS WITH THE HANDGUN.

79
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:08,099
HE COULD HAVE KILLED ME WITH IT,
SO WHY'D HE SWITCH?

80
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,601
Sinon: YEAH. GOOD QUESTION.

81
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,112
Kirito: COULD IT BE
THAT HE DIDN'T SHOOT ME WITH IT

82
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,114
'CAUSE HE COULDN'T
SHOOT ME WITH IT?

83
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,867
THE HANDGUN,

84
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,911
CAN'T USE IT, THOUGH.

85
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,705
THE SWITCH.
THE CROSSING HIMSELF THING.

86
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,374
INVISIBILITY CLOAK.

87
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,000
CONDITIONS, RULES.

88
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,670
Kikuoka: HERE.
I CAN'T TELL YOU

89
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,589
HOW RELIEVED I AM
TO HEAR YOU PUT IT INTO WORDS.

90
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,007
Kirito: KNEW IT.

91
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,886
IN‐GAME GUNS CAN'T KILL I. R. L.

92
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,889
SHOOTING SOMEONE
FROM IN HERE'S NOT WHAT DOES IT.

93
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,057
IT TAKES PREPARATION.

94
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,433
Sinon: NOW YOU LOST ME.

95
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,727
Kirito: THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE IT LOOK

96
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,312
LIKE HE'S KILLING PEOPLE IN‐GAME

97
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,774
IS BY SETTING UP FOR THE MURDER
IN THE REAL WORLD FIRST.

98
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,277
Sinon: HOW WOULD HE
SET SOMETHING LIKE THAT UP?

99
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,153
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE RIGHT,

100
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,490
HE'D HAVE TO GET A PLAYER'S
REAL‐LIFE INFORMATION TO DO IT.

101
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,409
ALL THAT STUFF'S SECURE, THOUGH.

102
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,371
Kirito: NO.
IF SOMEONE'S CLEVER ENOUGH,

103
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,665
THEY CAN FIND OUT
A PLAYER'S ADDRESS EASY.

104
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,292
Sinon: HOW?

105
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,378
Kirito: THE TERMINALS
AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

106
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,007
YOU HAVE TO PLUG YOUR REAL NAME
AND ADDRESS INTO 'EM TO COMPETE.

107
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,508
IT'S AN OPEN SPACE.

108
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,219
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY PRIVACY THERE.

109
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,139
Sinon: NO WAY. YOU SAYING
HE PEEKED OVER THEIR SHOULDERS

110
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,766
WHILE THEY ENTERED THEIR INFO?
THAT CAN'T BE IT,

111
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,060
'CAUSE YOU'D NOTICE
SOMEONE LURKING NEXT TO YOU.

112
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,979
Kirito: HE COULD HAVE
USED A SCOPE

113
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,939
OR SOME BINOCULARS
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

114
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,482
Sinon: THAT'S
BREAKING ETIQUETTE.

115
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,319
HE'D GET HIS ASS
KICKED OUT OF THE GAME FOR THAT.

116
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,239
Kirito: THEN HOW 'BOUT THIS?

117
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,909
MAYBE DEATH GUN CAN,
LIKE, USE HIS CLOAK

118
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,785
TO TURN INVISIBLE IN TOWN, TOO.

119
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,913
Sinon: HE'D BE RIGHT THERE,

120
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,790
AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

121
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,960
BUT STILL, HE CAN'T
DO ANYTHING IN THE REAL WORLD.

122
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,630
WHEN HE'S LOGGED IN HERE,
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS THERE.

123
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,672
Kirito: RIGHT.

124
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,885
(GASPS)

125
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,970
WAIT.

126
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,222
THAT'S IT. YEAH.

127
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,058
IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

128
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,392
DEATH GUN...

129
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,769
HAS A PARTNER!

130
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,313
CHECK IT OUT.

131
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,107
ONE OF THEM PLAYS
AS THE DEATH GUN AVATAR.

132
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,068
HIS JOB IS TO SHOOT THE TARGET.

133
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,445
AT THE SAME TIME,
IN THE REAL WORLD,

134
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,489
THE SECOND PERSON
IN THE TARGET'S APARTMENT.

135
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,699
HIS JOB IS TAKE THE PLAYER OUT.

136
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,825
Sinon: (GASPS)

137
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,164
OKAY, BUT LET'S SAY
THEY FOUND OUT YOUR ADDRESS.

138
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,375
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PEOPLE
LIVING THERE?

139
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,876
AND THEY'D NEED A KEY.

140
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,337
Kirito: AS FAR
AS ZXE‐D AND TARAKO GO,

141
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,880
THEY LIVED ALONE,

142
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,092
AND THEIR APARTMENTS
WERE IN OLDER BUILDINGS.

143
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,761
THE E‐LOCKS ON THEIR DOORS
WERE PROBABLY FIRST‐GEN,

144
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,471
NOT VERY SECURE.

145
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:55,308
BESIDES, THEY WERE BOTH DIVING
IN "G. G. O." DURING THE BREAK‐IN,

146
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,977
SO THEY WERE BOTH UNCONSCIOUS
AND COMPLETELY HELPLESS.

147
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,562
THEY COULDN'T HEAR,

148
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,774
SO THE KILLER COULD
TAKE HIS TIME GETTING IN.

149
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,484
Sinon: BUT THEN YOU SAID

150
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,112
THE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR BOTH
WAS HEART FAILURE, RIGHT?

151
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,863
SO HOW'D THEY
STOP SOMEONE'S HEART

152
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,991
IN A WAY BOTH THE COPS AND
THE CORONER COULDN'T FIGURE OUT?

153
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,078
Kirito: MAYBE BY INJECTING
SOME KIND OF DRUG OR SOMETHING.

154
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,079
THAT'S ONE WAY.

155
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,539
Sinon: OKAY, BUT SOMEONE

156
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,541
SHOULD HAVE FOUND
EVIDENCE OF IT,

157
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,000
A MARK OR SOMETHING.

158
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,003
Kirito: THEY DIDN'T
FIND THE BODIES FOR A WHILE,

159
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,755
SO THEY WERE PRETTY DECOMPOSED.

160
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,257
BESIDES, A HARD‐CORE GAMER

161
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,926
CAN GO FOR DAYS
WITHOUT EATING OR SLEEPING.

162
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,178
I DOUBT ANYONE
WOULD THINK IT'S WEIRD

163
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,432
IF SOMEONE DIED
OF A HEART ATTACK AFTER THAT.

164
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,308
Sinon: THEY'RE CRAZY.

165
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,477
RIGHT?

166
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,896
I MEAN, WHY ELSE
WOULD ANYONE DO THIS?

167
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,275
Kirito: MAYBE,
OR MAYBE THEY DO IT

168
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,903
'CAUSE RED PLAYERS
ARE WHO THEY REALLY ARE.

169
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,282
I MEAN, DEEP DOWN,
I THINK I'M REALLY A SWORDSMAN.

170
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:56,202
Sinon: WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,
I CAN SORT OF UNDERSTAND.

171
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:01,666
THERE'S TIMES WHEN I THINK
I'M A REAL SNIPER, NOT A GAMER.

172
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,752
WAIT. DO YOU THINK

173
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,755
THE GUY DOING THE KILLING'S
A RED PLAYER, TOO,

174
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,631
YOU KNOW, LIKE DEATH GUN?

175
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,093
Kirito: YEAH. THEY WERE PROBABLY
IN LAUGHING COFFIN TOGETHER.

176
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,305
I'M STILL WONDERING HOW THEY
COORDINATED THE KILLINGS

177
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,640
BETWEEN THIS WORLD
AND THE REAL ONE.

178
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,060
HOW ARE THEY
SO PRECISE ABOUT IT?

179
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,561
‐ YEAH.
‐ Sinon: (GASPS)

180
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,104
Kirito: THAT'S IT.

181
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,815
THAT'S WHAT DOING
THE SIGN OF THE CROSS IS ABOUT.

182
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,609
IT'S NOT JUST FOR SHOW.

183
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,738
IT'S ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO SNEAK A PEEK AT HIS WATCH.

184
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,615
Sinon: YOU'RE RIGHT.

185
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,078
(GASPS)

186
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,246
Kirito: SINON...

187
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,581
DO YOU LIVE ALONE?

188
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,416
Sinon: UM, YEAH.

189
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,752
BUT I'M SURE I LOCKED MY DOOR.

190
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,838
MY BUILDING'S
GOT FIRST‐GEN LOCKS,

191
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,508
BUT I'VE ALSO GOT A CHAIN.

192
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,675
(GASPS)

193
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,345
I THINK I LEFT
THE CHAIN OFF TONIGHT.

194
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,097
Kirito: OH, MAN.

195
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,684
LISTEN,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE THIS.

196
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,232
WHEN DEATH GUN
WAS CHASING US ON THAT HORSE,

197
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,567
I WASN'T THE ONE
HE WAS SHOOTING AT.

198
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,111
AND THAT COULD ONLY MEAN

199
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,947
THEY GOT THEIR NEXT VICTIM
ALL SET UP AND READY TO GO.

200
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,698
Sinon: OKAY.

201
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,534
THEN WHO'S NEXT?

202
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,704
Kirito: I GOT A FEELING THAT
RIGHT NOW IN THE REAL WORLD,

203
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,207
DEATH GUN'S PARTNER'S
IN YOUR PLACE.

204
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,875
HE'S WATCHING THE LIVE STREAM,

205
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,628
WAITING FOR WHEN YOU
GET SHOT BY THAT GUN.

206
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,255
IT'S JUST A HUNCH.

207
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,842
(LIZARD SQUEALS)

208
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,129
Sinon: NO.

209
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,590
NO. NO, NOT THAT.

210
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,342
OH, GOD. (GASPING)

211
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,096
(HEART BEATING)

212
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,774
Kirito: CALM DOWN.

213
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,985
IF YOU LOG OUT NOW,
YOU'LL BE IN DANGER.

214
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,904
JUST CALM DOWN.

215
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,697
GO EASY.

216
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,200
(HEARTBEAT SLOWING)

217
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,334
UNTIL DEATH GUN SHOOTS YOU,

218
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,795
THE GUY IN YOUR PLACE
ISN'T GONNA DO ANYTHING, OKAY?

219
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,465
THAT'S THE RULE
THEY SET UP FOR THEMSELVES.

220
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,802
BUT IF YOU LOG OUT NOW AND
WAKE UP WITH HIS PARTNER THERE,

221
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,139
HE'LL KILL YOU,
SO YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN.

222
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,266
Sinon: BUT‐‐BUT...

223
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,894
I'M SCARED. I'M SO SCARED.

224
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,734
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

225
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,777
All: HMM?

226
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,406
Lisbeth: JEEZ, CHRYSHEIGHT,

227
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,867
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

228
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,286
Kikuoka: SORRY, GUYS.
I BOOKED IT OVER HERE

229
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,705
AS FAST AS I COULD
FROM MY SAVE POINT.

230
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,749
IF THERE WERE
A SPEED LIMIT IN "A. L. O.,"

231
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,710
MY LICENSE WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN SUSPENDED.

232
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,753
HUH?

233
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,007
Asuna: WHAT IS GOING ON?

234
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,137
Kikuoka: (CLEARS THROAT)

235
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,139
I'D BE HAPPY
TO EXPLAIN IN DETAIL,

236
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,017
BUT I SHOULD WARN YOU
IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE.

237
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,104
TO TELL THE TRUTH, I'M NOT
100% SURE WHERE TO BEGIN.

238
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,230
Asuna: OH, DON'T EVEN.

239
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,439
Yui: NOT TO WORRY.

240
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,566
I KNOW JUST WHERE TO START.

241
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,278
ON NOVEMBER 9,
IN "GUN GALE ONLINE,"

242
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,863
A PLAYER CALLED DEATH GUN
FIRED HIS WEAPON

243
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,949
AT AN AVATAR
APPEARING ON A MONITOR.

244
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,244
THAT SAME DAY IN NAKANO WARD,

245
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,080
THE PLAYER OF THAT AVATAR
MYSTERIOUSLY DIED.

246
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,879
Kikuoka: YOUNG LADY,
THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

247
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,799
GATHERING ALL THAT INFORMATION
AND CONNECTING IT SO QUICKLY,

248
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,634
YOU MUST BE
QUITE THE RESEARCHER.

249
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,804
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
A CAREER IN THE V. R. SECTION?

250
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,472
‐ Asuna: (GROANS)
‐ Kikuoka: WHOA. YOU WIN.

251
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,475
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT GOING
TO STONEWALL YOU, PROMISE.

252
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,477
JUST COMPLIMENTING HER, IS ALL.

253
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,230
SHE'S RIGHT, THOUGH. IT'S TRUE.

254
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,898
Klein: YO,
CHRYSHEIGHT OR WHATEVER,

255
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,817
I HEAR YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT HIRED KIRITO

256
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,402
TO DIVE INTO THAT GAME.

257
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,238
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU GOT HIM TO CONVERT OVER

258
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,282
KNOWING A PLAYER
GOT SHOT IN‐GAME

259
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,825
AND DIED I. R. L. BECAUSE OF IT?

260
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,577
Kikuoka: EASY, KLEIN.
I CAN EXPLAIN.

261
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,328
THAT'S NOT HOW THE PLAYER DIED.

262
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,039
Klein: THEN HOW?

263
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,249
Kikuoka: IT'S NOT
THE AMUSPHERE RIG.

264
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,461
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU
IN‐GAME, IT CAN'T HURT YOU,

265
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,588
AND IT CERTAINLY
CAN'T STOP A PLAYER'S HEART

266
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,590
WHEN IT'S NOT EVEN
DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO IT.

267
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,342
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
KIRITO AND I MET LAST WEEK

268
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,095
TO TALK ABOUT IT AND PRETTY MUCH
AGREED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

269
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,307
THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE
CAN KILL A PERSON IN REAL LIFE

270
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,059
BY SHOOTING THEM IN THE GAME.

271
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,064
Leafa: OKAY, THEN,
IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE,

272
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,400
HOW COME YOU HAD MY BROTHER
DIVE INTO "G. G. O." FOR YOU, HUH?

273
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,736
YOU HAD A HUNCH
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

274
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,862
SCRATCH THAT.

275
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,739
YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG.

276
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,616
THAT DEATH GUN GUY'S
A PART OF IT,

277
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,744
AND I BET YOU SENT MY BROTHER IN
TO TRY TO FIND HIM.

278
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,705
Asuna: CHRYSHEIGHT,

279
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,207
WE FIGURED IT OUT.

280
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,168
DEATH GUN IS AN "S. A. O."
SURVIVOR JUST LIKE US,

281
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,629
BUT UNLIKE US,
HE WAS A RED PLAYER

282
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,298
WHO WAS IN A GUILD OF KILLERS
CALLED LAUGHING COFFIN.

283
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,759
Kikuoka: YOU SURE
HE WAS WITH THEM?

284
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,012
Asuna: YES. NONE OF US
CAN REMEMBER HIS NAME, THOUGH.

285
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,931
KLEIN AND I MET HIM ONCE

286
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,225
WHEN OUR GROUP
WENT TO CAPTURE HIS.

287
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,103
Lisbeth: UM, HEY, ASUNA,
I GET THE FEELING

288
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,438
CHRYSHEIGHT KNOWS MORE
THAN HE'S LETTING ON.

289
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,524
NO OFFENSE, CHRYSHEIGHT,
BUT ALL WE KNOW

290
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,527
IS YOU WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT
DOING SOMETHING WITH NETWORKS

291
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,278
AND THAT YOU PLAY "A. L. O."

292
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,949
AS PART OF SOME KIND OF RESEARCH
YOU'RE DOING ON V. R. M. M. O. s.

293
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,951
Kikuoka: ONLY FOR THE PAST YEAR.

294
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,620
THE JOB I HAD BEFORE
WAS A LITTLE...

295
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,788
DIFFERENT.

296
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,582
I USED TO BE PART
OF THE TASK FORCE

297
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,917
FOR THE "S. A. O." INCIDENT.

298
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,462
BUT EVEN THOUGH
WE WERE CALLED A TASK FORCE,

299
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,798
IN THE END,
WE WERE PRETTY INEFFECTIVE.

300
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,176
Asuna: CHRYSHEIGHT,
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY WELL CONNECTED,

301
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,428
AND WITH A LITTLE DIGGING,
YOU COULD FIND OUT

302
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,181
WHAT THE REAL‐LIFE NAME AND
ADDRESS OF THIS DEATH GUN IS.

303
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,225
JUST MAKE A LIST OF THE HANDLES

304
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,269
OF ALL THE SURVIVING
LAUGHING COFFIN MEMBERS.

305
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,479
THEN CONTACT THEIR I. S. P. s,

306
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,690
ASK WHICH ONE'S
PLAYING "G. G. O." NOW,

307
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,275
AND TRACE THEIR LOCATION.

308
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,110
Kikuoka: NO. SORRY,
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

309
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,820
THE I. S. P. s
AREN'T GOING TO GIVE OUT

310
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,113
A PLAYER'S REAL‐LIFE INFO

311
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,615
IF ALL WE HAVE TO GO ON
ARE THEIR HANDLES.

312
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,784
Silica: MAYBE IF WE ASK
THE GAME'S ADMINS,

313
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,785
THEY COULD HELP.

314
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,078
Kikuoka: THEY MIGHT,

315
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,997
BUT "G. G. O.'s" ADMINS
ARE IN THE U. S.,

316
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,082
SO IT'LL BE A WHILE
BEFORE WE GOT AN ANSWER.

317
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,085
Leafa: I KNOW MY BROTHER,

318
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,422
AND RIGHT NOW, HE'S RISKING
HIS LIFE IN THAT GAME,

319
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,091
TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHO THIS PERSON IS.

320
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,720
WHEN HE CAME HOME LAST NIGHT,
HE HAD THIS LOOK ON HIS FACE,

321
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,430
LIKE HE'D SEEN A GHOST.

322
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,600
HE MUST HAVE BUMPED INTO THE GUY
YESTERDAY DURING THE PRELIMS.

323
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,977
I BET THAT'S WHEN HE REALIZED

324
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,147
SOMEONE FROM LAUGHING COFFIN
WAS IN "G. G. O.,"

325
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:25,151
SOMEONE WHO FIGURED OUT HOW
TO KILL PLAYERS FOR REAL AGAIN.

326
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:28,487
MY BROTHER WENT BACK
TO PUT AN END TO THAT NIGHTMARE,

327
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,867
TO FIND OUT HIS NAME, AND STOP
HIS P.K.ING ONCE AND FOR ALL.

328
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,369
Asuna: (THINKING)
DARN IT, KIRITO.

329
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,371
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

330
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,666
WHY? WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DO THIS?

331
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,376
Kirito: THAT DAMN IDIOT!

332
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,003
WHY DIDN'T HE SAY ANYTHING?

333
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,172
I COULD BE
BACKING HIM UP RIGHT NOW,

334
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,342
ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS ASK, AND I
WOULD HAVE CONVERTED OVER, TOO.

335
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,927
Silica: WE ALL WOULD HAVE.

336
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,512
DON'T YOU SEE?
THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T TELL US.

337
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,974
IF HE THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY REAL
DANGER IN WHAT HE WAS DOING,

338
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,810
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'D GET US MIXED UP IN IT, TOO.

339
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,187
THAT'S JUST HOW HE IS.

340
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,480
Lisbeth: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

341
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,815
HE ALWAYS THINKS OF OTHERS
BEFORE HIMSELF.

342
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,151
IN FACT, HE'S PROBABLY
PROTECTING SOMEONE RIGHT NOW,

343
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,694
AND WHOEVER THAT IS,

344
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,197
I BET IT'S SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T LIKE HIM MUCH.

345
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,955
Asuna: OKAY, CHRYSHEIGHT,
WHERE IS KIRITO DIVING FROM?

346
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,874
I KNOW YOU KNOW,
SO YOU BETTER TELL ME NOW.

347
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,167
Kikuoka: MM...

348
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,128
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

349
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,673
EH, OKAY, OKAY. I'LL TELL YOU.

350
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,259
I SET UP THE ROOM MYSELF,
SO HE'S SAFE.

351
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,593
SECURITY'S ROCK‐SOLID,

352
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,929
AND THE MONITORING'S
TOP OF THE LINE.

353
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,057
I'VE GOT A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL
RIGHT BY HIS SIDE AT ALL TIMES,

354
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,643
AND I GUARANTEE THAT HIS BODY'S
IN NO DANGER WHATSOEVER.

355
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,852
Asuna: WHERE IS HE?!

356
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,604
Kikuoka: A HOSPITAL.

357
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,606
IT'S IN OCHANOMIZU
IN CHIYODA WARD.

358
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,608
Asuna: HE'S IN CHIYODA?

359
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,694
WAIT. IS THAT THE SAME HOSPITAL

360
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,696
HE WAS IN
DURING HIS REHABILITATION?

361
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,281
Kikuoka: YES, THAT'S THE ONE.

362
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,616
Asuna: I'M GOING OVER THERE.
I WANT TO SEE HIM,

363
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,493
AND YOU CAN'T DO
A THING ABOUT IT.

364
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,296
Sinon: TELL ME YOU GOT A PLAN.

365
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,090
Kirito: WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE OUT DEATH GUN.

366
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,675
ONCE WE DO,

367
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,136
HIS REAL WORLD PARTNER'LL
STAND DOWN.

368
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,179
THEN HE'LL JUST LEAVE
YOUR APARTMENT.

369
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,849
Sinon: OKAY, BUT HE'S SKILLED,

370
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,101
BLACK STAR OR NO BLACK STAR.

371
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,770
YOU SAW.
HE DODGED HECATE'S BULLET

372
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,982
FROM JUST 100 METERS AWAY.

373
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:32,069
AND BESIDES, I CAN'T HIDE
IN THIS CAVE FOREVER, YOU KNOW.

374
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,487
BY NOW, THE OTHER PLAYERS

375
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,032
PROBABLY FIGURED OUT
THE TWO OF US ARE IN HERE.

376
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,950
WE MIGHT AS WELL
BE SITTING DUCKS.

377
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,827
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME

378
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,621
BEFORE SOMEONE
TOSSES A GRENADE IN.

379
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,247
Kirito: YOU'RE RIGHT.

380
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,167
Sinon: WE'VE BEEN A TEAM
THIS WHOLE TIME ANYWAY, RIGHT?

381
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,127
MIGHT AS WELL
FINISH IT TOGETHER.

382
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,754
Kirito: OKAY,

383
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,882
BUT THERE'S STILL THE RISK
HE SHOOTS YOU WITH THAT GUN.

384
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,342
Sinon: OH, THAT THING.

385
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,677
IT'S JUST AN OLD‐SCHOOL
SINGLE‐ACTION SIDEARM.

386
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,139
HE CAN FIRE IT ALL HE WANTS,
BUT I GOT YOU THERE.

387
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,141
JUST DEFLECT THE BULLETS
WITH YOUR SWORD.

388
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,394
Kirito: RIGHT, AND I WON'T LET
A SINGLE ONE OF 'EM HIT YOU.

389
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:08,508
I STILL DON'T FEEL GOOD

390
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,147
ABOUT YOU BEING
OUT THERE, THOUGH.

391
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:11,440
I MEAN, DEATH GUN'S DANGEROUS,

392
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:13,567
AND YOU SHOULDN'T GET
TOO CLOSE TO HIM.

393
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:14,902
Sinon: OH, COME ON.

394
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,737
Kirito: HANG ON.
I'M TOTALLY COOL

395
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:20,407
WITH YOU FIGHTING WITH ME, AND I
WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY,

396
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:22,701
BUT, SINON,
YOU'RE A SNIPER, REMEMBER?

397
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:25,412
ISN'T YOUR SPECIALTY
THE LONG‐RANGE ATTACK?

398
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:27,331
Sinon: WELL, YEAH.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

399
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:28,624
Kirito: HERE'S THE PLAN.

400
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:29,958
ON THE NEXT SCAN,

401
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,169
I'M GONNA STEP OUTSIDE
SO IT PICKS ME UP.

402
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,963
THAT WAY, WE'LL GET
DEATH GUN TO COME TO US.

403
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:37,174
HE'LL PROBABLY KEEP HIS DISTANCE
AND TAKE COVER.

404
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:39,802
THEN HE'LL TRY TO PICK ME OFF
WITH HIS RIFLE.

405
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:41,762
WHEN HE SHOOTS,
WE'LL KNOW WHERE HE IS,

406
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:43,263
AND THEN YOU TAKE HIM OUT.

407
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:44,598
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

408
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,809
Sinon: ARE YOU COOL
WITH PLAYING THE DECOY?

409
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,310
Kirito: MM‐HMM.

410
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:51,021
Sinon: ALL RIGHT.
WE DO IT YOUR WAY THEN.

411
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:52,606
JUST BE CAREFUL OUT THERE,

412
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:54,441
'CAUSE IF HE DROPS YOU
WITH HIS FIRST SHOT,

413
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:55,943
I'M GONNA BE PISSED.

414
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:58,403
Kirito: HEH.
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

415
00:19:58,445 --> 00:20:00,197
WAIT. I JUST REMEMBERED.

416
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,658
HIS RIFLE'S GOT A SILENCER,
AND YOU WON'T SEE

417
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,535
THE BULLET LINE
ON THE FIRST SHOT.

418
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:06,870
Sinon: OH, I'LL JUST PREDICT
THE PREDICTION,

419
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:09,498
YOU KNOW, LIKE A CERTAIN
NO‐GOOD FAKER TOLD‐‐

420
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,085
Kirito: UM, I THINK
WE SHOULD STOP TALKING.

421
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:14,169
Sinon: UH...

422
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:18,507
UGH. OH, CRAP.

423
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:20,676
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PAYING MORE ATTENTION.

424
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:22,261
Kirito: WHAT IS IT?

425
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:24,304
AND WILL IT KILL US?

426
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,098
Sinon:
IT'S A LIVE‐STREAM CAMERA.

427
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,142
USUALLY THEY'RE
ONLY SUPPOSED TO SHADOW

428
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,434
PLAYERS ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

429
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:31,478
I GUESS THIS ONE'S
IN HERE NOW

430
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,438
'CAUSE THERE AREN'T
MANY OF US LEFT OUT THERE.

431
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,190
Kirito: THEN DO YOU...

432
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:36,525
THINK IT HEARD US?

433
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,735
Sinon: NOT A CHANCE.
FOR IT TO PICK US UP,

434
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:41,196
WE'D HAVE TO BE SHOUTING
AT THE TOP OF OUR LUNGS.

435
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:43,157
WAVE TO THE AUDIENCE.

436
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:45,868
UNLESS YOU GOT
SOMEONE BACK AT HOME

437
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,536
YOU DON'T WANT SEEING THIS.

438
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:48,745
Kirito: (GRUNTS)

439
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:51,540
UH, I, UM...

440
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:54,126
SHOULDN'T YOU BE WORRIED
WHO'S WATCHING?

441
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:56,545
I MEAN, SINCE I SORT OF
LOOK LIKE A GIRL,

442
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:58,463
THEY MIGHT, YOU KNOW,
THINK YOU'RE, YOU KNOW.

443
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:01,383
Sinon: I DON'T CARE.
THEY CAN THINK WHAT THEY WANT.

444
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:04,636
THE GUYS IN THIS GAME ARE DORKS.
IF THEY THINK I'M GAY,

445
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:07,097
AT LEAST THEY'LL STOP HITTING
ON ME EVERY FIVE SECONDS.

446
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:08,515
Kirito: HOW MUCH LONGER

447
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:10,767
AM I GONNA HAVE TO KEEP
PRETENDING TO BE A GIRL?

448
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,436
Sinon: OH, YOU POOR BABY.

449
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:15,272
YOU'VE BEEN FAKING IT LIKE
A CHAMP SINCE YOU LOGGED IN.

450
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:17,566
ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO
WON'T MATTER.

451
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,109
THANK GOD.

452
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:21,153
(SIGHS)

453
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:23,322
WE BETTER GET READY.

454
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:26,241
WE GOT TWO MINUTES
BEFORE THE NEXT SAT SCAN.

455
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:27,576
I'LL SET UP HERE.

456
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:30,120
WHEN YOU GET OUTSIDE,
FIRE UP YOUR TERMINAL,

457
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:32,831
AND LET ME KNOW
WHEN OUR BOY'S CLOSE.

458
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:38,253
Kirito: WAIT. HOLD ON.

459
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,713
Sinon: WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

460
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:42,382
IT'S TOO LATE
TO CHANGE THE PLAN NOW.

461
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:45,052
Kirito: NO, I DON'T WANT
TO CHANGE ANYTHING.

462
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,720
IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

463
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:50,057
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
DEATH GUN'S REAL HANDLE HERE.

464
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:51,850
THE ONLY NAME
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE

465
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:53,518
WHO'S STILL ALIVE IS STERBEN.

466
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,811
Sinon: OH. HUH.

467
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:56,480
I GUESS THAT'S HIM THEN.

468
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:59,691
I WONDER WHY HE GAVE HIMSELF
THAT NAME, THOUGH.

469
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,652
Kirito: IF I GET
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL,

470
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:03,654
I'LL BE SURE TO ASK HIM FOR YOU.

471
00:22:06,198 --> 00:22:08,242
WELL, HERE GOES NOTHING.

472
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,870
Sinon: BE CAREFUL, OKAY?
