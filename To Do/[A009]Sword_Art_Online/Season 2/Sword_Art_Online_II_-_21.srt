IT'S TOO HIGH UP TO REACH,

147

JUST USE OUR SWORD SKILLS

149
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,916

278
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,406
WE SAID WE'D GIVE YOU WHATEVER
THE BOSS DROPPED IN RETURN.

279
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:09,991
IT WAS MONEY, THOUGH,

280
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:13,787
AND WE SPENT A LOT OF IT ON FOOD
AND DRINK FOR OUR PARTY.

281

I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU
BETTER, YUUKI.

290
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:42,232
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:43,733
Yuuki: ASUNA,

292

IT'S LIKE THIS IS
A TEMPORARY THING FOR US,

298
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:12,804
AND, LIKE, COME SPRING,
WE'LL BE SPLITTING UP,
