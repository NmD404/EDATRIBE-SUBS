00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,639
AND YOUR SWORD SKILLS,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,100
ARE YOU THE REAL DEAL OR WHAT?

(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

5
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,279
Kirito: IF HE KNOWS ME,
I SHOULD KNOW HIM.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,742
THAT'S IT.

7
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:37,120
HE'S AN "S. A. O." SURVIVOR.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,544
WHO IS HE,

9
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,339
AND WHERE DID WE MEET
IN "S. A. O."?

10
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,472
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

11
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,887
Death Gun: ANSWER THE QUESTION.

12
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,765
OR DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

13
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,767
Kirito: NO, I DON'T.

14
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,438
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "REAL DEAL"?

15
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,189
Death Gun: NEVER MIND.

16
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,359
WHETHER YOU'RE
A FAKE USING HIS NAME

17
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,445
OR THE REAL GUY,

18
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,781
SOMEDAY I'LL KILL YOU.

THE EMBLEM ON HIS WRIST

23
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,206
BELONGED TO THE MURDER GUILD
FROM "S. A. O."

24
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,667
LAUGHING COFFIN.

25
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,504
GOD KNOWS HOW MANY PLAYERS
THEY KILLED IN THEIR TIME.

26
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,799
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES

27
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,427

Schmidt:
IF THE TIP WE GOT'S GOOD,

30
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,760
WE SHOULD BE NEAR
LAUGHING COFFIN'S BASE,

31
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,305
BUT BEFORE WE CHARGE IN,
LET'S KEEP ONE THING IN MIND.

32
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,850
THOSE GUYS ARE RED PLAYERS.

33
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,560
ONCE THE BATTLE STARTS,

34
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,939
THEY'RE NOT GONNA THINK TWICE
ABOUT KILLING ANY ONE OF US,

35
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,565
SO DON'T YOU HESITATE.

36
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,025
YOU DO, AND YOU'RE DEAD.

Schmidt: WE'VE GOT TWO THINGS
GOING FOR US, THOUGH.

39
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,282
WE OUTNUMBER THEM, AND WE'VE
GOT HIGHER SKILL LEVELS.

40
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,202
SO WHO KNOWS? MAYBE THEY'LL
SURRENDER PEACEFULLY.

41
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,663

45
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,274
SOMEONE MUST HAVE LEAKED
OUR PLANS TO THESE BASTARDS!

Player 2: (CHUCKLES)

47
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,964
Kirito:
THEY CAUGHT US OFF GUARD,

48
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,216
BUT WE REGROUPED IN TIME.

49
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,885
WE CAN DO THIS.

50
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,688
Player 3: YOU'RE OUTNUMBERED.

51
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,440
SURRENDER NOW, OR ELSE.

52
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,817
Player 4: COME ON.
DROP YOUR SWORD.

53
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,861
Player 3: DO IT!

54
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,154
YOU CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER HIT!

55
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,364

Player 6: (GROANS, GURGLES)

61
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,194
Kirito: IT TURNED INTO

62
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,030
A BLOOD‐SOAKED NIGHTMARE
AFTER THAT.

63
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,449
WE WON THE BATTLE,

64
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,493
BUT BY THE TIME IT WAS OVER,

65
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,787
WE'D LOST TEN OF OURS.

66
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,332
AS FOR LAUGHING COFFIN,

67
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,960
TWENTY OF THEM REFUSED
TO SURRENDER AND WERE KILLED.

68
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,963
OUT OF THAT TWENTY,

69
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:49,386
TWO LIVES WERE CLAIMED
BY MY SWORD.

70
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,895
THAT GUY...

71
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,315
IF HE'S ONE OF THE SURVIVORS
FROM LAUGHING COFFIN,

72
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:07,195
THEN HE MUST HAVE TALKED TO ME
AT SOME POINT AFTER THAT BATTLE,

73
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:12,325
OR MAYBE HE'S ONE
OF THE TWO PEOPLE I KILLED.

74
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,787
NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

75
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,414
THAT'S CRAZY.

76
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,000
Death Gun: ...THE NAME I SHARE
WITH THIS WEAPON, DEATH GUN.

77
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,086
Kirito: OH, MY GOD.

78
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,797
HIS VOICE WAS
THE SAME AS DEATH GUN'S.

79
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,466
WAS THAT HIM?

80
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,928
COULD HE BE DEATH GUN?

81
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,771
Sinon: YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE IT.

82
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,440
Kirito: NO, I'M OKAY.

83
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,776
Sinon: GUESS YOUR FIRST MATCH
WAS TOUGHER THAN YOU THOUGHT.

84
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,695
YOU GOT BACK
PRETTY EARLY, THOUGH.

85
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,697
NOT TOO SHABBY FOR A NOOB.

86
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,743
GOD, IF YOU'RE LIKE THIS
AFTER ONE MATCH,

87
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,995
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT
TO THE FINALS.

88
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,205
YOU BETTER MAN UP, GUY.

89
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,458
REMEMBER, WE GOT
THINGS TO SETTLE.

90
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,379
HEY, LET GO!

91
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,766

00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,604

GOT A DEATH WISH OR WHAT?

Spiegel: HUH. I CAN'T BELIEVE

100
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,732
HE KEEPS WINNING
FIGHTING LIKE THAT.

101
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,152
HIS NEXT MATCH
IS IN THE SEMIFINALS.

102
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,698
YOURS IS, TOO,
SO GET OUT THERE AND ROCK.

103
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,740
GOOD LUCK.

104
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,836
Sinon: STINGER IS MY TARGET.

105
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,214
HIS MAIN WEAPON IS
AN FN‐SCAR CARBINE RIFLE.

106
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,551
AS A SNIPER,
IF I LET HIM GET TOO CLOSE,

107
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,052
I'M DONE FOR.

108
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,387
BUT ON THIS MAP,

109
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,723
IF HE WANTS TO CLOSE IN ON ME,

110
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,766
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THERE,

111
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,852
AND THAT'S
WHERE I'LL TAKE HIM OUT.

112
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,032
(SIGHS) DAMN HIM.

113
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,964
HE WANTED ME TO WASTE
MY FIRST SHOT

114
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,634
TO BUY HIM TIME
SO HE COULD ADVANCE.

115
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,430
TOO BAD FOR HIM,

116
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,433
'CAUSE I KNOW THE PATH
MY FIRST BULLET TOOK.

117
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,270
MY SECOND ONE'LL BE
RIGHT ON TARGET.

118
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,117
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOT
OUT OF THE CAR, BUDDY.

119
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,203
IF YOU DID, YOU MIGHT HAVE
SEEN THE BULLET LINE

120
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,287
IN TIME TO DODGE IT.

00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,331
(FANFARE PLAYING)

122
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,178
Sinon: HE'S GONNA TRY
AND CLOSE IN ON ME

123
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,888
USING THE SHADOWS FOR COVER.

124
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,975
MY ONLY CHANCE IS NAILING HIM
WITH THE FIRST SHOT,

125
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,144
BEFORE HE FIGURES OUT
MY LOCATION.

126
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,398
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIT HIM.

127
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,863
WHAT'S MY PROBLEM?

128
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,866
WHY DO I WANT
TO BEAT HIM SO BAD?

129
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,620
IS IT 'CAUSE HE
REMINDS ME OF ME?

130
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:03,051
DOES HE THINK HE CAN DODGE
MY BULLET AT THIS RANGE?

131
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,152
DOES HE EVEN WANT TO?

COME ON, FIGHT!

139
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,473
OR MAYBE YOU THINK
I'M NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.

140
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,475
Kirito: YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.

141
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,478
ALL I WANT
IS TO COMPETE IN THE FINAL.

142
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,480
THERE'S NO REASON
TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

143
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,065
Sinon: THEN GO ON
AND SHOOT YOURSELF,

144
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,233
AND GET IT OVER WITH!

145
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,943
OR WOULD THAT BE
A WASTE OF AMMO?

146
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,362
OR MAYBE YOU WANTED ME
TO SHOOT YOU

147

'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD
EVEN THE SCORE BETWEEN US.

THAT'S ALL IT IS TO YOU,
IS THAT IT, A GAME?

WELL, JUST 'CAUSE YOU FEEL
THAT WAY DOESN'T MEAN I DO!

152

BUT IF WE DO MEET IN THE FINAL
BRACKET OF THE PRELIMS,

153
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,842
I'LL BE PLAYING TO WIN.

NO HOLDING BACK.

SURE, IT'S A GAME.

159

IT'S ONLY ONE MATCH.

160
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,741
BUT STILL, THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO GIVE IT ALL WE GOT.

161
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,159
IT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

162
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,870

HOW WE KEEP SURVIVING.

KNOWN THAT, IT'S ME.

TO MAKE IT RIGHT WITH YOU.

THE FIGHT I PROMISED.

IF YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME...

LEFT ON YOU, OR ARE YOU OUT?

Sinon: YEAH, I GOT ONE.

169
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,490

THEN LET'S HAVE A DUEL.

170
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,950
HERE'S THE RULES.

171
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,618
WE'LL STAND TEN METERS APART,

172
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,621
YOU WITH YOUR RIFLE,
AND ME WITH MY SWORD.

173
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,206
I'LL TOSS THIS BULLET UP,

174
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,792
AND WHEN IT HITS THE GROUND,
WE START.

175
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,252
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

176
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,628
Sinon: HANG ON.

177
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,755
IF WE'RE TEN METERS
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER,

178
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,509
IT WON'T GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO
SEE THE BULLET LINE AND REACT,

179
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,178
AND WITH MY HECATE,
I'LL DEFINITELY HIT YOU.

180
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,389
AT THAT RANGE, I CAN'T MISS.

181
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,267
Kirito: YOU WON'T KNOW FOR SURE
TILL YOU TRY.

182
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,104
Sinon: WHY'S HE ACTING
SO CONFIDENT?

183
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,941
DOES HE HAVE A PLAN
OR SOMETHING?

184
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,903
WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M READY FOR IT.

185
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,238
OKAY.

186
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,783
IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT IT,
LET'S GO.

187
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,975
I KNEW IT.

188
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,810
HE DOES HAVE A PLAN.

189
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,108
Kirito: 'KAY. GET SET.

190
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,483
Sinon: NO WAY.

191
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,777
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

192
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,919
YOU KNEW WHERE I WAS AIMING.

193
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,214
BUT HOW? HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WAS GOING FOR YOUR LEG?

194
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,966
Kirito: I KNEW,
'CAUSE I COULD SEE YOUR EYE

195
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,718
THROUGH THE LENS OF YOUR SCOPE.

196
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,847
Sinon: THAT'S HOW HE
PREDICTED MY BULLET'S PATH?

197
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,058
THAT'S AMAZING.

198
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,979
THAT KIND OF POWER'S
WAY BEYOND ANY V. R. GAME.

199
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,649
IF YOU'RE SO STRONG
YOU CAN DO THAT,

200
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,818
WHY'D YOU LOOK SO AFRAID BEFORE?

201
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,238
Kirito: YOU'RE WRONG.
IT'S NOT STRENGTH.

202
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,781
ALL IT IS IS A SKILL.

203
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,950
Sinon: NO, IT'S NOT.

204
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,954
TECHNIQUE ISN'T ENOUGH TO CUT
A BULLET FROM MY HECATE IN HALF.

205
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,664
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT.

206
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,915
IT TAKES STRENGTH,

207
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,835
AND ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS HOW TO GET IT.

208
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,797
IT'S WHAT I‐‐IT'S WHAT
I'M HERE TO FIGURE OUT.

209
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,592
Kirito: LISTEN, COULD YOU
SHOOT A PLAYER IN HERE

210
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,638
IF YOU KNEW, IN THE REAL WORLD,
THAT PLAYER WOULD DIE FROM IT?

211
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,391
AND WHAT IF YOU
HAD TO KILL THAT PLAYER,

212
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,726
'CAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T,

213
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,061
YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE
WOULD DIE INSTEAD?

214
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,813
IF YOU HAD THAT POWER,

215
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,857
COULD YOU STILL PULL
THAT TRIGGER?

216
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,278
Sinon: DOES HE KNOW

217
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,781
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME THAT DAY?

218
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:45,035
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HAPPENED TO HIM, TOO.

219
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,374
Kirito: I CAN'T
GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

220
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,171
SO I'M NOT AS STRONG
AS YOU THINK I AM.

221
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,840
I DON'T KNOW
THE NAMES OF THE TWO‐‐

222
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,635
NO, THREE PEOPLE I KILLED
IN THAT OTHER GAME.

223
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,055
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

224
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,350
AND EVERY DAY,
I KEEP HOPING I'LL FORGET.

225
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,613
I'M FINE.

226
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,615
ANYWAY, I GUESS THIS MEANS

227
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,366
I WON THE DUEL, DOESN'T IT?

228
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,911
Sinon: HUH? OH.
YEAH, I GUESS.

229
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,829
Kirito: WELL, WOULD YOU MIND
SURRENDERING THEN?

230
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,290
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF SLASHING AT GIRLS.

231
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,333
Sinon: HUH?

232
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,759
NEXT TIME, I'M NOT GONNA LOSE.

233
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,427
SEE YOU IN THE FINALS.

234
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,931
AND MAKE SURE YOU SURVIVE
UNTIL YOU SEE ME AGAIN.

235
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,265
RESIGN.

236
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,941
Players: (GASPING)

237
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,199
Spiegel: HUH?
