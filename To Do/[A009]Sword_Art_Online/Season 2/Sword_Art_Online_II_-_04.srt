1
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,636
Kirito:
I'M NINETY‐NINE PERCENT SURE

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,554
THE DEATH GUN STORY'S A HOAX,

3
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,057
PROBABLY SOMEONE TROLLING.

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,851
YOU CAN'T KILL SOMEONE
IN THE REAL WORLD

5
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,269
FROM THE VIRTUAL ANYMORE.

6
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,230
I KNOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

7
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,025
BUT THERE'S STILL
THAT ONE PERCENT CHANCE

8
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,985
IT COULD BE TRUE.

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,737
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,492
LINK START!

11
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,596
IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT
THAN A. L. O.

12
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,685
GO FIGURE. KILLING PEOPLE'S
THE POINT IN HERE.

13
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,771
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

14
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,151
HMM?

15
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,948
(GASPS)

16
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,837
(GASPS)

17
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,632
HOLY CRAP!

18
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,562
I WISH I LOOKED
A LITTLE MORE SOLDIERISH.

19
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,481
Player: HOLY BAZONGERS!

20
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,650
THAT'S THE F‐1300 MODEL,
ISN'T IT?!

21
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,485
THAT AVATAR'S SO RARE,

22
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,278
I'VE ONLY HEARD ABOUT THEM
TILL NOW.

23
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,780
I WANT IT.

24
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,782
I'LL GIVE YOU TWO MEGA‐CREDITS
FOR YOUR ACCOUNT.

25
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,659
COME ON, LADY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

26
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,952
Kirito: L‐LADY?

27
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:22,994
(GASPS)

28
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,127
UM, HATE TO BREAK IT YOU, GUY,

29
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,753
BUT I'M A GUY, TOO.

30
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,046
Player: HOLY CRAP!

31
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,840
THEN THAT MEANS
YOU GOT THE M‐9000 MODEL!

32
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,008
I'LL GIVE YOU FOUR,
NO, FIVE FOR IT.

33
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,678
SELL IT TO ME.
COME ON. SELL IT TO ME.

34
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,056
Kirito: SORRY, BUT THIS
ISN'T A DEFAULT AVATAR.

35
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,391
IT'S A CONVERTED ONE.

36
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,601
I CAN'T EXCHANGE IT FOR CASH.

37
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,937
Player: AWW, THAT SUCKS.

38
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,566
Kirito: YEAH, WELL, LATER.

39
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,985
Player: HEY, IF YOU
EVER CHANGE YOUR MIND,

40
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,486
GIVE ME THE FIRST BID.

41
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,156
Kirito: (GROANS)

42
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,414
IF I WANT TO GET
DEATH GUN'S ATTENTION,

43
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,375
I HAVE TO MAKE A NAME
FOR MYSELF FIRST.

44
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,043
Player 2: (WHISTLES)

45
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,211
Player 3: LOOKING FOR
SOME ACTION? 'CAUSE HERE IT IS.

46
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,254
WHAT? ARE YOU TOO GOOD FOR ME?

47
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,282
Kirito: I'M TOTALLY LOST.

48
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,827
SOME SHORTCUT
THIS TURNED OUT TO BE.

49
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,415
UH, EXCUSE ME.

50
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,501
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE...

51
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,588
UH‐OH.
SHE THINKS I'M HITTING ON HER.

52
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,133
Sinon: YEAH? WHAT?

53
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,676
Kirito: UH...

54
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,599
Sinon: YOUR FIRST TIME
IN THE GAME, HUH?

55
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,520
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

56
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,938
I, UM...

57
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,066
OH, MY GOD.

58
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,693
SHE THINKS I'M A GIRL, TOO.

59
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,570
Sinon: WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO?

60
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,947
Kirito: UH...

61
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,407
I, UH...

62
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,076
(CHUCKLES)

63
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,246
(GROANING)

64
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,840
YES, IT'S MY FIRST TIME.

65
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,926
I'M LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO BUY A CHEAP GUN.

66
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,847
OH, AND I ALSO NEED TO FIND OUT
WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS.

67
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,848
(GIGGLES)

68
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,766
Sinon: OH. SURE.

69
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,102
I CAN SHOW YOU.

70
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,854
Kirito: IT'S NOT COOL,

71
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,774
BUT I'LL LET HER KEEP THINKING
I'M A GIRL FOR A WHILE.

72
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,236
Sinon: BY THE WAY,

73
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,572
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE?

74
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,782
Kirito: UH, I WANTED
TO SIGN MYSELF UP

75
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,118
FOR AN EVENT
CALLED BULLET OF BULLETS.

76
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,619
Sinon: B. O. B.?

77
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,290
OKAY, BUT YOU JUST STARTED
PLAYING TODAY, RIGHT?

78
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,416
Kirito: YES.

79
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,334
Sinon: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

80
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,337
YOUR STATS MAY NOT BE
HIGH ENOUGH FOR THAT.

81
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,423
Kirito: OH.
WELL, I CONVERTED,

82
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,676
SO ALL MY SKILLS HAVE BEEN
TRANSFERRED FROM ANOTHER GAME.

83
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,344
Sinon: IF YOU SAY SO.

84
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,391
SO, ANYWAY, YOU PICKED
A HECK OF A GAME TO PLAY.

85
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,144
IT'S ALL GRIMY
AND STINKS OF OIL.

86
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:37,731
Kirito: MM, WELL, I'VE ONLY
PLAYED FANTASY GAMES UP TO NOW.

87
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,359
THEY'RE FUN, BUT I THOUGHT
I'D TRY A CYBER‐GAME FOR ONCE.

88
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:47,574
I WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN SEEING
WHAT GUN BATTLES WERE LIKE.

89
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,867
Sinon: REALLY?

90
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,244
IT TAKES GUTS TO WANT
TO START WITH B. O. B.

91
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,871
RIGHT OFF THE BAT LIKE THAT.

92
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,247
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

93
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,625
Sinon: LET'S HOOK YOU UP
WITH A GUN THEN.

94
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,835
I KNOW THIS GREAT MARKET.
IT'S DOWN HERE.

95
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,253
Kirito: OKAY.

96
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,770
WOW. THIS PLACE LOOKS
LIKE IT HAS EVERYTHING.

97
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,397
Sinon: YEAH, WELL,
THE TWO TYPES OF WEAPONS

98
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,399
THAT ARE MOSTLY USED IN GGO

99
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,234
ARE OPTICAL GUNS
AND LIVE‐AMMO GUNS.

100
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,402
Kirito: HUH.

101
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,029
Sinon:
AN OPTICAL GUN'S LIGHTER

102
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,406
AND MORE ACCURATE,
BUT IT HAS ITS DRAWBACKS.

103
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,492
IF YOUR OPPONENT
EQUIPS THEIR DEFENSE SHIELD,

104
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,285
IT ONLY DOES HALF THE DAMAGE.

105
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,663
FOR A ONE‐ON‐ONE TOURNEY
LIKE B. O. B.,

106
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,665
A LIVE‐AMMO GUN'S THE BEST BET.

107
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,916
Kirito: OH. OKAY.

108
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,671
Sinon: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S START WITH YOUR STATS,

109
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,172
HIGHEST ONE FIRST.

110
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,384
Kirito: UM, I GUESS
MY STRENGTH IS THE HIGHEST,

111
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,678
AND SPEED AFTER THAT.

112
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,390
Sinon: YOU'RE
AN STR‐AGI TYPE, HUH?

113
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,601
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT TWO CHOICES
FOR YOUR MAIN WEAPON,

114
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,480
EITHER A HEAVY ASSAULT RIFLE
OR A LARGE‐CALIBER MACHINE GUN.

115
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,065
WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE,

116
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,985
YOU'RE ALSO GONNA NEED A HANDGUN
FOR A BACKUP WEAPON.

117
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,445
OH, WAIT A SEC.

118
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,115
YOU SAID YOU JUST
CONVERTED OVER, DIDN'T YOU?

119
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,700
DO YOU HAVE ANY CREDITS?

120
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,076
Kirito: YEAH, I SHOULD.

121
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,912
LET'S SEE.

122
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,039
IT SAYS I HAVE
A THOUSAND CREDITS.

123
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,250
Sinon: EVERYBODY GETS THAT
WHEN THEY START.

124
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,043
Kirito: OH. (LAUGHS)

125
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,087
Sinon: HMM.
IF THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE,

126
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,257
THE MOST YOU CAN AFFORD'S
GONNA BE A SMALL RAY GUN.

127
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,717
AND FOR A LIVE‐AMMO GUN,

128
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,136
A THOUSAND WON'T EVEN
GET YOU A USED REVOLVER.

129
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,598
LISTEN, IF YOU WANT,

130
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,226
I COULD LOAN YOU THE MONEY
TO BUY A GUN.

131
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,019
Kirito:
THAT'S REALLY SWEET OF YOU,

132
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,813
BUT I COULDN'T. UH, I KNOW.

133
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,732
DOES THIS GAME
HAVE ANYTHING IN IT

134
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,943
WHERE A NEW PLAYER LIKE ME
COULD GO EARN SOME MONEY?

135
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,695
Sinon: WELL,
I DON'T RECOMMEND THEM,

136
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,740
BUT THERE ARE CASINOS
AND GAMBLING GAMES,

137
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,949
LIKE THAT ONE.

138
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,041
Gunslinger:
HEY, CHICKEN, COME ON.

139
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,209
Kirito: HOW DO YOU PLAY?

140
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,794
Sinon: YOU ENTER
THROUGH THAT GATE

141
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,213
AND GO DOWN THE ALLEY,
DODGING THE NPC's BULLETS.

142
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,631
THE IDEA IS TO GET

143
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,217
AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN TO HIM
WITHOUT GETTING SHOT.

144
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,635
IF YOU CAN TOUCH HIM,

145
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,096
YOU WIN ALL THE CASH
EVERYONE'S SUNK INTO IT

146
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,973
SINCE THE LAST TIME
IT WAS BEAT.

147
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,183
Kirito: ALL OF IT?!

148
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,310
Sinon: THREE HUNDRED THOU
AND CHANGE.

149
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,812
Kirito: NOW, THAT IS
A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY.

150
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,273
Sinon: WELL,
NO ONE'S BEATEN IT.

151
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,109
ONCE YOU GET EIGHT METERS
AWAY FROM THE GUNSLINGER,

152
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,320
HE SWITCHES TO THIS
WICKED‐FAST QUICK‐DRAW MODE.

153
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,490
BY THE TIME YOU SEE
THE BULLET LINES, IT'S TOO LATE.

154
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,116
Kirito: THE BULLET LINES?

155
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,451
Sinon: LOOK.
ANOTHER SUCKER'S

156
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,244
STEPPING UP
TO ADD TO THE JACKPOT.

157
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,704
Player 4:
TODAY'S THE DAY, MAN.

158
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,039
Player 5: YEAH, YOU GOT THIS.

159
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,207
Player 6: HERE GOES NOTHIN'.

160
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,005
Gunslinger:
I'M GONNA BLAST YOU

161
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,132
FROM HERE TO THE MOON,
YA VARMINT.

162
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,635
Players: (LAUGHING)

163
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,762
Player 7: HURRY UP,
AND DIE ALREADY.

164
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,389
Player 6: WATCH ME CLEAR
THIS BEEYOTCH IN NOTHING FLAT.

165
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,516
Player 4: JACKPOT'S YOURS.

166
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,267
Player 6: YEAH, YOU KNOW IT.

167
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,488
Kirito: WHY'S HE DOING THAT?

168
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,743
Spectators: (CHEERING)

169
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,411
Kirito: WAS THAT
THE BULLET LINE?

170
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,039
Sinon: YEP.
IT'S A DEFENSIVE SYSTEM ASSIST.

171
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,249
WE ALL HAVE IT.

172
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,917
EXCEPT FOR
A SNIPER'S FIRST SHOT,

173
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,836
BULLET PREDICTION LINES

174
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,796
ALWAYS SHOW UP
IN THE TARGET'S FIELD OF VISION.

175
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,430
Gunslinger: I'LL KILL YA.

176
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,891
Player 6: WHATEVER.
(LAUGHS)

177
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,018
Player 4: RUN, MAN!
Player 5: YOU SO GOT THIS!

178
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,312
Gunslinger: YOU LOSER.

179
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,116
GAME OVER, HOSS.

180
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,495
Player 8: WELL, THAT SUCKED.

181
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,122
Player 9: THAT GUY
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

182
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,123
Sinon: SEE?

183
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,666
THAT ALLEY IS SO NARROW,

184
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,085
YOU CAN'T MOVE
TOO FAR TO EITHER SIDE,

185
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,754
AND YOU'RE FORCED TO CHARGE
THE GUNSLINGER STRAIGHT ON.

186
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,048
THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR
AS ANYONE'S GOTTEN.

187
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,884
Kirito: AH, I GET IT.

188
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,553
IF I WAIT TO SEE
THE BULLET LINES,

189
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,138
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

190
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,515
Sinon: UH, HEY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

191
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,856
Player 6: TEN CREDS SAYS

192
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,482
THE NEWBIE GETS IT
OUT OF THE GATE.

193
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,775
Player 9: WHOA.

194
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,360
THAT'S THE CUTEST TARGET
I EVER SEEN.

195
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,196
Player 8: LET'S STICK AROUND
AND WATCH HER GET PWNED.

196
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,205
Gunslinger: I'LL KILL YA.

197
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,927
YOU LOSER.

198
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,558
Sinon: YOU'RE KIDDING.

199
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,477
Player 6: SHE PASSED
THE TEN‐METER MARK.

200
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,854
Player 4:
THAT IS ONE FAST KID.

201
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,106
Gunslinger: DIE, YOU VARMINT.

202
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,778
I'LL BLAST YOU TO HELL!

203
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,867
Kirito: LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S OUT OF BULLETS.

204
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,638
Gunslinger: NO!

205
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,116
HEY, CHICKEN, COME ON.

206
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,243
Player 9:
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

207
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,120
Player 8: WHO IS THAT KID?

208
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,330
Sinon: OH, MY GOD.

209
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,624
I'VE NEVER SEEN
REFLEXES LIKE THAT.

210
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,418
I MEAN, AT THE END,

211
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,921
YOU DODGED HIS LASERS
FROM ABOUT TWO METERS AWAY.

212
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,882
AT THAT RANGE, THE TIME BETWEEN
YOU SEEING THE BULLET LINES

213
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,801
AND THE SHOTS FIRED‐‐
WELL, THAT'S IT.

214
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,928
THERE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ANY TIME BETWEEN 'EM.

215
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,638
Kirito: OH. UM...

216
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,889
REALLY?

217
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,645
WELL, SINCE IT'S A GAME
OF DODGING BULLETS,

218
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,647
I JUST PREDICTED
THE BULLET LINES.

219
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,316
YOU KNOW,
PREDICT THE PREDICTIONS.

220
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,734
(CROWD MURMURING)

221
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,779
Sinon: YOU‐‐YOU PREDICTED
THE PREDICTIONS?!

222
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,197
Gunslinger: HUH?

223
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,660
(KIRITO GROANS)

224
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,537
I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THE SPECS

225
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,872
FOR THIS ASSAULT RIFLE.

226
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,415
I MEAN,
THIS THING'S GINORMOUS,

227
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,959
SO WHY'S THE CALIBER
OF THE BULLETS IT FIRES

228
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,377
SMALLER THAN
A SUBMACHINE GUN'S?

229
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,213
Sinon: I'M CONFUSED
ABOUT HOW SOMEONE LIKE YOU

230
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,841
CAN DODGE BULLETS LIKE A GHOST
AND NOT KNOW THAT.

231
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,260
YOU CONVERTED
FROM ANOTHER GAME.

232
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,262
WHAT'D YOU PLAY
BEFORE THIS ONE?

233
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,680
Kirito: NOTHING SPECIAL.

234
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,641
JUST ONE OF THOSE TYPICAL
FANTASY GAMES, IS ALL.

235
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,477
Sinon: HMM.

236
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,481
YEAH, SO YOU SAID.

237
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,149
WELL, DURING THE B. O. B. PRELIMS,

238
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,985
I'LL GET AN IDEA
OF WHAT YOU CAN REALLY DO.

239
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,445
Kirito: (LAUGHS)

240
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,197
Sinon: AS FOR
THE ASSAULT RIFLE,

241
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,200
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
IT USES A SMALL CALIBER?

242
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,618
Kirito: SURE.

243
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,038
Sinon: IT ALL GOES BACK
TO THE M16 FROM THE U. S.

244
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,707
THEY DESIGNED IT FOR PRECISION
AND PENETRATIVE POWER,

245
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,001
BUT USING A FAST,
SMALL‐CALIBER ROUND.

246
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,632
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW
THAT STUFF, THOUGH.

247
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,759
NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT
THREE HUNDRED K,

248
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,386
YOU CAN BUY PRETTY MUCH
WHATEVER GUN YOU WANT.

249
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,555
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO WHAT YOU WANT

250
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,933
AND WHAT YOU THINK'LL
WORK BEST FOR YOU.

251
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,768
Kirito:
WHAT DOES WORK FOR ME?

252
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,436
HMM.

253
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,816
HEY, WHAT ARE THESE?

254
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,403
Sinon: OH, THOSE ARE
PHOTON SWORDS.

255
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,738
Kirito: PHOTON.

256
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,490
Sinon: IT'S A BEAM OF LIGHT

257
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,325
THAT'S A WAVE
AND A PARTICLE.

258
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,910
PHOTON SWORD'S
THE OFFICIAL NAME,

259
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,579
BUT PEOPLE CALL 'EM
LASER BLADES, BEAM SABERS,

260
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,498
AND SOMETHING ELSE
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

261
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,292
Kirito: OH, COOL!
YOU CAN USE A SWORD HERE?

262
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,129
Sinon: YEAH, IF YOU WANT,
BUT NOBODY REALLY USES THEM.

263
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,547
Kirito: WHY DON'T THEY?

264
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,299
Sinon: WELL, I MEAN,
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE IT

265
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,843
UNLESS YOU'RE CLOSE
TO YOUR TARGET,

266
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,137
AND IF YOU'RE CRAZY ENOUGH
TO GET THAT CLOSE,

267
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,722
YOU'LL GET SHOT
FULL OF HOLES.

268
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,099
Kirito:
SO BASICALLY IT'S GOOD

269
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,059
AS LONG AS YOU
GET CLOSE ENOUGH.

270
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,561
Sinon: YEAH, I GUESS,

271
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,229
BUT EVEN WITH
YOUR SKILL AT DODGING,

272
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:42,316
IF THERE'S A FULL‐AUTO GUN
FIRING AT YO‐‐

273
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,152
UGH.

274
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,779
Robot: WELCOME, PLAYER.

275
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,286
Kirito: THANK YOU.

276
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,622
Robot: THANK YOU
FOR YOUR PURCHASE.

277
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,249
HAVE A NICE DAY.

278
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,333
Sinon: OH, WELL.

279
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,169
I GUESS
WHEN IT COMES TO COMBAT,

280
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,753
EVERYONE'S GOT
THEIR OWN STYLE.

281
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,673
Kirito: THE WAY I SEE IT,
IF THIS PLACE SELLS SOMETHING,

282
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,633
IT MUST BE OKAY FOR BATTLE,
EVEN THIS.

283
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,513
Both: WHOA.

284
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,022
Sinon: HUH.

285
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,025
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

286
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,491
WOW.

287
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,119
THOSE ARE
YOUR FANTASY GAME SKILLS?

288
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,412
NOT BAD.

289
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,415
Kirito: I KNOW
A COUPLE OF MOVES.

290
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,917
THIS SURE IS LIGHT.

291
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,879
Sinon: HUH?

292
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,178
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE DEAD SET

293
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,013
ON THAT FOR YOUR MAIN WEAPON,

294
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,182
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE
A SUBMACHINE GUN

295
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,351
OR A HANDGUN
IN YOUR INVENTORY, TOO.

296
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,812
IT'LL DISTRACT YOUR ENEMY
SO YOU CAN GET CLOSER.

297
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,481
Kirito: OH, OKAY.

298
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,775
Sinon: HOW MUCH
DO YOU HAVE LEFT?

299
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,401
Kirito: ABOUT A HUNDRED‐FIFTY K.

300
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,071
Sinon: WHOA. THOSE
PHOTON THINGIES ARE EXPENSIVE.

301
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,740
YOU GOT
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY K, HUH?

302
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,034
YOU STILL NEED TO GET
PROTECTIVE GEAR,

303
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,995
SOME KIND OF WEAPON,
AND THE AMMO FOR IT.

304
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,455
WHAT'S CHEAP, BUT GOOD?

305
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:22,875
Kirito: I'LL TRUST
YOUR JUDGMENT WITH ALL THAT.

306
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,088
Sinon: FOR B. O. B.,

307
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,007
A LIVE‐AMMO WEAPON'S
YOUR BEST BET.

308
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,678
IF I WERE YOU, I'D GO FOR
ACCURACY OVER STOPPING POWER.

309
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,096
HMM.

310
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,182
OH. YOU'LL SPEND MOST
OF YOUR CREDITS ON IT,

311
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,517
BUT THIS ONE'S GOOD,

312
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,769
THE FN FIVE SEVEN.

313
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,771
Kirito: WHAT'S FIVE SEVEN?

314
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,189
Sinon: THE BULLET CALIBER,

315
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,441
5.7 MILLIMETERS.

316
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,568
THEY'RE SMALLER THAN

317
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,735
THE NINE‐MILL
PARABELLUM BULLETS,

318
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,487
BUT THEY STILL PACK A PUNCH.

319
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,698
THEY'RE SIMILAR IN SHAPE
TO RIFLE BULLETS,

320
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,907
SO THEY'VE GOT THE EDGE

321
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,410
IN BOTH PRECISION
AND STOPPING POWER.

322
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,412
Kirito: HUH.

323
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,414
Sinon: HEY, ARE YOU
EVEN LISTENING?

324
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,499
Kirito: HUH? OH, YEAH.

325
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,209
I GUESS I'LL BUY
THAT ONE THEN.

326
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,170
IS THAT IT,
OR DO I NEED ANYTHING ELSE?

327
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,048
Sinon: YEAH, YOU DO.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A HOLSTER,

328
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,801
SOME EXTRA MAGS,
SOME PROTECTIVE GEAR.

329
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,930
AND YOU SHOULD ALSO GET YOURSELF
A DEFENSE FIELD AND RANGE TIME.

330
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,307
Kirito: WHAT'S THAT?

331
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,268
Sinon: YOU NEVER FIRED
A GUN BEFORE, HAVE YOU?

332
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,436
Kirito: UH‐UH, NEVER.

333
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,479
Sinon: LET'S CHANGE THAT.

334
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,361
Kirito: (GROANS)

335
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,739
Sinon: IF YOU BUY A GUN
FROM THE SHOP,

336
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,157
YOU CAN TEST IT HERE.

337
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,288
KNOW HOW TO HOLD IT?

338
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,497
Kirito: I GUESS.

339
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,044
IT'S LIGHTER THAN I THOUGHT.

340
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,712
Sinon: THAT'S 'CAUSE
THAT MODEL'S

341
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,631
MADE OF REINFORCED PLASTIC.

342
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,424
THE RECOIL
ISN'T TOO BAD ON IT.

343
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,760
STILL, YOU SHOULD GRIP IT
WITH BOTH HANDS.

344
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,179
AND KEEP YOUR LEFT EYE OPEN.

345
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,430
Kirito: OH, OKAY.

346
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,899
(HEART BEATING)

347
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,902
Sinon: SO RIGHT NOW,
YOU SHOULD BE SEEING

348
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,029
A GREEN CIRCLE
IN YOUR FIELD OF VISION.

349
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,822
Kirito: IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE

350
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,574
SHRINKING AND EXPANDING
LIKE THAT?

351
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,867
Sinon: YEP.

352
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,535
IT'S CALLED
THE BULLET CIRCLE,

353
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,287
YOUR OFFENSIVE ASSIST SYSTEM.

354
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,623
YOUR BULLETS'LL HIT
THE TARGET AT RANDOM

355
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,458
INSIDE THE CIRCLE.

356
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,627
Kirito: HOW DO I BOOST
MY ACCURACY?

357
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,798
Sinon: I GUESS THE EASIEST WAY
IS TO GET CLOSER TO YOUR TARGET.

358
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,257
Kirito: WHAT ELSE?

359
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,926
Sinon: TRY TO STAY CALM.

360
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,844
THE FASTER YOUR HEART BEATS,

361
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,971
THE MORE THE CIRCLE EXPANDS.

362
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,684
Kirito: THIS IS
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

363
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,747
NO WAY.

364
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,165
I MISSED?

365
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,667
Sinon: WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?

366
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,669
IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME.

367
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,673
Kirito: THANK YOU FOR GOING
OUT OF YOUR WAY FOR ME.

368
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,007
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

369
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,301
Sinon: MM‐MMM.
I WAS HAPPY TO HELP.

370
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,970
THERE AREN'T
MANY GIRL PLAYERS HERE.

371
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,806
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING,
SO IT WAS A GOOD WAY

372
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,100
TO KILL SOME TIME
BEFORE THE PRELIMS.

373
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,602
Kirito: WAIT. YOU'RE GONNA
COMPETE IN B. O. B., TOO?

374
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,189
Sinon: UH‐HUH. I WAS
ON MY WAY TO SIGN UP BEFORE...

375
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,025
OH, MY GOD.

376
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,318
THEY'RE CLOSING SOON.

377
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,987
Kirito: REALLY?
I'M SO SORRY.

378
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,613
IT'S MY FAULT WE'RE LATE.

379
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,825
Sinon: NO, IT'S MINE FOR NOT
KEEPING TRACK OF THE TIME.

380
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,034
WHATEVER. LET'S HURRY.

381
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,705
Kirito: WE'RE NEVER
GONNA MAKE IT.

382
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,623
CAN'T WE JUST TELEPORT
OVER THERE?

383
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,418
Sinon: I WISH. THAT ONLY
HAPPENS WHEN YOU RESPAWN

384
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,587
AT A REVIVAL POINT
AFTER YOU DIE.

385
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,465
AND WE CAN'T SUICIDE OURSELVES
TO GET THERE EITHER,

386
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,050
'CAUSE IN TOWN,
OUR H. P. NEVER GOES DOWN.

387
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,304
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS
AT LEAST THREE KILOMETERS AWAY.

388
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,765
IT'S GONNA TAKE US
FIVE MINUTES TO SIGN UP,

389
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,975
SO WE HAVE TO GET THERE
IN THREE.

390
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,895
DON'T CLOSE.

391
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,938
DON'T CLOSE
TILL WE GET THERE.

392
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,612
Kirito: THAT'S IT.

393
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,452
HERE WE GO.

394
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,495
Sinon: (SCREAMS)

395
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,748
Kirito: BETTER HANG ON!

396
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,131
Sinon: WAIT A SEC.

397
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,550
THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
RIDICULOUSLY HARD TO DRIVE.

398
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,594
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
WHO CAN HANDLE 'EM,

399
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,887
SO HOW COME YOU CAN?

400
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:48,603
Kirito: OH, WELL,
I USED TO PLAY

401
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:50,813
A LOT OF RACING GAMES
BACK IN THE DAY.

402
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:55,568
ARE YOU OKAY?

403
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,237
Sinon: (LAUGHS)

404
00:21:57,278 --> 00:21:58,905
YEAH, I'M FINE.

405
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:00,657
THIS IS GREAT.

406
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,534
GO ON. PUNCH IT.

407
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:05,495
THE FASTER, THE BETTER.

408
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:07,121
Kirito: OKAY.
