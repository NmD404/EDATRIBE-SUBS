1
00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:04,266
Nano!

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,516
Nano? Hey, Nano!

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,266
Nano!

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,724
What is it?

5
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:14,766
Are you outside?

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,891
Yes.

7
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:24,432
Nano?

8
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:26,307
Yeah?

9
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,307
Hey, Nano!

10
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:35,141
Huh?

11
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:36,474
Looky, look!

12
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:39,849
I'm a cat, check me-owt!

13
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:41,391
Meow!

14
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,224
Sakamoto! I'm like you!

15
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:45,016
I'm a cat, check me-owt!

16
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:48,516
Check me-owt! See?

17
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:50,391
Hakase.

18
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:54,807
I think your cat look is purr-fect!

19
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:57,349
--Meow? --Hm?

20
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,016
Meow! Checking me-owt?

21
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:01,391
That's paw-some!

22
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:02,432
Here and meow?

23
00:01:02,516 --> 00:01:03,766
So a-mew-sing!

24
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:05,224
You're checking me-owt!

25
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:06,599
I'm really feline it!

26
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:07,766
Meow I'm a cat!

27
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:08,932
You're kitten me!

28
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:10,266
I'm fur-real!

29
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:11,099
Meow you're talkin'!

30
00:01:11,182 --> 00:01:12,849
Meow and fur-ever!

31
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:14,557
It's another peaceful day

32
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,891
at the Shinonome household.

33
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,016
Why is the Earth round?

34
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,849
How do planes and rockets fly?

35
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:05,891
Why do magnets attract and repel one another?

36
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:10,599
Every one of those questions can be answered by science.

37
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:13,974
Our society is infatuated by the afterlife.

38
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:17,099
Things like ghosts, and paranormal phenomena.

39
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:20,349
But such stupid stuff couldn't possibly be real!

40
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:23,391
They can't exist. There's no way.

41
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:29,391
Which is why...

42
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:32,849
...I refuse to believe in psychic mediums!

43
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:38,766
During one of my days off,

44
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,932
I decided to make an eight-hour trek up Mount Osore.

45
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:44,016
And the closer I got to the summit,

46
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,807
the faster my heart raced.

47
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:49,016
Was there really a medium up here?

48
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,474
If there was, then where?

49
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:54,474
What was the point of living in such a secluded place?

50
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:55,766
Maybe if...

51
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:00,516
I found one!

52
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,891
All right, good.

53
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:16,141
I'll say there's a spirit I need channeled.

54
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,057
Excuse me.

55
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:17,974
Yes?

56
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,349
Um.

57
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:21,057
Can you to channel the spirit of Soap?

58
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,141
Yeah, sure.

59
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:24,974
Hello! It's me, Soap!

60
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,891
Brr, ow! Mic test. Check.

61
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:31,807
Check, one, two. Check, check.

62
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:34,016
Testing. One, two, three.

63
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,807
What the--?

64
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:41,682
It feels like something crazy is going on here.

65
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:47,016
Could there actually be somebody
out there with the name Soap?

66
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,766
Testing. Check. One, two.

67
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:52,766
Yes, it's me. I'm Soap. Yup, yup, yup, this is Soap.

68
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:55,057
No. I can't falter now.

69
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:56,599
If I just keep asking her stuff,

70
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:59,849
I'm sure she'll end up contradicting herself somehow.

71
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,349
I have a question.

72
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:04,557
If you're really Soap, then what's your blood type, huh?

73
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,307
Dunno.

74
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:15,141
Let's try again with someone more recognizable.

75
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:16,641
Excuse me.

76
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:20,599
Could you channel the spirit of the great Oda Nobunaga?

77
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:23,182
Give me a break here, would ya?

78
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:29,766
She's refusing my request without even trying?

79
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:32,557
Wait. I'm dealing with an elderly woman here.

80
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,891
She might be overexerting herself.

81
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:37,557
I'll figure out another angle.

82
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,516
Thank you for your time.

83
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,682
I'm gonna go home.

84
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:54,016
I don't like criticizing people.

85
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,724
Realizing that alone makes this trip worth it.

86
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:58,266
Oh, one more thing.

87
00:05:58,349 --> 00:05:59,266
Uh?

88
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:01,224
That'll be 5,000 yen.

89
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,516
Huh...

90
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,391
Oh?

91
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:04,474
Mm. Ah--

92
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,141
Ah-chee.

93
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,724
Wha--?

94
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:19,057
Boys are so weird.

95
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:24,974
Okay, you ready?

96
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:26,807
Rock, paper, scissors!

97
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:39,141
Huh? Wait, what? Huh?

98
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:40,557
Come on, Mai! Wake up!

99
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:42,141
You're supposed to bop me on the head when you win!

100
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:44,766
Didn't I just explain the rules?

101
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:47,016
You're no fun. That hurts, you know?

102
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,432
It hurts more than actually getting smacked.

103
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:52,057
All right. Let's try this again one more time.

104
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:55,099
If you lose, you guard, and if you win, you get to hit.

105
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:57,141
Wah!

106
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:58,724
I didn't mean hit me right this second!

107
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:00,016
Why would you do that?

108
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,682
Because I won the game earlier.

109
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:04,099
That was earlier! You can't do it now!

110
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,516
Act when the time is right! Live in the moment!

111
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,891
Strike when the iron is hot!
Just be spontaneous or whatever!

112
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:16,266
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

113
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:19,641
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

114
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:21,016
You're Nya-no now!

115
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,932
Whatever, let's try it again.

116
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:23,974
Fresh start, okay?

117
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:26,224
Rock, paper, scissors!

118
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,432
She doesn't even care at all!

119
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:31,391
Do you enjoy making me look like a fool?

120
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:33,141
She's so not in the mood.

121
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,016
And now I'm not either.

122
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:40,641
Uh, where do you think you're going?

123
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:42,099
There it is.

124
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:48,016
That statue. Where did... you get that?

125
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:49,266
Carved it.

126
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:50,599
Oh, thank goodness.

127
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:52,182
Here I thought it got reincarnated or something!

128
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,974
I'll put this right here.

129
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:00,057
She looks strangely happy.

130
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,141
Hey, let's forget about that

131
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:04,307
silly statue and keep playing.

132
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:09,266
Kay. Rock, paper, scissors!

133
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:12,849
Uh. I don't think that counts.

134
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:15,141
Okay, maybe it does!

135
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:18,349
Unbelievable. She's so vicious.

136
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,557
I'm begging you, Mai! Please cut it out!

137
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:26,299
Just play by the rules!
And no using that statue as a weapon!

138
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,557
Are you ready now?

139
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:33,974
First comes a rock. One, two, three.

140
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:43,932
Uh.

141
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:51,557
You did it right.

142
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:52,724
That's it!

143
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:54,141
You just played the game!

144
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:56,641
Aw! I knew you could do it all along!

145
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:58,682
Cool! Let's go for another round!

146
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,682
Ready? And first comes a...

147
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,182
...rock.

148
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:06,432
God is dead!

149
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:08,932
God is indeed dead.

150
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:11,141
What gives?

151
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:12,349
Why'd you hit me?

152
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:15,974
We haven't even played the next round yet!

153
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:19,016
Maybe it's because

154
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,141
I don't really feel like playing.

155
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:22,307
Oh.

156
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:30,391
Then can I see your statue thing? Please?

157
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:31,974
Yeah, sure.

158
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:46,099
I'm headed to the library to return some books!

159
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:48,557
Take care of the house while I'm gone!

160
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,599
'Kay!

161
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:54,516
Huh?

162
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:03,807
Why does Nano's daruma guy only
have one eyeball filled in?

163
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:06,682
I know! If I help her out and fix the other eye for her,

164
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,516
I bet she'll really appreciate it!

165
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,974
She'll be so grateful, she might even say that I can eat

166
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:14,307
all the snacks I want, whenever I want!

167
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:32,266
Oh... I think I messed it up,

168
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:35,224
'cause that doesn't look right. Now what do I do?

169
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:37,016
Nano'll get mad, and...

170
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:40,891
Uh! What if she gets so mad she takes my snacks away?!

171
00:11:40,974 --> 00:11:43,432
No more snacks for Hakase ever again!

172
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:50,349
Just put a little this, and a little there, and uh...

173
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:55,516
Is something wrong?

174
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:59,224
Uh! I don't know what to do Sakamoto! Look.

175
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:00,724
At what? Whoa!

176
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:04,891
What happened to its face? You did a number on that thing.

177
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,391
I was just trying to even out the eyes.

178
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:12,266
Hmm...

179
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:18,891
Don't you worry. I know what we have to do.

180
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,516
I'm home!

181
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,057
Gah!

182
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:36,057
You're on your own.

183
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:38,474
Sakamoto!

184
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,932
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

185
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:43,141
Hey, Hakase!

186
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:44,557
Sorry I took so long,

187
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:47,182
but I was picking out new books to bring home.

188
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,849
What'd you do while I was gone?

189
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:49,724
Wait, what the--?!

190
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:52,349
What's going on with your belly?

191
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:55,307
Well, uh. You know how it goes sometimes.

192
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,391
What does that even mean?

193
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:01,266
It's coming!

194
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:02,807
Wait.

195
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,807
There's no way. You can't possibly be having a child.

196
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:07,307
I'm having one now! The baby is coming!

197
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:10,516
O... kay? Are you pulling some sort of prank?

198
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:14,307
I'm not! I'm bringing your baby brother into the world!

199
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:36,224
It's your baby brother.

200
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:39,224
Goo-goo. Ga-ga.

201
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:41,141
This could be a problem.

202
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:48,307
Helvetica Standard.

203
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,974
Mio! You wanna play a game?

204
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:31,182
What kind?

205
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,349
How 'bout we play Kokkuri?

206
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:34,599
What's that?

207
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,932
Wait. You've never heard of it before?

208
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:38,307
Nope, never.

209
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:41,141
Okay then, I'm gonna break it down for you.

210
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:42,849
You start by drawing a shrine gate

211
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:44,432
at the top of the paper here.

212
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,391
Then you write Yes and No on the
sides, and the alphabet below.

213
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,141
Okay.

214
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,182
And in some regions, I think you're supposed to draw

215
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,766
a little piece of fried tofu somewhere

216
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,891
on the paper too, but...

217
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:59,474
Let's stick to the simplified version for now.

218
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:01,349
Then. You have to make sure to open up

219
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:05,432
a north facing entrance so the spirits can get inside.

220
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:07,307
Next, we take a ten-yen coin

221
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:10,099
and set it on top of the gate we drew at the beginning.

222
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:12,307
Finally, we both touch the coin with our fingers

223
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:13,932
and ask it a question.

224
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,349
There's no restriction on what kind of things you can ask

225
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,682
the spirit, so the sky's basically the limit here.

226
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:19,849
Sure.

227
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:21,474
And then, without any effort of our own,

228
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:23,682
spirits will slide the coin around and spell out

229
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,891
the answers to our questions for us.

230
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,307
Really?

231
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:30,307
Yeah! I know it's awesome, but some things are taboo.

232
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,682
First off, you can't play the game by yourself

233
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,266
and you can't half-ass it.

234
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:37,057
Because if you do, you might get possessed!

235
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:37,680
Oh?

236
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,474
You also risk getting possessed
if you stop partway through,

237
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,016
so you gotta commit.

238
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:43,391
Right, I get it.

239
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,557
Now you know how to play the wonderfully spooky game

240
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:48,599
of Kokkuri! So, whaddaya say we give it a shot?

241
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,182
Nah, I'm good.

242
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:53,099
Ahhhh....

243
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:08,224
So, uh, that concludes the lessons

244
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:10,141
I have for you today.

245
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:12,307
Remember that we'll be having a quiz tomorrow,

246
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:14,432
so make sure you don't forget to study tonight!

247
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,599
What? Can't you push the quiz back?

248
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:18,641
It doesn't matter if you take it later,

249
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:20,057
you're still gonna bomb it.

250
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:22,932
Yeah, probably.

251
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,974
Excuse me, Miss Sakurai?

252
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,807
How can I help you, Miss Aioi?

253
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:29,391
I just had a question for you, if you don't mind.

254
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:30,891
Go ahead!

255
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:34,682
Well, about that English test we had a little while ago.

256
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:36,849
What is this supposed to be?

257
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:39,432
The correct answer for that one was "Fly."

258
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:41,557
No, I'm not asking about the answer.

259
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:43,599
I'm wondering if you were the one who drew this

260
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:45,057
low-level looking monster.

261
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:48,099
Yes, I did. I figured it would help make the test

262
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:50,807
a little easier if there was a visual aid.

263
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:53,766
Well then, you have some pretty awesome drawings!

264
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,099
How kind of you. But my drawings aren't great,

265
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,557
so I'm sorry if they were hard to identify.

266
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,891
Uhh...

267
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,182
I know!

268
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:02,724
How about I give you a hand,

269
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:05,391
and draw you a picture that you can put on the next exam!

270
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,432
I promise it'll be something really cool!

271
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:08,807
Sure, okay!

272
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:10,182
Oh! Hey, Mio!

273
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:11,641
Hm?

274
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:14,016
Check it out! My drawing is gonna be in the next test!

275
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,307
Really? Why?

276
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,349
The teacher said she would use it!

277
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:18,891
I bet you could get yours on there too

278
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:21,057
if you drew a little doodle of your own right now.

279
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,182
Yeah, I dunno if I'm cut out for something like that.

280
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,099
Huh. What do mean?

281
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:27,641
I'm just not the greatest.

282
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:30,557
And besides, I gotta go return this thing.

283
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:32,516
If you say so! 'Kay!

284
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,641
I think I'm gonna draw a cool-looking dude!

285
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:46,182
Get a load of this handsome stud!

286
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:49,932
Wow! He looks so cool!

287
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,516
That's impressive!

288
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,891
I'd say you've got quite the artistic talent there!

289
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,224
Aw, well it's not that amazing.

290
00:17:57,307 --> 00:18:00,182
Oh wait, maybe it is.

291
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:05,182
I think I'm gonna name my dapper
doodle dude Hubbu Hunkerson.

292
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,599
Wow! That's such a cool name!

293
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,141
None of this is cool!

294
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:20,349
I dunno guys, I think it should look more like this.

295
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,099
--Feast your eyes! --Edgy!

296
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:27,474
Wow, amazing! It looks like it's from a manga!

297
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,057
You must put a lot of time and effort

298
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,016
into practicing your art skills.

299
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:33,016
Well, uh, just a little!

300
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:35,599
Remarkable! Show me some of your other work!

301
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,682
Uh. I don't think so.

302
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,057
Oh? But why not?

303
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,474
I would love to see more of your stuff.

304
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,557
Um. Well. It's just...

305
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,349
Gimme that thing!

306
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:49,932
My drawing is way cooler than yours, see?

307
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,557
You straight-up copied me!

308
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:56,849
You don't know that.

309
00:18:56,932 --> 00:18:58,266
I saw you do it!

310
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,516
"Homage" may be the word you're looking for.

311
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,307
So you're admitting that you copied?!

312
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,307
Wow! That's so cool!

313
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:06,224
You are so easy to please!

314
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:17,766
All right, then, prepare yourselves for some of this!

315
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,599
Glasses! Every girl swoons over the cool

316
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,932
and collected demeanor behind those lenses!

317
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,891
Ah, so he wears glasses.

318
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:30,349
Huh?

319
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:31,891
Is his eyesight bad?

320
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:34,391
He'd probably look better if he wore contacts.

321
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:37,599
You two don't understand anything!

322
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:39,557
Y'know? I'll add an extra bit!

323
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:40,641
There we go!

324
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:42,557
They're hanging under his ears!

325
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,557
You so stole my glasses idea!

326
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,932
Tch. Tch. Tch. They're sunglasses.

327
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:48,724
Wow! They're so cool!

328
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,349
Are you kidding me?!

329
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:52,391
Oh, yeah? Then how's this?

330
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,307
A butler! The perfect gentleman

331
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:56,599
who serves you tea and follows your every command!

332
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:58,432
He'll treat you like the fine young lady you are!

333
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:00,266
Huh. Glasses again?

334
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,682
I don't think I understand the appeal.

335
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:06,099
Maybe you should have taken my contacts idea.

336
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,807
I feel like you're a bit out of touch, Mio. Tell ya what.

337
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:16,016
I'll show you what being cool is really all about.

338
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,974
Some of this, and some of that.

339
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:18,891
Check it.

340
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:21,682
It's floating!

341
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:25,391
Wait! Hold on a sec! Is he supposed to be driving?

342
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,016
Wow! He's so fast and dangerous!

343
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:31,599
You've gotta be kidding me!

344
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:34,057
They don't understand coolness at all!

345
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:39,182
You wanna see something cool? Then I'll have to show you.

346
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,266
This is a lesson now.

347
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:44,432
You're gonna see what true coolness really is!

348
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:48,391
You'll see! You'll all see!

349
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:51,807
This is the coolest!

350
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:52,682
Yo.

351
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:53,766
Uh...

352
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:55,057
Uh...

353
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:03,224
Oh, no.

354
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,766
I'm just kidding!

355
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,807
I kid!

356
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:38,099
I drew this while listening to jazz.

357
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:44,974
Good morning!

358
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:48,182
Oh. Oh, good morning, all knowing master.

359
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,474
Don't you even!

360
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:50,682
Listen up class!

361
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,307
It's time for this morning's quiz,

362
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,641
so take one and pass it down, please.

363
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:56,474
Aw man, this sucks.

364
00:21:56,557 --> 00:21:58,891
I was hoping that I could keep my drawing skills a secret

365
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:03,307
for a while longer, and then I had to go overboard.

366
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:07,099
All things considered, after going berserk like that,

367
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:10,474
I should be relieved that what I
drew ended up as tame as it was.

368
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:14,057
I guess I should count myself lucky.

369
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:16,266
But I'm sure I won't hear the end of it from Yuuko,

370
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:19,016
at least for the next few days. That's okay, though!

371
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:22,016
I gotta look on the bright side! And stay positive!

372
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,349
Yo.

373
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:27,182
Hurry up and pass it back.

374
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:28,307
Uhh.

375
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,974
Ready, and... begin!

376
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,307
Yoink! Bang! Zoom!

377
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:13,849
Hello! It's nice to meet you!

378
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:15,307
I'm an Onomatopoeia!

379
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:17,516
Cock-a-doodle-doo! Now you try it!

380
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,057
But don't chicken out!

381
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:22,099
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 6.

382
00:24:22,182 --> 00:24:23,599
Look forward to it!
