1
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:05,325
Oh, yeah, don't worry.

2
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:06,533
It's cool. See you!

3
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:08,908
Hey, Mai, do you wanna walk home together?

4
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:10,950
Can we stop by the fire station?

5
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,450
Stop by what?

6
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,908
Why would a pair of ordinary high school girls go there?

7
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:20,116
I know what we can do!

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
How 'bout we go and visit

9
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,116
that Daiku Coffee place on the way home.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,866
But their sizing system is kinda weird,

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,491
so don't feel too bad if you get confused

12
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:29,033
by the names and stuff.

13
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,575
Got 'em.

14
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:32,616
I've been there before, so I can help walk you through it.

15
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:50,700
Mai. Something's... afoot.

16
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:54,241
I'm stepping up my game.

17
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:57,075
Uh, yeah, I can see that! I just can't understand why!

18
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,991
Is this some sort of fashion statement or what?

19
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:01,950
It's just a joke.

20
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:08,991
She really threw me for a loop there.

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,075
It's happened. Mai's completely lost her mind.

22
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:18,533
I don't even know what to say anymore!

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,616
Oh, well. I'll just see what happens, I guess.

24
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:05,908
I wonder... What I should make for dinner tonight?

25
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,283
Green onions are on sale today,

26
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:13,158
so maybe I can do something with those.

27
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:17,033
Wait, no. Hakase hates onions.

28
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:26,575
Nano! Nano! Nano!

29
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,950
Hey. Look. I caught this crow outside.

30
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,616
Caught a what?

31
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,491
Wait! You can't bring that in here!

32
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:39,616
It's dangerous, and it might carry diseases or something!

33
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,200
Nah. It's fine.

34
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:43,366
Oh, I have an idea.

35
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:49,366
It's not in here.

36
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:06,491
I might die in here.

37
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,116
It's not in here either.

38
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,866
How could I have misplaced my scarf?

39
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:25,991
Greetings. I am Crow.

40
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,450
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

41
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:29,866
Say what?!

42
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,366
I'm so surprised by how polite and considerate he is.

43
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,366
Well, yeah, he's a crow.

44
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,658
You are too kind. It is an honor.

45
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,700
Do you think crows can drink strawberry juice?

46
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,116
Huh. Good question.

47
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,033
We should try giving him some! It'll be neat!

48
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,408
Oh, wow.

49
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:55,825
He's nice enough to kill bugs for us!

50
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:58,783
It was nothing. I simply did what I felt was right.

51
00:04:58,866 --> 00:04:59,825
What a good crow.

52
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,908
Oh, hey.

53
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:05,991
What happened to that scarf you always wear, Sakamoto?

54
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:08,116
You're so silly!

55
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,033
We can't understand you and your cat speak!

56
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:11,825
Allow me to translate.

57
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:18,241
Ah, yes. I see.

58
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:22,866
It appears he's upset because
he would like to wear my scarf.

59
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,075
Ah, I see.

60
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,783
It's my scarf in the first place!

61
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:39,408
Hakase, did you take your scarf invention

62
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,783
from Sakamoto and put it on the nice crow?

63
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,616
This is quite a predicament.

64
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,033
Did you stop to think about how
that might make Sakamoto feel?

65
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,783
I know! I'll make him something!

66
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,033
Excellent idea.

67
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:54,991
It's done!

68
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:56,575
This is Biscuit #1!

69
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:58,491
You are not helping!

70
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,033
I must inquire.

71
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:03,491
What exactly is this "Biscuit #1" of yours capable of?

72
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:05,658
I'm very glad you inquired, Crow.

73
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,533
He comes with a rocket punch feature!

74
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,033
Here, I'll show you!

75
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:13,241
Three, two, one. Blast off!

76
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,575
Hang on. Shouldn't we be helping Sakamoto?

77
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:25,741
What about his scarf?

78
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,200
Sure, but check this out.

79
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:29,825
Let's see what power the left hand is packin'!

80
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:33,033
Three, two, one! And launch!

81
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:40,908
I'll kill you. I'll kill you all.

82
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,366
Well. Ha. This day has been quite entertaining.

83
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,908
But I believe my mischief has overstayed its welcome.

84
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:51,866
It is about time that this scarf was returned

85
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,866
to its rightful owner.

86
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,366
Though it was short-lived,

87
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,283
I enjoyed being able to communicate with you humans.

88
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,491
Mr. Crow.

89
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:01,700
You should stay with us!

90
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:02,783
Wait!

91
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:09,408
I hope for our paths to cross again one day!

92
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:12,158
Until then, I bid you farewell.

93
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:16,408
See you again!

94
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:19,158
Goodbye, Mr. Crow!

95
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:20,783
Crow.

96
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,575
He took my freakin' scarf!

97
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,450
There's no way, Chief. It's impossible.

98
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,575
No, trust me on this. Everything will be fine.

99
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:37,825
Yeah, but--

100
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:39,825
But what? You don't believe in me?

101
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:43,658
Of course not! I just, uh...

102
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:46,408
Chief. You can always count on me to have your back!

103
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:49,533
Perfect. Then allow me to have yours as well.

104
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,616
Huh? Wait!

105
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:56,825
Well? How does it feel?

106
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,783
Come on, use your words.

107
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:18,283
Yesterday, I dug a few pitfalls behind the gym

108
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:21,241
and filled them with a powerful adhesive.

109
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,700
And with this letter,

110
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,741
I shall lure her in to my scientifically crafted trap!

111
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,325
Prepare yourself, Nano Shinonome.

112
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:30,991
Today is the day.

113
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:48,491
She's here!

114
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:49,783
Gotcha!

115
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,116
Fascinating.

116
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,491
Who would've thought that Ms. Sakurai

117
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,783
had a little brother at this school.

118
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:23,366
Maybe I could find out more about her

119
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,783
through this brother of hers.

120
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:35,283
This kid. He can play Go+Soccer?!

121
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,241
Interesting.

122
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,116
'Scuse me, young man.

123
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,866
Yeah?

124
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,450
I was wondering: You don't happen to have

125
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,616
a boyfriend, do you?

126
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,866
You idiot! What is wrong with me?

127
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,408
Why am I like this? Why am I so stupid?

128
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:55,033
A boyfriend? No, I don't, but...

129
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:56,783
No, I don't, but...

130
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:01,075
Sprout. Sprout. Sprouting!

131
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:03,366
Wait! No, it's not! Nothing's sprouting at all!

132
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,741
Uh...

133
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:05,950
Sorry about that!

134
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:08,408
Just, uh, forget about what I said. Ha-ha.

135
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:12,075
Anyway, I see that you, uh, know how to play Go+Soccer?

136
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:14,741
Yeah, and I'm pretty good, too.

137
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:17,241
By the way, Mr. Takasaki.

138
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:19,408
You have a crush on my big sister, don't you?

139
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,533
Uh.

140
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:26,700
What?! Don't be ridiculous!

141
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,908
I'm just making small talk

142
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:29,908
with a fellow Go+Soccer player, that's all!

143
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:31,950
Hold on. You know how to play Go+Soccer, too?

144
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:33,450
Oh, yeah!

145
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:36,575
You're looking at the former high school MVP right here!

146
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,825
You know, the Go+Soccer club at this school

147
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:41,158
doesn't actually have an advisor yet.

148
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,366
I'll tell you what-- sign on as our club advisor

149
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,033
and I'll see if I can help you score some points

150
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:47,283
with my sister.

151
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:50,116
No, what makes you think that I would ever care

152
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,533
about something like that?

153
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:53,116
If you don't do it, then I'll tell everybody in school

154
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
that you have a thing for her,

155
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:55,700
and it'll get real awkward for you.

156
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:57,158
Uh! Blackmail?

157
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:59,991
How 'bout it? Sounds like a good deal to me.

158
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:01,283
Well.

159
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:02,700
What's it gonna be?

160
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:07,158
It's just, being a club advisor, it's kind of a hassle.

161
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,283
Hey, everyone!

162
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,575
You'll never believe what I found out!

163
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,700
He's doing it? I have to stop him!

164
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:14,200
There you are!

165
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:16,533
Nakanojou fell into a hole filled with glue behind the gym

166
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,741
and now he can't get out!

167
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:18,991
Wha--?!

168
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,783
We need your help, like, right now!

169
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:23,700
Hey! Who wants to hear some dirt on Mr. Takasaki?

170
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:24,783
Sir!

171
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,450
All right, then. Listen closely.

172
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,491
Okay.

173
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:35,950
Nakanojou...

174
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,033
...is totally okay!

175
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:38,200
Wha--?!

176
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,700
Maybe he's pretending to be a golf ball!

177
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:41,200
Wha--?!

178
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:43,033
So is that why somebody shaved all of his hair off, then?

179
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,408
Wha--?! Draw it in.

180
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:45,991
Wha--?! I can try.

181
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,325
Wha--?! Hang on!

182
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:48,491
Wha--?!

183
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:50,158
First help me with this!

184
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,450
He likes green tea.

185
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,950
Stopping a student from blabbing about

186
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,866
a teacher's private life is just as important

187
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,325
as a student that needs to be excavated!

188
00:15:58,408 --> 00:16:00,991
Because, well, I'm a teacher!

189
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:02,200
Mr. Takasaki!

190
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:02,908
What?!

191
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:04,741
I kept my mouth shut!

192
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:07,908
I'll be waiting for you, club advisor.

193
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:12,033
That's a good call, my dude.

194
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:13,158
Annaka, let's bounce!

195
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:14,325
'Kay!

196
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,200
There's no time to waste.

197
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:19,033
After all, I'm a teacher!

198
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:20,408
It's this way!

199
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:21,991
One sec.

200
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:28,200
Even though I always thought his hair was weird,

201
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:31,158
I do feel kinda bad for shaving it off.

202
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,908
So...

203
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,783
I guess I should dig him out.

204
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,783
He doesn't know I set the trap in the first place,

205
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,575
so it should be fine.

206
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,825
What's this? What's going on?

207
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:45,116
Where am I?

208
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,741
This feels weird! I don't like it! I'm stuck!

209
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:50,366
Anyone? Uh. Please?

210
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,116
My hair.

211
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:55,825
Run away!

212
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,075
My hair!

00:16:58,158 --> 00:16:59,950

What the heck?!

219
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,575
Help me!

220
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:32,408
What the heck?

221
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:33,616
Help me!

222
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,950
My hair!

223
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:35,741
--What the heck? --Help me!

224
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:38,241
What happened here?

225
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,575
--Help me! --My hair.

226
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,450
--Help me! --What the what?

227
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,325
Oh, my. That was a close one.

228
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:46,116
What's with the hole? That's just dangerous.

229
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,283
--Help me! --My hair.

230
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,075
I'm heading out!

231
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,908
This is it.

232
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,408
I won't call out Mai's jokes today!

233
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:13,325
It's like she's practically begging me

234
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:14,700
to make jabs at her.

235
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,200
She just lobs 'em up, and I can't stop myself

236
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:19,283
from knocking 'em out of the park!

237
00:18:21,908 --> 00:18:23,616
But if I don't cut it out now,

238
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,991
we're gonna get stuck in some
weird, never-ending joke cycle!

239
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,950
We're just normal high school girls

240
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:32,658
living our ordinary high school lives.

241
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:34,450
At least we're supposed to be.

242
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:37,866
But the way we act is anything but ordinary.

243
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:42,825
But starting today, that's all gonna change.

244
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:46,575
My resolve is like a diamond,
and this diamond is unbreakable!

245
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,033
Hey. Good morning, Yuuko.

246
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,241
Hey! How's it going?

247
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,283
Double glasses!

248
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,533
This is harder than I thought!

249
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,533
She really brought her A game today!

250
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:59,241
It's almost like she's testing me!

251
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:00,908
But I won't give in!

252
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,033
I can--no, I will change!

253
00:19:05,158 --> 00:19:07,783
Hello, Mai! <i>Selamat pagi</i> !

254
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:09,241
Perfect.

255
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,950
And now's my chance to start an ordinary conversation.

256
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:13,491
Oh, yeah, I was wondering:

257
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:16,200
Did you see yesterday's Muscle Theater show?

258
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:23,116
Wha--? Wait, am I supposed to choose?

259
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:28,866
Where are my glasses?

260
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:33,033
It's just one gag after another with her today!

261
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:35,700
And the more I ignore them, the more she does it!

262
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,533
But I can't give in! I have to stay strong!

263
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:41,033
Don't take the bait!

264
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:42,116
What's up with you, Mai?

265
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,408
You've got two pairs of glasses on!

266
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:47,033
How dare you, Tanaka! I wanted to call her out!

267
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,033
The one thing in this world that I wanted

268
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:52,450
and you took it away from me!

269
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,825
Ah! Wait! No, this is a good thing!

270
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:57,033
It might just help me not make fun of her!

271
00:19:57,116 --> 00:19:58,366
Wait, hold on.

272
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,991
What class do we have for first period today?

273
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,200
No idea!

274
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,700
But did you hear that Ms. Nakamura tripped

275
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:05,575
and fell the other day?

276
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:08,533
No. I hope she's okay.

277
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:09,908
Wait, hold on.

278
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,450
What class do we have for first period today?

279
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:13,950
Uh, didn't you just ask--?

280
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,158
Shut your mouth, me!

281
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:17,116
That was so sneaky, I almost didn't notice!

282
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,741
She's changing up her tactics
to try and catch me off guard!

283
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:22,366
Crafty, Mai. Very crafty.

284
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,033
All right, who's on day duty today?

285
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:27,658
Stand. Bow.

286
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,908
Take your sheet.

287
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:35,200
Okay, let's get started with class. Everyone...

288
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:36,616
"Take your sheet"?

289
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,491
Are you freaking kidding me with this?

290
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,908
And nobody even called her out on it!

291
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,283
Now then, who would like to read this section?

292
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,533
Me.

293
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,741
Of course she would!

294
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,158
Sure, now go ahead.

295
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:52,450
Right.

296
00:20:58,408 --> 00:20:59,825
"A peaceful shade enveloped the mountain"...

297
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:01,283
She's reading it!

298
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:03,366
She's saying the words!

299
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,450
"It was my first time there"...

300
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,991
She's saying them perfectly.

301
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:10,575
Which means... that she...

302
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:19,200
She memorized it!

303
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:41,866
You know what?

304
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,200
Calling someone out...

305
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:49,991
...it feels...

306
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:57,450
...so darn good!

307
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:11,450
I apologize for shouting randomly.

308
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,075
I'll be in the hallway.

309
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:17,325
Oh. Okay.

310
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:21,200
So... this is how it is.

311
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:24,491
Maybe things don't have to change.

312
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:25,950
Because...

313
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,825
This is the path that we chose together.

314
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:33,700
Yuuko.

315
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:37,658
This entire time...

316
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:39,366
...I had contacts on.

317
00:22:45,283 --> 00:22:47,283
Very well played, my friend!

318
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,116
Hm?

319
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:09,450
Wake up, Hakase. You shouldn't sleep here.

320
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,866
You should crawl into bed or you might catch a cold, okay?

321
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:16,408
Are you listening to me?

322
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:17,908
Gimme a little longer.

323
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:20,825
Huh? Longer for what?

324
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:24,200
That's what!

325
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,241
Sakamoto, you should really go to your bed, too, y'know.

326
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:10,033
Uh. Sure.

327
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:15,700
In the end, she had to be carried.

328
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,741
I'm the three of spades!

329
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:21,950
My number may be low, but don't count me out!

330
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:23,575
The deck may be stacked against me, too,

331
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:25,116
but that's not a deal breaker!

332
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,700
This spade is my strong suit, after all!

333
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:30,783
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 18!

334
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,075
Look forward to it!
