1
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:31,723
Hm?

2
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:33,788
I've brought him, sir.

3
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:35,079
Enter.

4
00:00:41,222 --> 00:00:43,871
Why, if it isn't the great King Albert.

5
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:51,954
Why you...

6
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:56,038
Tell me, what's the meaning of this, Dolph?

7
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,246
Oh, calm yourself.

8
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,746
I simply hoped we could enjoy a meal together.

9
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:07,246
Well, that's a shame.

10
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,579
It seems as though there is no more food left for you.

11
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:17,579
Restrain him.

12
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:18,579
Sir.

13
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:27,329
Huh...

14
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:29,246
So that's what you were after?!

15
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:35,996
Now, what do you say we end this game of hide-and-seek

16
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,413
with that princess of yours, King Albert?

17
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:43,204
Well? Your Majesty?

18
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:55,538
Did you find her?

19
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,746
Negative!

20
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:58,163
I'll check this section.

21
00:01:58,246 --> 00:01:59,621
Listen closely, men!

22
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,496
We're only after the wooden cube!

23
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,496
Try not to kill the princess!

24
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:06,954
Don't think for a single moment you'll

25
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:09,121
get away with this, Dolph. Hear me?

26
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:11,871
I already have.

27
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:15,788
I'm afraid nobody has the power to stop me at this point.

28
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,329
You're out of allies, and out of luck.

29
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:20,788
What a shame. Right, Albert?

30
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:25,371
Thank you for this little globetrotting trip

31
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:28,829
of yours. It was the most perfect opportunity

32
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:30,621
you could have given me.

33
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:32,413
With the help of my subordinates,

34
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:34,579
I was able to trap you and the princess!

35
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:37,788
But why? What brought upon this betrayal?

36
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:43,496
It looks like you still don't understand at all.

37
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,954
I'm grateful for everything you've done.

38
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:48,954
Raising an orphan like me as one of your own,

39
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:52,704
and even appointing me as the commander of your kingdom.

40
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:54,413
I don't understand.

41
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,496
Are you really this foolish?

42
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,538
It's because I have my own ambitions.

43
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,538
This is the kind of divine punishment that you deserve.

44
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:12,163
Accept it.

45
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:12,996
Lord Dolph!

46
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:13,829
Huh?

47
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:15,288
We've located the princess!

48
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,163
Okay! Let's boogie!

49
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:18,371
Excuse me.

50
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:19,829
Take this time to think carefully

51
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:22,329
about your dying words, won't you?

52
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:23,413
King Albert.

53
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:26,454
You filthy traitor!

54
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,204
What do you think you're doing?!

55
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,246
Have you all completely lost your minds?

56
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,913
Well, if it isn't Princess Starla herself.

57
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:35,204
It's so good to see you.

58
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,121
Dolph, you bastard!

59
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:40,288
You have no freakin' idea what you've done, do you?

60
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:43,079
What a shame to ruin

61
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,621
that pretty face with such a dirty mouth.

62
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:47,788
Of course I know what I've done.

63
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:51,038
I've taken King Albert's precious wooden cube.

64
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:53,746
And once I get my hands on your cube as well,

65
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,329
I'll be able to revive the ancient weapon.

66
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:58,246
Then I'll finally be able to ascend

67
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,871
as the new King of the Fey Kingdom!

68
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:04,413
Struggle all you wish, but no one will save you.

69
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,246
There's nowhere to run anymore!

70
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,246
Now, hand it over peacefully and I might let you live!

71
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:38,538
Whoa. Dolph is dead!

72
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:57,746
Hurrah! All hail the Princess, hurrah!

73
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:01,413
All hail the princess, hurrah!
All hail the princess, hurrah!

74
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:02,329
All hail...

75
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:03,413
...the princess! Hurrah!

76
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:05,288
All hail the princess, hurrah!

77
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,038
All hail the princess, hurrah!

78
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:10,829
All hail the princess, hurrah!

79
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:17,829
All hail the princess, hurrah...

80
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:18,663
You bastards!

81
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:21,829
You guys all owe me big time!

82
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:27,079
Now, then! Bring me to my father right away!

83
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,871
Hm? Wait a sec.

84
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:42,871
Isn't this the item the princess was protecting earlier?

85
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:45,621
Yeah, then that must mean...

86
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:55,704
Uh? Wait... what?!

87
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,746
Then, that means...

88
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:00,954
I could have the power to be king!

89
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,579
No, hang on, let's not get crazy here.

90
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,829
Man, I could really use a cigarette.

91
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:12,204
After 12 long years of service,

92
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,079
I honestly thought I would live out

93
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:16,788
the rest of my life as a soldier.

94
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:20,579
But now... To have a chance like this...

95
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,788
I could never.

96
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:45,079
I have no reason to become king.

97
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:47,454
I wouldn't know what to do if I did.

98
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:49,704
And even with both cubes in my possession,

99
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:53,204
I couldn't revive that ancient weapon if I tried.

100
00:06:56,704 --> 00:07:03,954
No!

101
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:14,246
Wha--?!

102
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:20,871
What a beautiful morning.

103
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:26,746
All right! I won! I think?

104
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,204
I did! Awesome!

105
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:30,121
Check it out! I just won a 100,000 yen

106
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:31,579
in this lottery prize thing!

107
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:34,538
Really?! You gonna treat me to a cut of that or what?

108
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,829
I don't even know what to treat myself with first!

109
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:39,829
What do I even buy? Like a car or a house or something?

110
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:41,538
Hang on a sec.

111
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:44,288
This, uh, is from last year.

112
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,579
Uhh...

113
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:59,079
Don't sweat it, the lottery is almost impossible to win,

114
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:00,371
so it's fine.

115
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:02,663
I know, but it still breaks my heart.

116
00:08:02,746 --> 00:08:03,996
Don't be like that.

117
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,579
You shouldn't be so down on your birthday, so here!

118
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:11,288
Huh? For real? A present? Thanks so much!

119
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:14,579
Can I open it now?

120
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,538
Mm-hm. It's really nothing special.

121
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,704
Just something that I had laying around the house.

122
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:20,871
I'm sure it's great! A gift is a gift!

123
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,871
It's the thought that counts!

124
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:31,246
Miss Sakurai?

125
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:32,996
Huh?

126
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,579
Oh, Mr. Takasaki! How are you this morning?

127
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:39,038
I'm fine, thank you. So, um...

128
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:41,329
What are you gonna do about that Aioi kid?

129
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,996
She never even attempts to do her assigned homework.

130
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:46,538
Oh, uh! I, uh... I'm sorry!

131
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:49,621
I think a nice, stern lecture
from her teacher-slash-counselor

132
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:50,663
would help set her straight.

133
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:52,746
Uh, sure. I can try.

134
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,663
I'll see if there's something I can do for her.

135
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:59,538
Now if you'll please excuse me, I have a class.

136
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:01,038
I'm counting on you!

137
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:02,829
Excuse me.

138
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:06,829
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

139
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,413
I didn't spill any on you, did I?

140
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,079
No, no, I'm perfectly fine.

141
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:12,204
Don't worry about it!

142
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:15,329
I just want to protect her!

143
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:17,538
In my 26 years on this Earth,

144
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:20,538
I've always had absolutely no luck with women.

145
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:23,079
But now, feelings for her have sprouted

146
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,663
like a surprise bamboo shoot in the garden.

147
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,204
No, I can't! I'm a professional!

148
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:31,788
There's no room for romance in the workplace!

149
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,496
I have to pull myself together!

150
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,829
Hm? Huh. Is that...?

151
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:45,454
Miss Sakurai!

152
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:46,746
Hm?

153
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,579
Wait, you forgot your black folder.

154
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:51,663
Oh, thank you so much Mr. Takasaki.

155
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:54,663
Uh. But I have my materials right here.

156
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:55,496
Uh.

157
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:56,996
Mr. Takasaki!

158
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,913
Where do you think you're taking my folder?

159
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:01,371
Uh! M-My apologies.

160
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:04,788
Heh! Well then, I have to get going.

161
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:14,746
I wish I could take her mushroom picking!

162
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:18,121
Come to think of it... Does she have a boyfriend?

163
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:20,371
She doesn't wear a ring,

164
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,663
so I can assume that she isn't married.

165
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,996
Does that mean I might still have a chance with her?

166
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,038
I don't even know what kind of music she likes!

167
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:29,871
What's her favorite animal? And favorite sport?

168
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:30,913
And vegetable?

169
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:33,496
Ah! What am I thinking?

170
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,079
Be gone, impure thoughts! I can't be a role-model

171
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:41,038
to the students if I let my mind wander like this!

172
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:44,913
Ah, Mr. Takasaki! Let me guess,

173
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:48,038
you're having trouble with some of your students.

174
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,871
But you know, it should be fine

175
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:51,871
to ask what her favorite food is.

176
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:55,038
Hey, Miss Sakurai, what's your favorite thing to eat?

177
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,288
Um, I like a bit of everything.

178
00:10:57,371 --> 00:10:59,163
Ha, ha, ha! Is that so?

179
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:01,121
How do you feel about shiitake mushrooms?

180
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:02,496
They're great grilled or boiled!

181
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,621
That's true. And fried too, right?

182
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:08,454
Of course! Fried is perfectly okay!

183
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:10,746
I bet those would be pretty tasty.

184
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,621
Yeah, I got this!

185
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:15,621
Just act natural. It'll be fine if I just talk normally.

186
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:17,829
Like if I'm talking to eggplants or something.

187
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:19,621
Nice and calm.

188
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:21,454
Miss Sakurai?

189
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:23,788
Yes? How may I help you now?

190
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:27,996
I'm sorry for bothering you so suddenly like this.

191
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,496
I was just wondering if you
have a boyfriend at the moment.

192
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,038
What the hell am I saying?!

193
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:37,663
I'm a fool! A complete idiot! An absolute moron!

194
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:40,246
Nope! Um. I'm single.

195
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:44,288
Single... Single... Single...

196
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,121
Single... Single... Single...

197
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:48,913
Sprout! Sprout!

198
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:53,454
Sprout! Sprouting!

199
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,954
Um, Mr. Takasaki?

200
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:58,746
I'm so sorry if that was too forward!

201
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,288
It worked out all right!

202
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:02,913
And I wish you the best of luck

203
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:04,996
with your next class, Miss Sakurai.

204
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:08,954
Thank you! I wish you the same as well, Mr. Takasaki.

205
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:10,413
Thanks.

206
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,704
Right, excuse me then. I'll see you later!

207
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:16,663
I wish you the same as well.

208
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:19,663
I wish you the same as well...

209
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:28,163
Well, I see that you're in good spirits today.

210
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:31,621
Helvetica Standard.

211
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:33,538
Wait! Please!

212
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:36,038
Give me back my sickle!

213
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,246
If I don't pawn off this sickle for food,

214
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:39,996
I'll die from starvation!

215
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,913
Oh no, a dead end!

216
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:49,204
Well, I'll be.

217
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:51,413
Please give it back to me!

218
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,079
Oh, man!

219
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,746
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

220
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:03,288
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

221
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,454
Wow! I won!

222
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:13,371
Oh hey, thanks!

223
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:14,704
And that's not all!

224
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:15,871
Add the coconut milk.

225
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:17,079
For tomorrow's forecast.

226
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,371
Miracle's in a pinch!

227
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:20,788
But I've got more where that came from!

228
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,246
Hey, I bet you I can name something that you've

229
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,329
never ever, ever thought about before in your entire life!

230
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:54,579
Sure, go ahead.

231
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:57,329
A quirky office lady's travel diary!

232
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,288
I have a bit.

233
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:01,538
Uhh...

234
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:05,954
Hurry!

235
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,788
Looks like the train is gonna leave at any second!

236
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:09,871
Wait! Hang on!

237
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,371
All right! We're in!

238
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:12,621
Safe!

239
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:15,996
You're the only one who made it.

240
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:24,746
<i>Selamat tinggal</i> .

241
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:29,246
Right. Um. Let's keep those orders coming in.

242
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:30,579
Yellowtail, and a Hamachi!

243
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,871
Let's keep those orders coming in.

244
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:35,121
One tuna and a fluke fin please.

245
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:36,246
An eel for me.

246
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:41,246
So, one order of albacore, and...

247
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:43,538
Heh. I forgot the rest.

248
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:47,038
Wow, he forgot it all.

249
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:02,996
Huh?

250
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:12,038
Hm?

251
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,954
Oh, hello there!

252
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,788
Huh? Uh, yeah, hi?

253
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,079
What do you think you're doing?

254
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:20,871
Uh. Heh, heh...

255
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:34,579
Hey, do you mind? Why do you keep doing that?

256
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:37,538
I can't help it! That thing's so cool and weird!

257
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:39,663
Huh? What? No, it is not!

258
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:42,746
It's normal! Keys are a very popular trend right now.

259
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:44,246
Huh.

260
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,954
How'd you pull that one off, huh?

261
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:54,579
C'mon, what's your secret! I just wanna see it! Chill out!

262
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,371
Okay. Fine. I'll go.

263
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:01,204
--Bye. --What?

264
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,871
Oh, come on, I was just messing with you!

265
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:11,246
Well, I didn't care for it.

266
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,704
So can you please give me my arm back?

267
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:14,538
Huh?

268
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:15,413
Pick a hand!

269
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:16,621
It's in your bag!

270
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:17,913
Hey! You got it!

271
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,413
All right, question number two.

272
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:20,621
Huh?

273
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:22,704
If Kenta's mom goes out to the supermarket

274
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:24,329
and picks up ten apples,

275
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:27,454
and then eats three of them later that day, and gives four

276
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:30,329
of the remaining apples to her neighbor Yumiko then

277
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:31,996
where would you find your missing arm?

278
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:32,996
In your bag!

279
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,163
Oh, wow! You got another one right!

280
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:37,663
All I want is my arm, so can you just...?

281
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,496
Only if you get the answer the final question!

282
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,871
If you want this arm, then you gotta earn it!

283
00:16:42,954 --> 00:16:45,621
But why? It was my arm in the first place!

284
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,746
Do you want it back or not?

285
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:49,621
Yeah, of course I do.

286
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:50,954
Then let's get started.

287
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:54,329
First, try saying the word "bag" ten times fast.

288
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:56,746
Hm?

289
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:01,579
Bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag.

290
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:03,996
What kind of cloth would you use to clean up a mess?

291
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,371
A bag! No, wait, I mean a rag!

292
00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:07,413
Boop! Boop!

293
00:17:07,496 --> 00:17:08,371
Huh?!

294
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:10,246
The correct answer was a towel.

295
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,954
No way! That's so unfair!

296
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,079
I'm just playin'.

297
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:16,871
You're good.

298
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,621
Okay, now can you stop following me around?

299
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:23,121
All right, I'll stop. Don't worry.

300
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:25,371
Heh.

301
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,121
Huh. Would ya look at that.

302
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:35,538
Heh, heh.

303
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:47,663
It came off!

304
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:51,163
Finally! It came off!

305
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:53,496
I'm free!

306
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,538
Huh?

307
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:10,413
Mio!

308
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:11,246
Hm?

309
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:12,496
Hey, I'll walk with you.

310
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:15,079
Okay. Are you on your way back from class too?

311
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:18,371
Yeah, Oh, I just met the most interesting person!

312
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:19,913
Really? Tell me about 'em.

313
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,246
Well, her arm came off.

314
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:22,413
Huh?

315
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:23,663
And she had a key in her back.

316
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:24,996
What?! No way!

317
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,121
I'm not kidding! That's how she was!

318
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:29,204
Sounds pretty weird to me.

319
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,038
I want people to look at me and think,

320
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,204
"Oh, he looks pretty cool!"

321
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:50,204
Hey! You ready, Nano?

322
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:51,954
Okay!

323
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:54,204
Magic ball!

324
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:58,038
Well, she is just a child.

325
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,538
Not surprising.

326
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:01,579
I win!

327
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:03,121
Aw man, I lost!

328
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:04,329
What are they doing?

329
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,246
That is not how you play this game.

330
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:09,204
Sakamoto! How many points did I just get?

331
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,288
What?!

332
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:12,496
'Kay! It's my turn to throw the ball!

333
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:13,913
Go!

334
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,496
She hasn't even pitched yet!

335
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,538
Is she trying to kill me with that?

336
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,079
Sakamoto! How many points did I get for that one, huh?

337
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,038
Oh, come on!

338
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:31,246
She swung again!

339
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:32,954
You're up. Go get 'em, champ.

340
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,329
How do you expect me to do that?

341
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:36,704
There's no way hold that bat in these little paws!

342
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:38,579
Aww...

343
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:40,204
Unbelievable.

344
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:43,079
You'd think you would understand
how paws work at this point.

345
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:45,288
Since you're poking at my pads all the time.

346
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:49,246
You kids can be so simple-mind... ed...

347
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:01,663
Aww...

348
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,121
Uh, okay then. Mew-ving on.

349
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:10,871
The way you kids are playing isn't safe, so, I uh guess

350
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:12,996
I'll just have to sit here and keep an eye on you.

351
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,163
Why don't you just put the bat down and play catch?

352
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:16,788
--Sure! --You got it, coach!

353
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:18,038
Coach?

354
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:20,454
Coach, what do we do if we only have one glove?

355
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:22,246
I think you'll be fine without one.

356
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:24,663
Hey, coach! This glove doesn't fit my little hand.

357
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:26,788
It goes on the other hand like you had it before!

358
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:27,788
Help us, coach!

359
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,163
C'mon, coach!

360
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:32,913
Huh?! What would you kids do without me?

361
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:35,871
Hakase! Here comes the ball!

362
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:37,496
Bring it!

363
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,954
Oh no, where on earth could it have landed?

364
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:51,538
And then the teacher totally freaked out at me!

365
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:54,704
Can't blame him.

366
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,038
Agreed.

367
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,079
You guys really think so?

368
00:20:58,163 --> 00:21:01,079
I think he went a little overboard, personally.

369
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:04,163
Yeah, maybe, but you gotta watch out from now on.

370
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:05,454
Yeah, I guess you're right.

371
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:07,788
It could only get worse from here.

372
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,371
Oh, thank you, sir.

373
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,996
A true gentleman!

374
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,871
So, do mind if I borrow it from ya

375
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:23,538
sometime, Mai, please?

376
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:24,454
Sure.

377
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:25,704
Great! You're the best!

378
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:27,663
I wonder if that's the girl my sister met?

379
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,788
...man I'm starving!

380
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:29,413
I am a Wooden Cube.

381
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:31,621
My master can only obtain the ancient weapon

382
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:34,746
of legend by using my power.

383
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:38,163
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 8.

384
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:40,038
Look forward to it!
