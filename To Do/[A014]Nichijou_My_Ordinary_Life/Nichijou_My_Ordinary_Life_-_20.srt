1
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:09,371
A-A-A-choo!

2
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:17,621
It sure is getting cold lately. Huh?

3
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,830
Wha...?

4
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:23,455
Sakamoto.

5
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:26,121
Sakamoto.

6
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:27,996
Sakamoto.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,163
Sakamoto.

8
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:31,913
Sakamoto.

9
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:34,181
Stop it! Stay back!

10
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:35,621
Cut it out! Wait!

11
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:36,996
Just hold on a second!

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,038
Leave me alone!

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,830
You're freakin' me out!

14
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:43,163
At least--tell me why you're doing this.

15
00:02:14,663 --> 00:02:17,246
Okay, Mai. You can apply the screentones on this one.

16
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,705
Yuuko, take those and use the pen

17
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:20,746
to draw in the appropriate page numbers in the corners.

18
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,788
And fill in the shade of the character's hair, too.

19
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:23,788
Okay!

20
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,413
Amazing!

21
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:28,455
I had no idea you were so proficient in creating manga!

22
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,996
I'm nothing special, so I wouldn't put it that way.

23
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:33,955
She's actually been drawing forever,

24
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:36,080
but kept it a secret until recently.

25
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:37,955
Well, it's not secret anymore, is it?

26
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:39,413
But why did you hide it?

27
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:40,996
Just 'cause.

28
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,371
But now,

29
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:43,830
I guess I don't really think it's that big of a deal

30
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,871
if people find out about what I like to do.

31
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:47,413
Things kinda got put into perspective

32
00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:49,746
after I submitted to a manga magazine.

33
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:51,913
They said that they were looking forward

34
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:53,496
to my next submission,

35
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,538
so I figured there's no point
in keeping it a secret anymore.

36
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,205
That means they think you're talented enough

37
00:02:57,288 --> 00:02:58,705
to get published one day!

38
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,996
Let's not jump to conclusions yet.

39
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,788
Is it okay if I take a look at some of your work?

40
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,955
Uh...

41
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:08,163
Um... Nano?

42
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:10,788
You okay?

43
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,663
Uhh. Hey, don't force it.

44
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:15,455
You don't have to read it if it's not to your taste.

45
00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:16,663
What's the matter?

46
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:19,163
Um, excuse me.

47
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:20,830
I think I need to get some fresh air.

48
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:23,371
I can come with you if you want company.

49
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,496
It's fine.

50
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,788
I don't want to distract you guys

51
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,205
from working on the manuscript,

52
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:28,830
so just keep on keeping on.

53
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:31,163
I'll be back in a little while, okay?

54
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:36,580
Huh. I guess there must be a lot on her mind, huh?

55
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:38,621
Aw, crap!

56
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,080
It's this late already?

57
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:42,455
We really can't afford to waste any more time now!

58
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:44,371
Let's buckle down and focus!

59
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:45,788
No more playing around.

60
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:47,871
We gotta hit that deadline tomorrow.

61
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:49,913
You got it, boss lady!

62
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,455
I dunno if you know this, but I'm quite the artist myself,

63
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,746
so this'll be easy-peasy!

64
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,621
Everybody to battle stations!

65
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,705
Or something.

66
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,205
Come on, Yuuko.

67
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:27,413
You just started and you're slacking off already?

68
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:28,580
Here.

69
00:04:28,663 --> 00:04:30,246
Whoa, that was quick.

70
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,830
All right, I'll check it over.

71
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,746
Now let's see what we got here.

72
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,205
I'll make you a slave.

73
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:36,080
A what?

74
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:39,705
Are you kidding me? Why did you draw this?

75
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,163
It's Kuya the Monk.

76
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:43,080
I don't have time for your stupid pranks!

77
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:45,955
What made you think you had to add things?

78
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,330
The blank page called out, longing to be filled.

79
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,871
What does that mean?!

80
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,705
Take the white out and fix it as fast as possible. Please.

81
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:54,663
Just stick to the screentones like I asked.

82
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,288
And stop vandalizing my art!

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,038
I've experienced a lot of pain in my life,

84
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:02,288
but that had to be the absolute worst. Ever.

85
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:04,996
I better get to work.

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,913
Uh--huh?

87
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:08,788
Huh?

88
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:15,163
Oh, no.

89
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:19,455
Wait! This is bad!

90
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:20,830
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap!

91
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:22,330
Oh, yeah, and--

92
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,371
If you make any mistakes, make sure to tell me right away

93
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:27,455
so I can fix it before it gets any worse.

94
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:29,038
Any worse?

95
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:33,413
Ooh, it can't get any worse than this, right?

96
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:35,080
So, I might as well try to fix it!

97
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:36,205
It's done.

98
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:38,871
Oh? Already?

99
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:42,413
I hope you didn't add anything
weird to the background again.

100
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,205
I'll make you a grave.

101
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:45,205
A what?

102
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:48,496
It's a grave now?!

103
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,996
What even is this?

104
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
A graveyard.

105
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:52,663
That was a rhetorical question!

106
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:55,580
That background's supposed to
be a fancy palace in Daikanyama!

107
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:57,746
So? Why didn't you just draw that?

108
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,330
Why'd it have to be something weird?

109
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,371
Because there was empty space left over.

110
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,080
You're the absolute worst!

111
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,246
Just forget it!

112
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,621
Erase it and I'll do it myself later!

113
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,580
You can only erase, no adding!

114
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,538
Am I making myself clear?

115
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,163
Understood.

116
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:28,288
There.

117
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,955
That doesn't look too bad!

118
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,330
I mean, I'm sure it'd be fine if I drew it on its own,

119
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:35,538
but right now... it doesn't match!

120
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:38,080
Mio is gonna kill me, isn't she?

121
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:39,455
I'm finished.

122
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:41,496
I hope you only erased things like I asked.

123
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,038
Ugh, whatever.

124
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:46,496
My characters better not still
be on that weird background.

125
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,205
Why?! What did you do?

126
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:50,455
I erased.

127
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:52,121
I'm about to erase you here in a second!

128
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:55,371
Why do you keep messing with my artwork like this?

129
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:57,080
Because I don't think the manga you're making

130
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,496
is very interesting.

131
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,830
I'm asking for your help, not your opinion!

132
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:04,246
Forget the erasing and just
take this and draw some panels.

133
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,371
Make sure they match the other page!

134
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:07,705
You got it, boss lady.

135
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:09,955
You better not screw this one up!

136
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,996
Helvetica Standard.

137
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,496
Now ten seconds.

138
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,413
Twenty seconds.

139
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:32,371
And one, two, three, four, five,

140
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:37,746
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

141
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,080
The time is up.

142
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,080
This is not going well!

143
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:55,455
I don't even know

144
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:57,330
what the heck he's supposed to look like anymore!

145
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:58,246
Who is he?

146
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,371
Where did he come from?

147
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:01,330
Mio is definitely gonna kill me now!

148
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:02,330
I'm finished.

149
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,330
Okay...

150
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,830
And you only drew the panels, right?

151
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:11,080
Long, long ago,

152
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:13,746
there lived an ordinary man and woman.

153
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,996
The man ventured out to gather firewood.

154
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,955
The Private second class was born from a peach.

155
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:33,871
That makes no sense!

156
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:38,496
Will you please just follow instructions?

157
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,746
I can do that.

158
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,871
♪ Cha-cha-la-la! Cha! ♪

159
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,996
♪ Cha-cha-la-la! Cha! ♪

160
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,955
♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha Cha-la-la! ♪

161
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:59,246
Thi... is... the worst!

162
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,038
I'm trying my best to fix things,

163
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:03,205
but it gets uglier every time I touch it.

164
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:04,621
This is a pickle.

165
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:05,871
What should I do?

166
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,830
What can I do?

167
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:11,955
Wait, Mai?

168
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:13,205
Just leave it to me.

169
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:16,080
You mean you can fix it?

170
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:18,413
You can draw? Seriously?

171
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,955
Of course she can't.

172
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:26,121
There's no way.

173
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:28,746
That'd be too good to be true.

174
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,830
Wait! Unless...

175
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:32,955
...she's good!

176
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,788
She is, like, crazy good!

177
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:36,538
Maybe she's too crazy!

178
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:38,205
But, right now,

179
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:42,288
if crazy is what it takes, then let's get crazy!

180
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,663
Let's go back to the good ol' days.

181
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:56,205
Back when I didn't know the difference

182
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,080
between right and wrong.

183
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:01,746
When everything was fresh and innocent.

184
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,996
And then, tell the truth and be set free.

185
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:12,080
I'm so sorry!

186
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:14,538
You'll have to draw this section over again!

187
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:17,621
But...

188
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:20,163
We don't have any manuscript paper left!

189
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:38,330
Hey, wait.

190
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:41,246
No running in the hallway.

191
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:44,413
Sasahara!

192
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:01,705
Dammit, it won't come off!

193
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,038
They wanted nothing at all.

194
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:30,496
Gotcha!

195
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:33,413
Hey, Yoshino.

196
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:34,871
What are you doing here?

197
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,038
Looking for me?

198
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,496
I just stopped by, same as you.

199
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,496
Okay...

200
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,746
So, what are you up to?

201
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,246
Um, well, uh, nothing, I guess.

202
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,663
Really?

203
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:50,080
Actually... It's just...

204
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:51,955
I can't concentrate during practice,

205
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:54,205
and we have the competition coming up.

206
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:56,746
I'm not sure if you've ever felt anything like this

207
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,371
when you were in high school,

208
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:00,246
but I feel like it's getting harder and harder

209
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,788
to keep my guard up sometimes.

210
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:04,413
She's not listening.

211
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,496
Have you ever read this manga before?

212
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,371
It's hilarious!

213
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:13,205
For real? She's not helpful with anything but kendo.

214
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:14,413
Not surprised.

215
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:15,830
What? Quit muttering!

216
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:17,496
What were you saying?

217
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,038
Don't worry about it!

218
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:21,663
By the way, you were planning on

219
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:23,538
being at the national kendo championship,

220
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,371
isn't that right?

221
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:26,330
Oh! Yeah, I am.

222
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,580
If that's true,

223
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,996
then how come Mihoshi's been saying

224
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,830
that you haven't been to the dojo in--

225
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:33,163
I forgot I have to go grocery shopping today!

226
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,788
Huh? W-Wait, hang on!

227
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:37,288
You can have my rice crackers.

228
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,121
Thanks?

229
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:40,788
See ya!

230
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:47,913
What was that all about?

231
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:49,955
Hey, Sis!

232
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:53,621
What are ya doin'?

233
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,038
Just chillin' here?

234
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:57,371
I was, uh, just talking to Yoshino.

235
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:59,996
Even though the national championship's tomorrow?

236
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,871
Hold on. Tomorrow?

237
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,371
Did she mention anything?

238
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:05,830
Mm... Not really.

239
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:08,663
Wait! She left me these things.

240
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,246
Want one?

241
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,163
Sure.

242
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:13,913
Wow, its red.

243
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:16,371
It sure is.

244
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,871
Spicy!

245
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:24,705
I don't think so!

246
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,621
What do you mean?

247
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,830
I'm not sure!

248
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:50,996
Hey, Mio. Turn around. I want you to see this!

249
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,830
Huh?

250
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:53,080
You like my new look?

251
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:54,496
I've been wanting to change things up,

252
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,996
so I bought some of these thingies the other day.

253
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,496
You like 'em?

254
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,705
Yeah, they suit you.

Huh?

266
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,580
Beginner's luck is a hell of a thing. Whatever.

267
00:14:42,663 --> 00:14:43,830
If you say so.

268
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:46,038
I usually don't reduce myself

269
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:47,913
to playing with kids like you,

270
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:51,621
but sometimes the boredom can be a little too much.

271
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:52,913
Right.

272
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:55,788
What are you waiting for?

273
00:14:55,871 --> 00:14:56,621
Don't just sit there!

274
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:57,913
Let's go play some more!

275
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:00,288
--All right! --Shabadaba-doo!

276
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,621
Hakase?

277
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,288
Where are you?

278
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:19,746
Hey, kid! You there?

279
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,830
Come on out!

280
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:23,871
Who knew she'd be so good at hiding.

281
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:26,163
She really did disappear, huh?

282
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:31,330
They're never, ever gonna find me in here.

283
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:32,871
Knowing her, I'd wager that she's

284
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:34,621
probably hiding somewhere outside.

285
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:35,955
That makes sense.

286
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,538
But maybe we should take a break.

287
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:38,746
Sounds good.

288
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,913
It's just as well.

289
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:41,246
I dunno about you,

290
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,371
but I'd be fine with never finding her!

291
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:49,121
Whoa, there you are.

292
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:54,746
Did you build this room all by yourself?

293
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,288
Mm-hmm.

294
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:58,205
Why'd you come out of such a good hiding spot?

295
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:00,621
There's no point in us seeking if you don't hide.

296
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,288
Get it?

297
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,746
I was scared that you wouldn't be able to

298
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,496
find me in my secret room and I'd be hiding forever.

299
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,621
Well, that's a good point.

300
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,663
Hakase.

301
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:19,538
Did you... blow your nose on me?

302
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:20,663
Yeah.

303
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,996
Now I'm gonna have to

304
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,330
put my school uniform in the laundry, too.

305
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,330
Then I guess that settles it.

306
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,038
Looks like I'll be it this time!

307
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:31,413
Sound good? Ready, set, go!

308
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:34,371
I can help you wash your school uniform if you want.

309
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:36,163
That'll probably just make things worse,

310
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,413
so I think I'll pass.

311
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,288
You won't know for sure till you try!

312
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:41,830
No, I think I'm pretty sure about this one.

313
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,955
Aw, come on! It'll be fine!

314
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:50,663
The Life of Pyon!

315
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:51,580
Check him out!

316
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,746
That's it. No more excuses!

317
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,788
I can't believe you!

318
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:41,913
Well, yeah, uh, I was saying--

319
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,913
I don't care what you have to say!

320
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:48,663
You coming over to help out

321
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:51,121
was a nice gesture and everything.

322
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,413
I get that.

323
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,705
But all you did was make things worse for me.

324
00:17:55,996 --> 00:17:57,830
And then, after I said that we were out of paper,

325
00:17:57,913 --> 00:17:59,246
instead of going out and getting more,

326
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,621
you had to make it difficult.

327
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,663
Do you remember that?

328
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:05,705
I asked you to go buy some, and what did you say?

329
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:08,496
Hey, how's about we flip for it?

330
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,413
Take it off our hands... and leave it to fate!

331
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:17,955
Not a chance in hell!

332
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:20,580
You're the one who spilled all
the ink and ruined the page.

333
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:22,371
How could you even consider making me go

334
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:24,746
when I have so much work to do? Come on!

335
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,955
But I got over it!

336
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,288
You ended up agreeing with me

337
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:29,038
and you said you'd be the one to go to the store.

338
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:30,705
And then what did you have to say?

339
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:32,371
Mio, I, uh...

340
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:33,996
What did you say?

341
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,288
Question.

342
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:37,455
Judging by my face, how old do I look?

343
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:39,080
Who cares?!

344
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:40,330
You just keep wasting my time

345
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:41,955
and the paper store's gonna close!

346
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,788
Why bring that up now of all times?

347
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,288
Why would you ask me that?

348
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:46,538
But I got over it!

349
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:48,746
You finally decided to head off to the store,

350
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,163
and what did you suddenly have to complain about?

351
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:53,288
It sure is chilly out.

352
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:56,080
Oh, speaking of, I think I might've caught a cold.

353
00:18:56,163 --> 00:18:58,330
How could you have caught a cold out of nowhere?!

354
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,205
You just kept on wasting my time!

355
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:02,246
And--it's not even that cold out!

356
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,496
But I got over it!

357
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,288
And? What did you come back with in hand?

358
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,080
The hell is that anyway?!

359
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:10,038
All you had to do was get the manuscript paper

360
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:11,163
like I asked!

361
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:12,871
But you had to make your stupid jokes!

362
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:14,996
And you just could never tell when enough was enough!

363
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,830
Here.

364
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:17,371
That's a hard pass for me!

365
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:19,246
I thought I was at the end of my rope with you,

366
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,413
but you keep finding more rope to cut!

367
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:22,538
Especially when you don't stop

368
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,663
coming up with dumb things to say!

369
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,955
I'm so sorry, calamari.

370
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,788
Calamari?!

371
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:31,163
This isn't even funny anymore!

372
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:33,830
Where the hell did calamari come from anyway?

373
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,413
And after all that,

374
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:37,663
I still actually believed that
you got the manuscript paper.

375
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:40,455
But it was some esoteric joke that gave me a headache!

376
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:42,871
All I wanted was for you to hurry up and get the paper,

377
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:44,413
but what did you say to that?

378
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:47,121
Sorry for the delay. Please frog-ive me.

379
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:48,830
It's a frog now?!

380
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:50,871
Are you actually asking for forgiveness?

381
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,121
Or are you asking me to give you a frog?

382
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,621
I ask you one final time

383
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:57,163
if you actually got any of the manuscript paper,

384
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:59,038
and what did you have to say to that?

385
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,496
Sorry safari.

386
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:04,455
Where'd safari come from and what happened to calamari?!

387
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,788
Wait, who cares about calamari?

388
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,663
Where is my paper?

389
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:10,705
Oh, yeah! You gave me something else!

390
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:13,038
--Here. --Writing paper. Indeed.

391
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:16,121
Now I have all the tools I need... for my novel.

392
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:17,580
Wrong kind of paper!

393
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,746
How long do you intend to make a joke out of my life

394
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,746
until you're satisfied?

395
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,371
What do you want from me, huh?

396
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,746
Oh wait, you said--!

397
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,788
You know, there's a funny thing about the truth.

398
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:27,163
It's not always true.

399
00:20:27,246 --> 00:20:28,288
Yes, it is!

400
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:29,705
I decided you were a lost cause

401
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:32,038
and I had no choice but to turn to Nano.

402
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:34,455
But I messed up and showed her my work in progress.

403
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:35,455
And then she--!

404
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:38,080
She got hooked!

405
00:20:38,163 --> 00:20:39,413
Thanks, but no thanks!

406
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:41,621
She just can't stop squealing!

407
00:20:41,705 --> 00:20:44,080
I got so desperate, I even asked Mai for help!

408
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:47,996
Mai, could you do me a favor and get me some more paper?

409
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,455
But she bounced already!

410
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:51,955
She vanished like the wind!

411
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:55,205
Flowing swiftly yet silently at her own pace!

412
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,580
Sure, it was kind of disrespectful,

413
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,080
but that's not the point!

414
00:20:58,163 --> 00:21:00,496
The point is, you saw the goodbye letter she left behind,

415
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,913
and you said what?

416
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:04,538
This could be a sign from God,

417
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:05,996
or the trap of a demon.

418
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,496
You're the demon who's trapping me!

419
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,121
This entire day has been a trap

420
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:12,538
since you showed up to quote-unquote "help"!

421
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:15,788
And it just kept on going and going!

422
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:17,538
I don't even get that one!

423
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,788
--Uh, you know-- --Shut up!

424
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:20,913
I don't wanna hear any more excuses from you!

425
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,788
You're just a pumpkin head!

426
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:24,038
Hang on, now.

427
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:25,330
Don't go nuts.

428
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:27,455
I'm only going nuts because you're making me!

429
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:31,205
You dumb...

430
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:33,205
...giant peanut head!

431
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:34,413
I'm trying to tell you--

432
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:35,996
Don't try to give me another one of your--

433
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,913
Your--

434
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,580
Huh?

435
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:47,788
Uh...

436
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:50,455
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:53,205
Please... frog-ive me?

438
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:28,121
Hello!

439
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:30,746
I'm the medium of your dreams, Manga Manuscript Paper.

440
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,746
Draw your heart out and achieve fame,

441
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,163
shooting me through the mail service of your choice.

442
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:38,413
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 21.

443
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,246
Walk-ins are welcome, too.
