1
00:00:07,177 --> 00:00:08,584
Lunch time, so I'm out of the woods!

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,275
I can't believe you got away with
not doing your homework again.

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,650
It's about time that I had some good luck, Mio.

4
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:14,775
I was getting tired of having to

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:16,359
stand out in the hallway every day.

6
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:17,817
Maybe things are looking up for me.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,192
Just do your homework.

8
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,234
Y'know what'd be great?

9
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:22,942
You getting me a juice to celebrate my luck!

10
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:23,900
Huh?

11
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:51,942
Young lady. We need to have a little chat

12
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:53,275
about your missing assignments,

13
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,692
so please come to the faculty room immediately.

14
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:57,817
Okay.

15
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,109
Maybe I should get her a juice.

16
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:33,692
Hey! I'm over here!

17
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:35,400
Oh, hey! I'm sorry.

18
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:36,567
Were you waiting long?

19
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,609
Not at all!

20
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:38,775
I actually just got here myself.

21
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:44,609
Sis sure is being extra loud with her friends tonight.

22
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,484
'Kay, so, I gotta know.

23
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,692
How are "things"?

24
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,442
--Hm? --How's what now?

25
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:52,817
Don't you be shy!

26
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,150
Come on!

27
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:57,275
I'm talkin' about you and Koujirou's love life.

28
00:02:58,609 --> 00:02:59,775
Why would I even think about

29
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:01,567
marrying and spending my life with that weirdo?

30
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,734
What? I never mentioned that!

31
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,192
And children?

32
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:07,400
You can forget it!

33
00:03:07,484 --> 00:03:09,317
I hear ya loud and clear!

34
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,817
You, Koujirou, and his goat

35
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,859
already have a long and happy life planned out together!

36
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,067
No, we don't.

37
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,067
So, what's been going on with you, Weboshii?

38
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,609
Huh? Who, me?

39
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:20,067
Nothing you need to know about.

40
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,150
Aww, hey, you can tell me!

41
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:24,192
Is there somebody you have your eye on?

42
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,067
Uh-huh.

43
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,150
Just spit it out!

44
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,567
I wanna know!

45
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,317
Stop it, stop it!

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,567
Okay! I'll tell you...

47
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,650
I'm not stopping till you say who it is!

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,442
All right! As soon as you let me go!

49
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:43,359
You better speak up right now, or else!

50
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:44,192
Ow!

51
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,734
I already said I'd tell you!

52
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:49,025
Sorry. I was having so much
fun, I guess I got carried away.

53
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,025
So? Give us the juicy details!

54
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,817
I wanna know more about this guy you like!

55
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,109
Hmm. I wouldn't say that I like him, not yet anyway.

56
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:58,775
Sure, I'm interested, but I don't even know his name.

57
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,609
He's that one cool guy with the mohawk.

58
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,900
--Ahh. --It's that guy.

59
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:06,025
Oh, so you know who I'm talking about, then?

60
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,650
Everybody knows about him.

61
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,984
He's pretty popular with that crazy hairdo of his.

62
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,525
Of course we'd know him.

63
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,692
But why are you interested in him of all people, Weboshii?

64
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:15,609
Hmm.

65
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:17,859
I guess he kinda...

66
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,359
...gives off a bad-boy vibe.

67
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,109
I dunno, there's something about the dangerous type.

68
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,234
He totally seems like one of those, right?

69
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:27,609
Yeah, definitely.

70
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,817
And his mohawk is like a bad-boy beacon!

71
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,109
Get this. I saw him the other day,

72
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:35,484
and he was being a good, upstanding member of society.

73
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,234
Yeah, okay!

74
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:42,900
The only thing that's upstanding is his hair!

75
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:44,984
I'm serious. I know what I saw.

76
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,275
He was watering the school's flowers.

77
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,775
What? Get outta here!

78
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:50,067
Oh, yeah, and then, he, like,

79
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,525
even fed the plants with this fertilizer stuff.

80
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:53,525
Oh, wow!

81
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:55,025
I never thought he'd be so sweet!

82
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:56,775
You can't judge a book by its cover, huh?

83
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,275
Yeah, you got that right.

84
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,067
I guess he isn't a punk after all.

85
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,859
And I think I might actually
like him more now that I know.

86
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:03,942
Yeah I get what you mean.

87
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,900
I prefer it when guys are nice, too.

88
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:07,067
So does that mean there's

89
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,817
someone you've got the hots for right now?

90
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,859
What, me? Well, I, uh...

91
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:12,025
Sasahara's that way.

92
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:14,525
Here you are.

93
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:18,817
I saw him feeding his goat this one time in the
pouring rain and I thought that was pretty nice.

94
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:22,275
Yeah, I get it!

95
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,109
That does sound pretty nice. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm!

96
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,400
I see why you like him.

97
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:27,609
What? I never said I liked him or anything

98
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,025
just because he's nice.

99
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,525
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm! So anyway!

100
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:31,900
Tell us who you're after!

101
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:33,359
Huh? What do you mean?

102
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,859
If you like someone, then tell us who it is.

103
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:38,109
Um, I can't think of anyone in particular

104
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:39,692
that I'm interested in.

105
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,650
I guess I'm just not into weirdos like you guys are.

106
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:48,192
Helvetica Standard.

107
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,275
--Begin! --Seiya!

108
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:54,317
Here I come!

109
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:58,692
Soiya!

110
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,150
One point!

111
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:10,650
Ow! Man, that hurts.

112
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,234
Hang on a sec. Here.

113
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:16,442
Thanks, I really appreciate it--

114
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,067
What's wrong? Lemme see your hand.

115
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,359
Huh?

116
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,859
It's finally my day off,

117
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:40,359
but since I have so many errands to run,

118
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:44,442
this will end up being just as busy as a regular work day.

119
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,442
Oh, well. At least it's peaceful.

120
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:48,275
I guess that's enough.

121
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:52,275
It looks like this'll be another
boring day for me, then, huh?

122
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:54,525
Hello there.

123
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:55,609
Hm?

124
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:02,359
Casual clothes?

125
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:05,234
This is what she looks like outside of work?

126
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:07,650
Are you out shopping as well, Mr. Takasaki?

127
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,234
And those pigtails!

128
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:11,775
Bumping into Sakurai like this on a weekend?

129
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:14,650
It's almost as if we're more than just colleagues.

130
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,275
I'm so happy.

131
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,359
This is the best day ever.

132
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:20,859
Oh, no, are you okay?

133
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,484
You're not feeling ill, are you?

134
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,317
Don't worry about me!

135
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,025
I'm surprised to see you here, that's all!

136
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:28,650
Oh! Could you be out shopping today, too, Ms. Sakurai?

137
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:30,859
Yes! There's a great sale on green onions today,

138
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:32,775
so I figured I'd go out and pick some up.

139
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,234
Green onions, huh?

140
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:36,609
Well, if you ever find yourself needing bamboo sprouts,

141
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:38,525
just give me a shout and I'll get you some!

142
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:40,942
Uh, you have extra bamboo sprouts?

143
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,109
Well, I kind of have...

144
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:44,067
You know, come to think of it...

145
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,484
Really, you do?

146
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,484
That sounds wonderful!

147
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,525
Bumping into her like this on the weekend...

148
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:52,942
It feels like it was meant to be.

149
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:57,150
Almost as if fate brought us together.

150
00:07:57,234 --> 00:08:00,484
This wasn't some chance encounter. It was destiny.

151
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,317
I never believed in this kind of stuff before,

152
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,442
but I think I get it now.

153
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,400
I wish I were a green onion!

154
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:10,692
You sure you're okay?

155
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,859
It kind of looks like you're in pain, so...

156
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:13,942
...maybe we should sit down.

157
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,317
Don't worry about me!

158
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I'm doing completely fine, 100 percent fine!

159
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:19,692
I wouldn't want you to trouble
yourself with something like--

160
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:20,942
...maybe we should sit down.

161
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,817
With something like...

162
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,442
...maybe we should sit down.

163
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:26,734
...maybe we should sit down.

164
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,317
...maybe we should sit down.

165
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:34,400
This is the best.

166
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:35,900
I hope it never ends.

167
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:38,359
I know! I have a great idea, Ms. Sakurai!

168
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,567
There's a park a few blocks down,

169
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,275
so why don't we go down there and sit down?

170
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,817
Uh, okay!

171
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,484
Oh, man.

172
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,692
I can't believe this is actually happening right now.

173
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,609
Hang on!

174
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:54,275
Could this be... considered a date?!

175
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:59,275
Why is she here?

176
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:01,317
Actually, you know what? I'm fine!

177
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,109
So maybe we should just turn around.

178
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,734
A student, here? Now?

179
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,525
I can't have her seeing us together.

180
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:09,734
Uh... Hey! What are you two doing over there?

181
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,234
D-Don't be silly!

182
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,942
This is just a completely casual meeting between adults.

183
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:13,817
And, uh, that's it!

184
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,109
Fancy seeing you here!

185
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:16,525
If I didn't know any better,

186
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:19,109
I'd say you two were on a secret date or something.

187
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,734
If you think it's a secret, why would you say it out loud?

188
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:23,109
Aw, what's the big deal?

189
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:25,067
You guys look like you're having fun!

190
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,067
You turd.

191
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,650
Uh--hm?

192
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:33,609
I hope you're having a fine morning today, Ms. Sakurai.

193
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:34,692
Huh?

194
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,525
Look, it's the two love birds!

195
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:39,525
Look at 'em blush!

196
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:41,150
Ooh!

197
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:42,067
That's enough!

198
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,317
No teasing the teachers!

199
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:49,150
Those darn kids always take things too far.

200
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:50,942
I'm sorry about all this.

201
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,525
I hope it didn't cause you too much trouble.

202
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:54,484
It didn't.

203
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,525
But, um...

204
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:59,400
I, um, thought it was kinda cute.

205
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:02,442
That's it! Okay! Let's do this!

206
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,692
What's wrong with me?

207
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:05,650
It would never work out so perfectly like that!

208
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:06,775
I gotta get outta here!

209
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:07,900
What's going on?

210
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:08,682
Nothing!

211
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:11,192
Why does it look like you're
hiding something, Mr. Takasaki?

212
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,775
Well, it's been a lovely coincidence

213
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:22,025
seeing you here, Ms. Sakurai!

214
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:23,859
And wouldn't ya know it, there's a student here, too!

215
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:25,234
What are the chances of seeing two people

216
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,859
from the school in the exact same place!

217
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,150
Hm? What was your name?

218
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:29,650
It's Aioi, isn't that right?

219
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:31,567
Just kidding! Of course I'd remember!

220
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,484
Uh--

221
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:33,650
Well! In any case!

222
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,317
I've got places to go and people to see,

223
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,400
so if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna hit the 'ol dusty trail!

224
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:53,817
Maybe... I should pick up some green onions.

225
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:59,775
Sorry for calling you out like this.

226
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,484
You sleep okay last night?

227
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:05,609
I did, but... I had the most peculiar dream.

228
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:07,734
Oh, really? What happened?

229
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:12,109
Well, um... we were standing here kissing.

230
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:14,359
What if I made that dream a reality?

231
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:17,275
Hey! Uh, Hakase!

232
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:19,109
Let's go get you some more snacks!

233
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,859
Do you really have those kinds of feelings for me?

234
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,900
Save your questions for after.

235
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,859
Oh, my! Sir!

236
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:41,359
After one whole month of investigating,

237
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:43,109
I've determined that Nano Shinonome

238
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:46,234
visits the supermarket in this district every Saturday.

239
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:49,192
If my calculations are correct, she'll be arriving soon.

240
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,859
And once she does, I'll be right behind her.

241
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,234
When I find my opening,

242
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,942
I'll call upon my trusty friend, Mr. Short Circuit,

243
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,192
once again to assist me in this abduction.

244
00:11:58,275 --> 00:11:59,442
For science!

245
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:00,942
It's the perfect plan!

246
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:04,525
Today shall be the day I study you, Miss Shinonome!

247
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:08,442
Or not!

248
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:09,942
Why isn't she showing up?

249
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:11,025
Could it be that she doesn't

250
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:12,734
come to the supermarket every week?

251
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,317
Maybe my calculations were off.

252
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
No. I can't give up now.

253
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:19,567
I've already waited this long,

254
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,400
so I can't let it be for nothing!

255
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:22,609
Hmm.

256
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,942
I knew it! So it is you, Ms. Nakamura.

257
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,484
Fancy seeing you here.

258
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,067
Likewise, you walking pair of sideburns!

259
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,317
Uh, hello there.

260
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,817
I hardly recognized you

261
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
without your usual lab coat on.

262
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:35,067
I don't have time for this

263
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,150
pointless small talk right now.

264
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:38,359
If I don't focus,

265
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,150
Nano Shinonome might slip through my fingers

266
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:42,525
without me even noticing her.

267
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,442
I never woulda guessed that your street clothes

268
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:45,567
would be so boy-ish.

269
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,817
I'm surprised.

270
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,609
It looks pretty cute on you.

271
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:53,025
Um, well, no, actually, this is just my, uh...

272
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:56,025
I'm so used to you being all
serious with that lab coat on,

273
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,067
so seeing you like this makes you seem cuter, I guess.

274
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,525
I'll have to retreat for today!

275
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,775
Hang on, you forgot your science thingy!

276
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:10,859
So then,

277
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:12,525
have you given any thought to what you might

278
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:15,359
want to do in the future at all, Miss Minakami?

279
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:16,859
I have thought about it.

280
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:23,067
Uh... So, are you planning on finding a job?

281
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,900
Then... are you... looking into higher education?

282
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:33,650
Uh... 'Kay that means...

283
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:38,442
I think I get it.

284
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:54,609
Hey, you find it yet?

285
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,817
It's no good.

286
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,400
We can't find the cube.

287
00:13:58,484 --> 00:13:59,650
I thought we stored that thing

288
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:00,567
somewhere safe.

289
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,734
How could it just disappear?

290
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,150
Well, look on the bright side.

291
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:05,734
There's gonna be a huge cash reward

292
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:07,442
for whoever finds the dang thing.

293
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:08,859
I'd say that's worth all the trouble

294
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:09,984
we're going through.

295
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:11,317
Ha, yeah!

296
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,317
If we can find one, then we can find the other.

297
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,775
Better keep looking.

298
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:17,150
If I could just get my hands on that cube.

299
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:19,359
I wonder if that would help me
get in the King's good graces.

300
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,359
Hey, uh, who's that?

301
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,234
Over there?

302
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:23,650
Huh?

303
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,859
My wooden cube.

304
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:31,692
Give it back.

305
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:37,734
Hey, now.

306
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:40,275
What seems to be the big problem here, little girl?

307
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,150
How did you manage to get on this ship?

308
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:43,025
Don't tell me.

309
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:45,317
You're some kind of stowaway?

310
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,942
Do you know how we punish kids for doing that?

311
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:49,859
We throw them straight into prison.

312
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,192
Ten years minimum.

313
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,692
And the worst part is, I'd be your warden!

314
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:54,692
That what you want?

315
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:57,275
No, 22!

316
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:58,900
Damn it! You're gonna pay!

317
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:00,900
Hold it. I can handle this.

318
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,484
I got careless for a split second there.

319
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,150
But I've got this under control now, trust me.

320
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:07,525
I gotta say.

321
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:10,025
You sure do pack quite a powerful punch

322
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,734
for such a tiny girl.

323
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:12,734
Now then.

324
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,234
This has been fun,

325
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:16,817
but it's time you started talk--

326
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:19,442
Is he okay?

327
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:20,650
Negative. He's dead.

328
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:21,519
She's a monster!

329
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:24,275
The stowaway isn't gonna stop
until she gets the wooden cube!

330
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,692
Let's charge at her together!

331
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:27,400
We've got her outnumbered.

332
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:28,734
Hmm.

333
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,067
There's no reason to panic,

334
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,484
now that I'm here, so everybody can settle down.

335
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:33,984
Officer!

336
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:40,984
Relax. Just sit back and watch how it's done.

337
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,484
In this situation,

338
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,275
the Officer might actually be our only hope.

339
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,442
Hmm. So, she's on a solo mission

340
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,025
to claim the wooden cube.

341
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:53,109
Undoubtedly a highly-skilled
agent sent by an unknown enemy.

342
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:55,984
All that skill and power could be quite useful, though,

343
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:59,192
if we can convince her to switch over to our side.

344
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:02,484
Fortunately, I am in possession of the other wooden cube.

345
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:03,775
It's what she wants,

346
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:05,775
so it makes the perfect bargaining chip,

347
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:08,609
and we should be able to come to an agreement.

348
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:11,192
I just happen to have the cube you're looking for,

349
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,317
so what do you say we make a trade?

350
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,275
We could strike a promising deal--

351
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,984
Ooh!

352
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:26,942
Officer!

353
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:28,192
He's dead, too!

354
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,734
This is not good!

355
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:31,900
She took down the Officer like it was nothing!

356
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:33,067
We'll show you!

357
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,609
We're not gonna let you out of here alive!

358
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:38,317
This is bad! Really, really bad!

359
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,859
By definition, that means it's not good.

360
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:44,984
What does that mean, Scholar?

361
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,609
How bad is "really, really bad"?

362
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:49,025
If you would all stop yelling at me for a moment

363
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,442
and observe the intruder's head,

364
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,734
you'll notice that she has a wooden cube in her hair.

365
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:54,400
And if you look on the other side of her head,

366
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:56,609
there's another wooden cube.

367
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:58,942
Meaning that she has a total of two wooden cubes!

368
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:01,567
Which means that she has both
wooden cubes in her possession!

369
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,067
But even if she has

370
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,275
both the cubes,

371
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,400
we should be fine as long as she doesn't know

372
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,859
how to summon the ancient weapon.

373
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,317
That's right! We can still win if--

374
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,109
Shut up and listen to me!

375
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:11,775
It says here in the Hell Encyclopedia,

376
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,734
that whoever possesses both of the wooden cubes

377
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,525
will be bestowed with the unstoppable power

378
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,525
of the ancient weapon!

379
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,942
In other words,

380
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,442
it means that whoever possesses both of the wooden cubes

381
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,275
will be bestowed with the unstoppable power

382
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,567
of the ancient weapon.

383
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,442
What does that mean?

384
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:26,817
Explain that once more, please!

385
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,609
Yeah, I didn't get it the first time!

386
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:29,650
In other--

387
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,859
There's no time to explain!

388
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:34,234
It is over!

389
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:36,067
If we try to fight here, not only will we be doomed,

390
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,234
but the entire world along with us!

391
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,234
Don't you dare back down!

392
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,859
Never run from you fears!

393
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,359
Conquer them!

394
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,484
It's the Captain!

395
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,025
Captain!

396
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,150
All right!

397
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:58,734
Listen. Trying to attack her

398
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:01,984
head-on one at a time will only guarantee your demise.

399
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,567
It would be futile.

400
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,150
However! The enemy is but one lone girl!

401
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:08,442
So we have the advantage of numbers on our side!

402
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:10,317
We must work together as a complete unit

403
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,109
to rush in and take those wooden cubes from her

404
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,484
no matter the cost!

405
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,525
I'll take point and lead the vanguard!

406
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,817
Attack!

407
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,234
Captain!

408
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:24,234
Forget about me! Carry on!

409
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:25,525
But, we can't just--

410
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:26,859
You piddling maggot!

411
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,317
I don't remember training a pathetic,

412
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,234
cowardly soldier like you!

413
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,567
It's all over.

414
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,150
The Officer is gone.

415
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,442
The Captain is stuck in a hole.

416
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,192
What hope do we have left now?

417
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,234
We're a team.

418
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:49,317
And we still have each other.

419
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:54,984
One for all... and all for one!

420
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,442
Captain, no!

421
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:21,984
It's been 12 long years since I joined this squad.

422
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:27,525
Over a decade of my life gone in a flash,

423
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,692
because of this girl.

424
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,150
It can't be over.

425
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:37,817
I'm not done yet.

426
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:44,359
It won't end like this!

427
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,317
We're doomed!

428
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,234
Please, no!

429
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:07,025
I don't wanna die here!

430
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:32,609
Huh?

431
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,400
I'll go stand in the hallway.

432
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,150
Huh?

433
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:46,942
That's so obvious!

434
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:48,192
Whatever.

435
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,859
I've got nothing else to do right now,

436
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:52,025
so I might as well indulge the little brat.

437
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:57,150
Making something a waste of time

438
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:59,650
is a special talent indeed.

439
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:08,525
Hmm.

440
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,359
Oh, you have bed-head.

441
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,817
It's actually pretty cute on you.

442
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,859
It looks pretty cute on you.

443
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:30,650
What the hell am I doing?

444
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:32,650
What's wrong with me?

445
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,525
I'm finished now!

446
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,900
The bath is all yours whenever you--

447
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:28,109
I'm a Love Umbrella.

448
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:30,359
If you need a matchmaker, I've got you covered!

449
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,609
Write your name on one side,

450
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,567
and your special someone on the other.

451
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,942
Oh? You don't have one?

452
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:36,525
Then for a sad sap like you,

453
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:39,150
the next <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 22.

454
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,775
Look forward to it!
