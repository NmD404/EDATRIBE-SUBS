1
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,941
It's more beautiful than I ever could've imagined!

2
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:24,603
Hey, what's goin' on in here?

3
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:26,519
Just the best thing ever!

4
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:29,144
Hey, be careful over there, Sakamoto!

5
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:31,978
I wouldn't want you getting your hair

6
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,686
on my nice new uniform.

7
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:35,769
You've been shedding a lot lately.

8
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:41,353
I see how it is. I'm just in the way now.

9
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:44,728
I'm changing, so wait out here for a few seconds.

10
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:35,353
Check me out! Isn't this the most perfect fit ever?

11
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:36,478
Uh, well, yeah!

12
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:38,103
It was made based on your measurements,

13
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:39,478
so of course it fits!

14
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:40,936
How do I look?

15
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,103
You look pretty good, I guess.

16
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:46,436
Ugh. You don't get it! That's not what I meant at all!

17
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,186
Uh. Does it make me, um... look normal?

18
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:53,436
Sure.

19
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,561
I suppose you look like any other school girl.

20
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:57,436
Do you really mean it?

21
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,603
You're the bestest kitty in the whole world, Sakamoto!

22
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:01,728
Oh, wait! Fur!

23
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:03,394
What is up with you today?

24
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:05,519
I'll tell you what's up. School!

25
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,269
And maybe even some new friends on the horizon!

26
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:09,769
I don't get it, but okay.

27
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:11,186
Oh, hey, Nano.

28
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:12,394
Wanna do what friends do

29
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:14,228
and grab some ice cream after school?

30
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:17,103
Uh. Yeah. That sounds wonderful.

31
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:19,436
Great! How about we go sing karaoke, too?

32
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,186
Huh? Really?

33
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,061
Well, um. Maybe.

34
00:03:23,144 --> 00:03:24,686
I've never done that before!

35
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,894
Don't worry! I'll show you how! Come on, everyone's going!

36
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:31,519
Oh. In that case, okay.

37
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:33,561
Wouldn't that be amazing?

38
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:35,311
Hi, Nano. Morning.

39
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:37,478
Oh, Hakase! Good morning!

40
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:39,561
Look at how well the uniform fits me!

41
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:42,728
So, what do you think? Do I look all right?

42
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:45,686
Um, yeah! You look cool!

43
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,019
Thanks, Hakase!

44
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:53,061
And I think you look cool in your pajamas!

45
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:54,644
You mean it? I'm cool?

46
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:56,936
You are super-duper cool!

47
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,644
But she wears that same thing all the time.

48
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:02,353
Sakamoto! Don't worry, you're cool, too!

49
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,769
Handkerchief, check! Student ID, check!

50
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,936
Textbooks, check! Notebook, check!

51
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,186
Pencils, check! Extra lead, check!

52
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,436
And mechanical pencil, check!

53
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:15,519
Okay! Everything is here!

54
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:17,811
What is it?

55
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:19,644
You're forgetting something.

56
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,394
Huh? Am I really?

57
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:24,478
What'll you do if you're hungry?

58
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:27,686
Grab a Snickers!

59
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,478
Good thinkin'!

60
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,478
I left some food in the kitchen for you.

61
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:34,228
There should be enough for breakfast and lunch.

62
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,103
And I'll take care of the laundry later today,

63
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:38,936
so make sure to gather the clothes you want washed

64
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,853
before I get home from school.

65
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:44,478
Okay, but what time will you be getting out of school?

66
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,769
Well, it ends around 3:30, I think.

67
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,603
But I'll need to do some shopping for dinner

68
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:49,811
on the way back,

69
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:52,769
so I should be home by 5:00, at the latest.

70
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:53,936
At 5:00?

71
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,103
What's up? Did I forget to tell you that?

72
00:04:57,186 --> 00:04:59,186
Five o'clock is like nighttime.

73
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,853
I guess. But that's just how it's gotta be.

74
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,019
'Kay, I'll be on my wa--

75
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,978
Hey, uh, what's the problem?

76
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:07,894
I changed my mind!

77
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:09,353
What?

78
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:11,144
But you were completely on board with it a second ago.

79
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,686
I don't want you to go! You can't go!

80
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,686
No way! I'm gonna be late for school!

81
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:17,936
So could you please just give me back my--

82
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,936
Ah! My left hand!

83
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,644
Rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, roll.

84
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:26,436
Listen, kid! Now really isn't the time for this.

85
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,894
Hakase.

86
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:29,603
How about I make it up to you by cooking

87
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:31,353
your favorite rice omelet for dinner?

88
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:33,269
No strings attached!

89
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:35,228
Okay then.

90
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:36,853
I'll pick up some shark castellas

91
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,936
while I'm out shopping.

92
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,228
And I'll, uh... I'll throw in
an extra strawberry juice, too!

93
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:46,686
Rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, roll.

94
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,353
Also.

95
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:49,353
What is it?

96
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,269
Win the Akutagawa prize.

97
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:54,103
But that's impossible!

98
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,769
I was starting to get worried there for a second,

99
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:01,644
but thankfully, I was able to convince her.

100
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,561
Today marks the first step towards me

101
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:05,728
becoming a normal person!

102
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,936
Oh, no! It totally slipped my mind!

103
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,769
What am I gonna do about this key on my back?

104
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:23,769
Things we think are freakin' cool!

105
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,311
Let's do this! It's time to get to work!

106
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,311
Awesome! A motivated upperclassman!

107
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:38,894
What should I do?

108
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,311
I've been thinking all morning,

109
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:42,353
but I can't come up with anything.

110
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,853
And there's no way I can back out now.

111
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:46,728
Now then, I'd like to introduce

112
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:48,228
our new transfer student.

113
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,561
Miss Shinonome?

114
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:50,769
Yes!

115
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:06,436
I knew it! Everyone's freaked out by my key!

116
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,728
Here.

117
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,561
Miss Shinonome, take this and write your name

118
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:11,269
on the chalkboard, please.

119
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:16,269
Oh, no. Now they're all staring at my back!

120
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,144
I've gotta come up with an excuse quick!

121
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:21,853
Uh, hi. My name's Nano Shinonome!

122
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:24,436
And, um, you see.

123
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,894
I, uh, I was on my way to school, and then I fell?

124
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:31,103
And a key got stuck to me!

125
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:35,394
That made it worse! How do I fix this?

126
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,853
Uh, that story I told you, just, uh, forget about it!

127
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:43,061
I was kidding!

128
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:45,769
Oh, no! Now it's even more suspicious!

129
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:49,686
Uh, let's see. I've gotta say something. Anything!

130
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,686
It's not like my big toe will fly off

131
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:54,311
and turn into a USB drive if you wind up the key,

132
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:56,644
or anything weird and robotic like that!

133
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,686
I'm so dead!

134
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:08,769
♪ Tomorrow the weather will be nice! ♪

135
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,561
Come on, Sekiguchi.

136
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:17,353
Put the book down and let's play something.

137
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:19,186
Please, I even brought the Game of Life

138
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,436
for the two of us to play.

139
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,269
Man, this is so boring.

140
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:30,519
I guess we could try playing Go for
once, or maybe even soccer.

141
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,144
We are the Go+Soccer club.

142
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,853
Um, excuse me!

143
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:37,519
Hello!

144
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:40,103
Is there where I can find the Go+Soccer club?

145
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,269
Yeah?

146
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,811
Are you accepting new members right now?

147
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:48,644
Welcome to the club!

148
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,769
So what do I call ya, kid?

149
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:53,103
I'm Makoto Sakurai, and I'm a first year.

150
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:54,686
Well, my name's Kenzaburou Daiku,

151
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,561
a second year and the club president.

152
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:59,353
And this here's Sekiguchi, who's also a first year.

153
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,144
Come on in and have a seat!

154
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:03,394
Yeah, okay.

155
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:05,186
So, what do you wanna play?

156
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,269
How 'bout a round of this board game.

157
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:10,311
Well, uh, I was hoping that we could practice.

158
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:11,144
For?

159
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:12,894
Um, for Go+Soccer?

160
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:16,478
Don't be silly. That's a fake game I made up.

161
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:19,061
It's not like it's supposed to be a real sport.

162
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:21,686
See, this club is pretty much just about relaxing inside

163
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,186
and playing a few random games every once in a while.

164
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,603
Kinda like a recreational thing. Know what I mean?

165
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:27,811
Sure.

166
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:28,894
Hm?

167
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,311
The thing is,

168
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:32,853
I was actually in a Go+Soccer club in middle school.

169
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:34,061
Uh?

170
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:36,019
And I had absolutely no idea there would be

171
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:38,019
a Go+Soccer club in high school, too.

172
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:39,644
But then I saw those banners

173
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,061
hanging on front of the building.

174
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:43,019
So I had to find the club and join!

175
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:47,519
And not to brag, but I was the
MVP of my middle school club!

176
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:01,769
Uh, Miss Shinonome?

177
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,019
Oh. Yes?

178
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,769
Oh, I just... I was just curious about something.

179
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:08,686
Uh, that thing on your back.

180
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,103
Uh! It's.... Uh, well.

181
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:13,269
Huh? Right. Yeah, no. Uh.

182
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:15,853
--Um. This is-- Uh! --Well, I mean. Um!

183
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:18,603
So then, if Go+Soccer is a real sport,

184
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:19,978
how do you play?

185
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:22,478
Well, it can be kinda complicated,

186
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:24,603
so it'd be better if I show you.

187
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:27,144
Here. I'll give you a little demonstration.

188
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:29,436
First off is the lifting.

189
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,603
After lifting, its Go stones!

190
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:43,144
And then you go into...

191
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,978
...a solo suplex!

192
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,186
And that's the avalanche <i>joseki</i> !

193
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,061
Three Star Point!

194
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,519
That was incredible.

195
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:59,644
I never thought this club would
go anywhere when I started it.

196
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:03,853
But now, it's way cooler than I ever imagined!

197
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,811
Hey, wait up!

198
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:23,894
Where the heck do you think you're running off to?

199
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,686
Buddy! Come back!

200
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:39,686
Sakamoto! C'mere! C'mere! C'mere!

201
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,603
Hey! Are you crazy?! Cut that out!

202
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:46,269
If asked what it is, it is spinning.

203
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,811
That's what I told him.

204
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:20,519
Yeah, you see what I mean, bro?

205
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:21,936
Hey, let's go!

206
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:28,811
I told you we'd make it back early.

207
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:32,311
I can't believe I messed everything up on my first day.

208
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:35,478
Everyone probably thinks I'm crazy.

209
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,769
Oh, hey, Nano, did you bring your own lunch?

210
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,478
Uh, yeah, I did.

211
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:41,228
It looks really tasty.

212
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:42,978
So, do you pack one every day?

213
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:45,061
Yes, I do!

214
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:46,853
Like a normal girl.

215
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:53,269
Hm?

216
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,228
You can look at this.

217
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,186
Wow. It is pretty cool.

218
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:02,561
Thank you!

219
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,728
Oh, hells yeah. I'm right on time.

220
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,519
Uh, no. You're crazy late.

221
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:11,269
Lunch break is almost over already.

222
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:12,519
I'm sorry!

223
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:14,519
My shoes flew off while I was on my way back,

224
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,269
and they got stolen by a car and a dog,

225
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:18,061
so it was a real pain to get 'em back.

226
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:19,311
Huh?

227
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:21,186
That sounds fake, but also kinda interesting.

228
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:23,728
I totally wanna hear the whole story later.

229
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:27,103
But right now, I'm just glad you made it here all right.

230
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:29,353
Hang on. Where's your lunch?

231
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:30,394
Hm?

232
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,019
I ate it while I was on the way back.

233
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,686
Huh? What'd you have?

234
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,603
A twice-cooked pork lunch box.

235
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:37,269
Whoa! How did you even--?

236
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:39,061
Ugh. Never mind.

237
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:43,186
Anyway, did you wanna eat lunch
with the three of us, Nano?

238
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:47,144
I'd really like to hang out with
you and get to know you better.

239
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:49,269
Um, okay.

240
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:50,894
Maybe I didn't freak them out

241
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,769
and they think I'm normal after all.

242
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:55,144
Maybe I can even make some friends!

243
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:57,686
Oh, hey, what's with that strange key thing on your back?

244
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,644
Uh! Uhh...

245
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,769
It's definitely nothing suspicious

246
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,394
if that's what you're asking! So, uh...

247
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,311
You aren't actually like some weird robot girl

248
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:06,394
or something, are ya?

249
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,603
Don't be ridiculous, Yuuko.

250
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:13,519
Sorry, she can be kinda dense.

251
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,686
Oh, we're almost out of time.

252
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:19,019
Sorry, Nano. Let's have lunch together tomorrow.

253
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,478
Let's see.

254
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,686
There's no way they're gonna believe that!

255
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:35,144
Uh...

256
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:38,311
No, seriously.

257
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,353
I climbed the entire mountain
looking for her, and by the...

258
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:42,686
Hey, Yuuko, what did you get me?

259
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:44,894
Hm? I got the <i>yakisaba</i> .

260
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:46,394
...but she's just an urban legend.

261
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:48,394
Could you repeat that one more time, please?

262
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:50,269
Uh. <i>Yakisaba</i> , right?

263
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:51,978
I said <i>yakisoba</i> !

264
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,728
Oh. Well...

265
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,228
I guess I heard you wrong and got you a different thing.

266
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:58,269
Yeah, that's my bad.

267
00:14:58,353 --> 00:14:59,728
Don't act like it's not a big deal!

268
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,269
I asked for noodles and you gave me a fried fish!

269
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:03,603
But can you blame me?

270
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,644
Those two names sound so similar.

271
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:07,103
That's not the--

272
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:08,603
Uh.

273
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:12,353
Whatever. I give up.

274
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:14,353
Just give me my rice.

275
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:15,353
Hm?

276
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,394
What rice?

277
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:17,894
The rice that comes with the fish!

278
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:20,561
Oh. Yeah, no, it's just the fish.

279
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:22,519
How am I supposed to eat this by itself?!

280
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:24,561
Huh? But you didn't clarify when you asked

281
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,103
for the <i>yakisaba</i> in the first place.

282
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:27,936
I asked for <i>yakisoba</i> !

283
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,353
<i>Yaki</i> ! <i>Soba</i> ! They're noodles!

284
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:32,686
'Kay. I get it now.

285
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,019
On the bright side,

286
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:35,728
you could post this whole story on social media

287
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,228
and I bet it'll be hilarious.

288
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,519
I don't own a computer!

289
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:41,061
Aww. Well, it's not my fault

290
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:43,394
you're missing out on a chance to score some likes.

291
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:46,144
All right, fine. I'll run out again and get you your food.

292
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:47,686
I just need money.

293
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,478
Why should I be the one who has to pay for your mistakes?

294
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:51,394
'Cause I don't have any money left on me.

295
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:52,686
Uh?

296
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:56,061
Okay, fine. Just hurry up and come back quick.

297
00:15:56,144 --> 00:15:58,019
We hardly have any time left.

298
00:15:58,103 --> 00:16:00,019
You can count on me!

299
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,603
That's all I have.

300
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:05,311
Wha--?

301
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,144
One peso is all I have!

302
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:08,894
I can't believe the only money in my wallet

303
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:10,936
is this peso I kept as a souvenir.

304
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,103
Huh?

305
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:14,269
What can I do with a single peso?

306
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:15,603
One peso?

307
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:17,103
I don't know!

308
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:18,269
You're the one who caused this mess in the first place!

309
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,644
You should be the one to pay for it!

310
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,019
I already spent all my money

311
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,686
when I bought my lunch, so I don't have any more.

312
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:25,103
And what am I supposed to do about my lunch?

313
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:29,186
Well, I guess... you could eat...

314
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:30,019
...the mackerel.

315
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:32,561
Mackerel?! Ugh!

316
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:34,728
You're just a never-ending cycle of pissing me off!

317
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:37,353
And I'm sick of letting you copy my homework every day!

318
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:39,769
Why don't you just do it by yourself for a change?!

319
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:41,936
You idiot!

320
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,478
I understand that you're upset,

321
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,186
but the fact that I'm an idiot
has absolutely nothing to do

322
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,811
with me getting your lunch order wrong.

323
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,019
It has everything to do with it!

324
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:49,686
Yeah? I'd like to hear why!

325
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,019
Only an idiot would mishear me like that!

326
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:53,978
Hmph.

327
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:55,103
Everyone's guilty of making

328
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,728
a few mistakes sometimes, ya know!

329
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:59,394
But you just have to overreact!
It's not the end of the world!

330
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,144
I didn't eat breakfast, so I needed that lunch

331
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,561
to keep me from starving all day!

332
00:17:02,644 --> 00:17:04,644
I wouldn't expect an idiot like you to understand!

333
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:06,061
I'm not an idiot!

334
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:08,144
You just said you were an idiot earlier!

335
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,103
Oh, and FYI, I'm never letting
you copy my homework ever again,

336
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:12,436
so good luck!

337
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,019
Yeah, that's fine! But this is a two-way street!

338
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:16,269
If I can't copy your homework,
then you can't copy mine either!

339
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:18,519
Why would I wanna copy your homework in the first place?

340
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,394
Your answers would be as wrong as my lunch order!

341
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:22,478
Which you never apologized for, by the way!

342
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:24,769
So get on your knees and apologize right now!

343
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:26,853
Fine, if that's what you really want,

344
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:29,186
I guess I should just bend over then!

345
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:30,519
How's that?

346
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:32,144
This good enough for you, Miss Perfect Hearing?

347
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:35,394
There's my apology! Are you happy now?! Are ya?!

348
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:38,019
What?! You call that weird pose you did a bow?

349
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:40,853
No! It wasn't a bow because I was just stretching!

350
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,894
And I'm never gonna bow to you! Fool!

351
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,436
Why can't you just admit that you messed up?

352
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,019
Because you pissed me off!

353
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:53,394
Also, calling me an idiot would make you a hypocrite.

354
00:17:53,478 --> 00:17:55,269
Did you remember those weird doodles you drew?

355
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:56,019
'Cause I do!

356
00:17:57,186 --> 00:17:59,394
Wait, the doodles were, uh...

357
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,269
You moron, those were just--

358
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:02,519
What were they?

359
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:04,103
Go ahead and tell me!

360
00:18:04,186 --> 00:18:06,269
I'm an idiot, so I won't get it
unless you spell it out for me!

361
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,019
Go ahead!

362
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:08,644
You moron!

363
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:10,561
You're a complete and utter moron!

364
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:11,978
Ugh! Who's the moron?!

365
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,894
Only a real moron would draw these weird sketches

366
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:15,061
and leave them out in the open!

367
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,728
Come on, I want you to taste defeat!

368
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,269
Eat it along with this <i>yakisaba</i> !

369
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:20,853
I wanted <i>yakisoba</i> !

370
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:22,311
Would you apologize already?

371
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,061
Get down on your knobby knees right now!

372
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,394
I apologized earlier!

373
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:26,936
Was that not good enough for you?

374
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,728
Apologize like you mean it,
or you're just a waste of space!

375
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,228
All right, fine!

376
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:34,144
I'll show you the ultimate bow to end all bows!

377
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:35,769
Behold its glory!

378
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:40,436
The one true bow!

379
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,853
Hmph. I see the bow, but I don't hear an apology!

380
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,769
What are you sorry for? Tell me!

381
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:49,228
Say that you're sorry for messing up my order!

382
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:50,478
Say it!

383
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,144
Say that you're an idiot that messes things up!

384
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:53,478
And you're just a useless human being

385
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:54,853
that can't get anything right!

386
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:57,311
Come on! I'm waiting! Do it already!

387
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:58,811
Are you not listening?

388
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:01,144
Apologize, you moron!

389
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,519
Worthless! Idiot! Moron!

390
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:19,436
I'm sick and tired of you constantly calling me a moron!

391
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,519
You don't even know me!

392
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:21,894
We've only been friends for like, what,

393
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,228
six lousy months now?

394
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:24,519
I could say the same about you!

395
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:26,269
You don't understand me or my drawings!

396
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:27,436
I do understand!

397
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,978
Your drawings are so good

398
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:31,186
that you might as well become a professional manga artist!

399
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:37,353
Uh! What are you talking about? Stop being stupid, stupid.

400
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:38,853
Huh?

401
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:41,394
Well, if I'm stupid, then you're stupid, too, so suck it!

402
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:43,186
You just called yourself stupid.

403
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:44,519
I did not!

404
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:46,436
But you did!

405
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,519
But that stupid side of you isn't all that bad.

406
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,144
What are you saying? You've got the good side!

407
00:19:58,228 --> 00:20:02,519
Uh. Hey, you stop it now, with your positive energy.

408
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:05,436
Well, I think you're way too
talented at drawing art things!

409
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,269
Shut up! You run too fast!

410
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:08,394
Well, you're too smart!

411
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:09,686
Well, you're optimistic!

412
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:10,853
You're a great person!

413
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:13,019
You're a super fun person!

414
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,728
Amazing!

415
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:45,228
Captain! I'm sorry. We tried!

416
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,894
Save your tears. We always have next year.

417
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:50,519
I'll win it! I'll win for him!

418
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:52,936
Woohoo!

419
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:57,353
Those were the days.

420
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:01,103
Hey, Nano,

421
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:03,894
did you have fun on your very first day?

422
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:05,144
I sure did.

423
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:08,644
So many things happened. It was kinda like...

424
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:11,061
Oo, like what? Tell me about it!

425
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,478
I love having friends!

426
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:14,478
It's the greatest feeling in the whole world!

427
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:17,353
That sounds amazing!

428
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:20,186
Come on. You're both getting too excited.

429
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:23,644
Huh? One of these?

430
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:30,019
Hakase!

431
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:32,894
Please take this key off of my back!

432
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:33,728
Uh...

433
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:34,561
No way.

434
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:36,311
Huh? But why not?

435
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,644
It's having a negative impact on my life at school!

436
00:21:39,728 --> 00:21:41,394
People are already starting to suspect

437
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:43,103
that I might really be a robot!

438
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:45,811
And that makes it harder for me to make friends.

439
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:48,269
You can to make friends. Your key is pretty.

440
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:49,478
I don't think it is.

441
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:51,478
But it's cute. And it's a key.

442
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:52,894
But why?

443
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,561
Just hurry up and give me my food.

444
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:28,519
It's soccer ball here.

445
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:31,478
All I do is get kicked around, day in and day out.

446
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:34,644
Kicked and crushed until I deflate and get put to rest!

447
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:36,394
I don't even have goals!

448
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:39,353
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 15.

449
00:23:39,436 --> 00:23:41,061
Look forward to it!
