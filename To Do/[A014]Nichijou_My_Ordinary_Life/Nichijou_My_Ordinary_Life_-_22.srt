1
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:20,718
Everything in this world

2
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:23,176
can be explained by science.

3
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:26,593
Our society is infatuated

4
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:29,135
by things like ghosts and paranormal phenomena,

5
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:32,093
but such stupid stuff couldn't possibly be real!

6
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:34,176
They can't exist.

7
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:39,301
Which is why...

8
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:43,093
...I refuse to believe in spirits!

9
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,801
I stopped by my local temple

10
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:20,135
to ask for a so-called "exorcism."

11
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:23,301
Hmm. Now, what can I help you with today, young man?

12
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:25,676
If I act like I'm possessed by an evil spirit,

13
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,218
I can call him out on his nonsense when he tries to help.

14
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:30,801
My throat's been kinda sore lately,

15
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,843
and it almost feels like someone, or something,

16
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:34,176
is strangling me.

17
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,301
Oh?

18
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:37,718
Try this.

19
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,176
It should clear that right up.

20
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,426
I knew it!

21
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,760
He's probably gonna give me some sort of trinket

22
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:43,760
to ward away evil or something!

23
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:47,426
Those cough drops help with

24
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,010
all kinds of throat pain.

25
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:51,676
Well, I guess that's a perfectly logical solution.

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,468
Maybe my symptoms weren't supernatural enough for him.

27
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:56,176
It looks like I'm gonna have to go further

28
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,718
to make him believe me!

29
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,385
Huh?

30
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:00,593
You don't get it!

31
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:02,885
This isn't just some ordinary sore throat!

32
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,635
It's like...

33
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,593
...I can feel someone's hands around my neck, choking me!

34
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:09,093
And when it gets really bad,

35
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:11,635
I start making these creepy noises against my will.

36
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:13,635
It's almost like I'm possessed!

37
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:15,635
Well. That's something.

38
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,968
Maybe lay off the horror movies.

39
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:20,718
And, uh... go away.

40
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,260
I never expected that

41
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:25,551
this paranormal professional would just

42
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:27,135
shoot me down like that.

43
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:29,010
Then again, I guess I didn't double check

44
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,301
if he actually did believe in spirits.

45
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:34,301
But whatever. I can't let this trip be for nothing!

46
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:37,176
I'm not gonna leave without giving it my best shot!

47
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,260
I can feel something sinister

48
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:42,176
trying to choke the life out of me right now!

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,843
I'm sorry!

50
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:57,551
He wasn't fooled at all!

51
00:03:57,635 --> 00:03:58,801
Of course he wasn't.

52
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:00,176
I'll have to commit to my performance

53
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,301
if I'm gonna have any chance at convincing an expert!

54
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:05,510
I've really gotta sell this.

55
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:10,135
If I want him to buy it, I have to take it to the limit!

56
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:15,843
Huh? What the?

57
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,176
Stop! Whatever you're doing!

58
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,593
What is the matter with you?

59
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:32,260
You're going off the rails!

60
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:34,718
Chug-a, chug-a choo-choo!

61
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:36,968
Chug-a, chug-a choo-choo! Chug-a, chug-a choo-choo!

62
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:40,218
That's not funny!

63
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,885
Cut it out!

64
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:53,885
Chug-a, chug-a... Chug-a, chug-a...

65
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,468
Damn you!

66
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:01,551
I cannot allow this!

67
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,801
How dare you defile my temple!

68
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:10,468
When I grow up,

69
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,551
I want to become a brilliant scientist.

70
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:17,218
Aw crap.

71
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:19,551
I went a little overboard.

72
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:21,468
I believe that everything on this planet

73
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,426
can be explained by science.

74
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,010
And one day, I hope to spread knowledge and understanding

75
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,385
throughout the world.

76
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:30,468
When that day comes, I have but one piece of wisdom.

77
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,968
Are you okay, sir?

78
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,385
Leave.

79
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,093
Get out of my temple, you demon!

80
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:41,051
That is: there's a demon inside all of us, you see.

81
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,343
--Gotcha! --Hey!

82
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:57,843
Who the--

83
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,343
Long time no see, Mihoshi!

84
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,426
Yeah? Well, same to you!

85
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:08,635
The last time we saw each other,

86
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:10,968
you weren't even in middle school yet, were you?

87
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:14,093
That's 'cause you stopped coming to the dojo forever ago.

88
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:15,260
Yeah, well,

89
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,843
I just don't really have any motivation

90
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,281
to keep up with my training.

91
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:19,106
--Like, ever. --Huh?

92
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:22,468
You never train but you still
won the national championship?!

93
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,676
You stupid, lazy prodigy!

94
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,010
Heading to the dojo?

95
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:27,926
Yeah, since I'm done with

96
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,676
all my school stuff for today.

97
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,218
You wanna come with me?

98
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:32,635
Hmm.

99
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:34,760
I feel like I actually get worse the more I practice,

100
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,885
so I think I'm gonna have to pass.

101
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:38,093
Are you kidding me?

102
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:40,843
You frustratingly talented moron!

103
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,926
How skilled she is isn't what bothers me.

104
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,551
I just can't stand that she got so good

105
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:49,551
without training as hard as the rest of us.

106
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:51,926
I heard that during her first year of middle school,

107
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,718
she was able to score a point
against one of the instructors!

108
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,510
Almost like it was nothing!

109
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,635
I'm in middle school now,

110
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,760
and I'm not even close to that level.

111
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,385
I go to the dojo every day to try and improve,

112
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:05,426
even on the weekends!

113
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,885
My instructor told me that my hard work'll pay off,

114
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:09,843
and that's what I wanna believe!

115
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:11,635
Aw, look! It's a kitty cat!

116
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:14,968
Hey, little guy, you sleepin'?

117
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:18,385
Being around her is so infuriating.

118
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:19,676
I can't stand it.

119
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,551
Aw, you're just the cutest!

120
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:24,218
If only I could land a single blow.

121
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:26,135
Just one strike.

122
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:29,468
This might be the only way for me right now.

123
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:30,801
But maybe someday,

124
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:34,260
I could land one in a real match, against her,

125
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:35,968
and even the instructors!

126
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:38,885
Then we'll see who the prodigy is!

127
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,176
I'm so sorry!

128
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,843
Instructor?!

129
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,260
I'm freezing.

130
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:13,801
Okay. It's your time to shine.

131
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:14,843
My father wants me to

132
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,593
follow in his footsteps so badly.

133
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,260
Hold on to this balloon.

134
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:20,135
Give it to a kid if one passes by.

135
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:21,718
But he can't make me do it.

136
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,760
So, I'm gonna find a way out!

137
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,926
This is humiliating, and...

138
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,260
...this thing doesn't even float!

139
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:53,801
At the end of the day,

140
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:57,760
everyone hopes at least to see a happy ending.

141
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:07,801
So, do you know what you're

142
00:09:07,885 --> 00:09:10,093
asking Santa for this year, Hakase?

143
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,635
Yeah, I know!

144
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,426
Some chocolate snacks, new colored pencils,

145
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,801
and some cake erasers, and um, some, uh...

146
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:20,718
Wow! If you're asking for all that, then...

147
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,926
...I'll come up with the stuff I want.

148
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,635
Like two dozen more eggs, a gallon of two-percent milk,

149
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:28,218
and maybe an Ivan Bilibin book.

150
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,760
I asked for a buncha stuff first,

151
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:32,010
and there's no room for Santa to carry any more presents,

152
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,801
so you only get one!

153
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,468
Really?

154
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:39,635
Wait, don't cry.

155
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:41,843
Maybe you can have more than one present.

156
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:44,218
I think you can ask for a little bit of a lot of stuff

157
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:45,885
if you wanna.

158
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:48,718
You wanna borrow my Santa hat?

159
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:53,676
Helvetica Standard.

160
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,676
Ho, ho, ho!

161
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,635
Oh, wow! It's Santa!

162
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,385
Merry Christmas--

163
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:33,176
I'm not gonna be part of

164
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,801
this embarrassment anymore!

165
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,385
Time for the mask to come off!

166
00:10:37,468 --> 00:10:38,218
Ow!

167
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:41,635
Trying to escape, Tsyoshi?

168
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:42,926
Father?

169
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,593
I took some "precautions" with that headpiece

170
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:45,510
this time around.

171
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:46,885
Precautions?

172
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:49,801
That mask's not coming offa your head.

173
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:52,343
Because...

174
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:54,301
...it's glued on!

175
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:10,885
Ah, hot!

176
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:13,468
Dang it! I just bought that meat bun!

177
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:15,551
And I didn't even get to take a bite out of it yet.

178
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,926
Just look on the bright side!

179
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,801
If that meat bun was actually filled with poison,

180
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:20,968
you might've gotten sick or died or something.

181
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:22,468
So, you dodged a bullet!

182
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,010
Whatever.

183
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:26,551
I wanted to eat that snack and now I
can't, and that sucks.

184
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:27,593
Don't sweat the negatives!

185
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:29,176
If you try to think positively,

186
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,010
then good luck will come your way for sure!

187
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:32,718
Everything is gonna work out.

188
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:34,051
Trust me.

189
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,426
What's got you in such a chipper mood all of a sudden?

190
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,926
Well, you see,

191
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,051
I just realized that no matter how bad things might seem,

192
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,176
there's always a bright side.

193
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,218
For example, you can peel off the dirty bottom,

194
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:48,468
and then your bun's fine!

195
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,468
What happened to it being poisoned?

196
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,093
See? You can work your way around it like this,

197
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,510
and it'll be--ow!

198
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,510
Whoa!

199
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,426
And it's safe. Woo!

200
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,843
Ya see that?

201
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:04,010
If that's not the power of positivity, then what is?

202
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:05,676
You can't make this stuff up!

203
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,676
I think my meat bun would say otherwise.

204
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,718
Aw, cheer up!

205
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:10,510
Remember to look on the bright side!

206
00:12:10,593 --> 00:12:12,885
If you actually did eat that poisonous meat bun,

207
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:13,968
you'd be a goner.

208
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,843
That's your only hypothetical?

209
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:18,885
Even if I peel the bottom off at this point,

210
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:21,968
your popsicle contaminated the top of it with your spit.

211
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:22,885
Don't say that!

212
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:24,718
Remember! Positivity!

213
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:25,926
Oh, no!

214
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,135
It looks like the bun is still hot enough

215
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:29,135
to melt your popsicle a little bit.

216
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:32,010
If I just pretend that it was poisoned,

217
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:33,343
then everything's fine.

218
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:35,260
But you already ate some of it.

219
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:38,426
What's wrong?

220
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,135
So much for positivity bringing good luck!

221
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:43,968
No! This is a sign telling me that

222
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,760
I would've gotten a stomach
ache if I ate another popsicle.

223
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:48,926
Wow. You sure are sticking to your guns

224
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,385
despite all the crappy luck.

225
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:51,676
And look closely.

226
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,385
This would've been completely done for

227
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,093
if it was soft ice cream or something.

228
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:56,510
But since it's made out of solid ice,

229
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:58,260
I might still be able to clean it off.

230
00:12:58,343 --> 00:12:59,343
Good as new.

231
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:00,260
Bright side!

232
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:01,968
You're still gonna eat that?

233
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:06,426
Uh...

234
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:10,676
Wait! Wait!

235
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,510
Uh...

236
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:39,093
So, how bad is it?

237
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:41,551
Your butt is totally soaked.

238
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:44,676
Anyway!

239
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,176
What about the bright side?

240
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,301
Aw, screw it! I give up!

241
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,260
Accept the fact that you're

242
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,010
meant to carry on my legacy.

243
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:10,635
I'll continue to glue things to
you until that reality sticks!

244
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:15,468
Father.

245
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,926
Hm?

246
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,260
You can take...

247
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:21,718
What?

248
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,260
...your <i>daifuku</i> ...

249
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:25,176
It can't be!

250
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:35,926
...and go shove it!

251
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:41,593
Misato, what are your goals and plans for the future?

252
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:43,051
Uh...

253
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:45,135
Right now I'm still deciding if I want to go to college

254
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,760
or become a professional chef.

255
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:50,051
Really? A chef, huh?

256
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,176
And, uh... I might, kinda, sorta, possibly, maybe...

257
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,635
...marry that goat guy!

258
00:14:59,718 --> 00:15:02,010
Let's not get carried away, now.

259
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:07,551
Tie it around here...

260
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:09,760
And good to go!

261
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,010
I'm home!

262
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,176
Hey! Nano!

263
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,468
I was about to take Sakamoto for a walk.

264
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:15,593
Some friends of mine wanted to

265
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:17,260
come over to study later today.

266
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:18,135
Is that all right?

267
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,635
Fine by me!

268
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,176
As long as I get to play with you guys when I get back.

269
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,010
'Kay then, I'm off now!

270
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:24,926
'Kay!

271
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,843
Hey, get this off of me right now!

272
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,051
You're gonna choke me to death

273
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:32,343
if you keep on dragging me around like that!

274
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,718
All right, fine!

275
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:37,885
I'll give you anything you want if you let me go!

276
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:39,135
So, what do you want?

277
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:40,260
A shark.

278
00:15:40,343 --> 00:15:41,301
Are you freakin' kidding me?

279
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:44,843
♪ Walking alone and crying tears. ♪

280
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:46,510
I'm the one who is legit crying!

281
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:47,635
So if you'll please just untie me,

282
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:49,135
I promise I'll get you a shark!

283
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:50,343
Hear me? I'll do it!

284
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:52,260
I'm dyin' here!

285
00:15:56,885 --> 00:16:01,010
Dogs!

286
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,510
Everyone knows dogs could bite at any moment.

287
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:05,218
Isn't that right, kitty?

288
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,135
Dogs bite whenever they feel like, huh?

289
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:09,051
What, uh--what are you freaking out about?

290
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,468
It's just a couple of dogs.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

291
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,885
They've got leashes on, so it's fine!

292
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,135
We've gotta get outta here, kid!

293
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:20,676
Okay! Run!

294
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,426
Sakamoto! We've been trapped!

295
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,551
Don't give up! That's just what they want you to do!

296
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:27,926
We can tell their owner to call them off

297
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,426
and put their leashes back on!

298
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:33,635
Crap! We're so dead!

299
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:35,218
Come on, we have to think of somethin'!

300
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,051
Anything at all!

301
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,093
Or else it'll be over!

302
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,426
Or maybe it's already over.

303
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,385
It is, isn't it?

304
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:41,051
We're done! We're dead! We're...

305
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:42,718
I found a gummy in my pocket.

306
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,135
That's great!

307
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:45,968
You can use that to distract them while we get away!

308
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,260
I know! Why don't you make an invention

309
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:53,426
that'll get us outta here?

310
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,051
Oh, yeah! That's a great idea!

311
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:56,635
But hang on!

312
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:57,843
What?

313
00:16:57,926 --> 00:16:59,301
I don't have my tools to make inventions!

314
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,218
Dammit!

315
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:03,593
I give up!

316
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:04,760
Boil me, grill me, do whatever you want

317
00:17:04,843 --> 00:17:06,343
as long as it's quick!

318
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,176
Boil me?

319
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,176
Grill me?

320
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,468
Whatever you want...?

321
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:13,968
Food?

322
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:17,051
But I don't wanna be food, 'cause then I'll be eaten.

323
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:20,093
I don't wanna be eaten, 'cause then I can't eat anymore!

324
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,051
Huh? Hakase?

325
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:26,301
What are you up to?

326
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:27,135
Are ya lost?

327
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,551
Yuuko!

328
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:31,051
Whoa! So you're the Hakase I've heard so much about!

329
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,635
Hey, you brought Sakamoto!

330
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,093
I'mma give him some pets, 'kay?

331
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:35,593
Hang on, Yuuko!

332
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:36,676
Help us with the dogs!

333
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,926
Aw, he's even fluffier than I imagined!

334
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,426
I wanna pet him after you're done!

335
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,593
I'm not messing around!

336
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,218
We have to stop these bloodthirsty dogs!

337
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,176
Wait a sec, one of the dogs bit you

338
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,760
and you wanna get it back?

339
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:48,051
No! But it looks like it's gonna bite me! I can tell!

340
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:51,551
I guess that explains why you're a cat person.

341
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:52,551
Am I right?

342
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:53,510
No, you're not!

343
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:55,218
Dogs are bite-y! I know they are!

344
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:56,510
Aw, but just look at 'em.

345
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:57,885
There's no way they would hurt anyone.

346
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:58,718
They will, too!

347
00:17:58,801 --> 00:17:59,885
No they won't.

348
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:01,593
They will!

349
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:02,635
If they chew,

350
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:03,468
I gave gum!

351
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:06,343
That's not funny!

352
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:08,051
C'mon, I'll show you.

353
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,218
All right, shake--

354
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:30,260
Looked like that hurt.

355
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,510
Are you okay?

356
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,760
They won't bite as long as you
keep your distance from them,

357
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:37,260
so don't worry about it.

358
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:39,718
I told her, but Yuuko still...

359
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:40,885
It's fine.

360
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,510
That kind of stuff always happens to her.

361
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:44,051
If you say so.

362
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,635
Come on, then.

363
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:48,510
Let's grab Yuuko and head back to your place to see Nano.

364
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:50,718
Wait, you know Nano?

365
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:51,968
Of course I--

366
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:25,010
Where the heck did you go?

367
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:27,676
Don't you know you need to keep those beasts on a leash?

368
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,968
Did you play with them?

369
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:32,968
Don't be ridiculous!

370
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:34,468
They were gonna kill me to death!

371
00:19:43,468 --> 00:19:44,718
Here you go.

372
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:46,135
Shark Choco!

373
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,135
Thank you very much, nice lady.

374
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,968
Well I got some chocolate and we saw some puppies.

375
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:53,510
I'd say that was a nice walk.

376
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:54,926
Yeah right!

377
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,885
I saw you practically pee your lab coat back there.

378
00:19:56,968 --> 00:19:59,176
Now that that's over, can you take this rope off?

379
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,301
I have my snack now, so sure!

380
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:05,385
Huh?

381
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:06,760
What's wrong?

382
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:08,635
The rope is stuck. Help me.

383
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:10,468
What makes you think I can help?

384
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:13,260
Maybe they can help us get it off.

385
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:17,676
Hey, Yuuko. Get up. Hey!

386
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,801
You gotta help me.

387
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,301
Yuuko, I gotta problem.

388
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:23,510
Hey. Isn't that, uh...

389
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:26,051
Uh--huh?

390
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:48,718
I'm home!

391
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:50,301
There're too many dogs out there.

392
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:52,176
Huh? You're all sweaty!

393
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,218
Oh, I forgot!

394
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:54,426
I have chocolate!

395
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,593
Huh?

396
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:58,510
♪ Choco, choco, chocolate! ♪

397
00:20:58,593 --> 00:21:00,885
♪ Choco, choco, chocolate! ♪

398
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,843
I'm getting worried about Yuuko and Mio.

399
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:05,343
They don't usually take this long to get here.

400
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:08,385
♪ Sharky, sharky, chocolatey shark! ♪

401
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:19,426
I think they went this way.

402
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,010
What the heck happened here?

403
00:21:22,093 --> 00:21:24,301
Buddy! Li'l-Buddy!

404
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:26,843
What did you guys do?

405
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:30,635
Grandpa!

406
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:32,510
As people, we must always be there

407
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:34,385
to help each other, Takashi.

408
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:35,718
Uh...

409
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,343
Also, that same compassion

410
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:39,968
lives in the hearts of animals, too, Takashi.

411
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:41,635
Uh...

412
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,551
The bond between humans and animals

413
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,218
is one that can never be forgotten, Takashi.

414
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:50,551
Uh...

415
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:52,093
Hey, Grandpa?

416
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:54,843
I'm Kiyoshi.

417
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:27,843
I'm Melon Bread.

418
00:23:27,926 --> 00:23:30,426
Simple humans bicker for all eternity

419
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,218
over whether or not I should taste like actual melon.

420
00:23:33,301 --> 00:23:35,468
Truly a question for the ages.

421
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:39,010
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 23.

422
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:40,676
Look forward to it!
