1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,678
Was Sasahara was actually asleep in there?

2
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:09,095
Uh, yeah, totally.

3
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,678
Didn't you see him? He was 100 percent taking a nap.

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,637
Ooh, you should go wake him up, Misato.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,637
Huh?

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,178
He probably isn't aware that we're

7
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:18,553
changing classrooms right now, so you should let him know.

8
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:20,470
That's not my responsibility!

9
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:21,720
Why should I care?

10
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:23,137
Come on, don't be like that.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,512
He's your friend, isn't he?

12
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:25,803
It's not a big deal.

13
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:27,012
And besides,

14
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:28,345
you'll probably have the room to yourselves

15
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,178
if you're feelin' feisty.

16
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:32,303
Huh? What? No way!

17
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:33,928
Well, have fun, you two!

18
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:35,428
Tell us the details later!

19
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:38,303
No! You--!

20
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:40,845
Why do I have to be stuck with babysitting that idiot?

21
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:42,678
Just because we've known each other forever.

22
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:44,720
You should just confess your feelings to him already!

23
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:28,928
Sasahara!

24
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,887
We're changing classrooms, so would you get up?

25
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,137
We gotta go!

26
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,970
Uh--it's you.

27
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:36,262
Miss Tachibana.

28
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:40,845
Just go and grab whatever you need for the next class.

29
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,512
Of course.

30
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,137
I only intended to rest my eyes for a moment,

31
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,887
but it seems as though I must have been lulled to sleep.

32
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,970
I don't give a crap about any of that!

33
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,595
Get your stuff before people get the wrong idea.

34
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:54,345
Wrong idea? How so?

35
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,678
Just forget it!

36
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:02,512
I'm so sorry!

37
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,053
I mean, I'm not sorry for doing it,

38
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:06,053
I'm sorry it that happened, I mean.

39
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:08,220
Who puts their glasses on a desk anyway?

40
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:09,970
Misato Tachibana.

41
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:12,095
Look. Your hand is bleeding.

42
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,303
You don't have to act all nice, y'know.

43
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:19,512
I broke your glasses,

44
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:22,053
so you have every right to be angry with me.

45
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:23,345
Why?

46
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:25,762
Glasses feel no pain when they're broken.

47
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:27,012
You're the one who's hurting.

48
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,178
Yeah, no duh!

49
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:32,303
My hand's bleeding!

50
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:33,845
That much is obvious!

51
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:35,178
Fortunately for us,

52
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:37,928
one of the lenses is still in its rightful place.

53
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,428
As long as the lens hangs on to the glasses, so will I.

54
00:03:52,887 --> 00:03:55,678
It's like the glasses somehow knew...

55
00:03:57,178 --> 00:03:58,637
...and let go.

56
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:04,553
Follow me.

57
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:05,428
You really don't--

58
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,512
I know!

59
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:08,970
But I have to take responsibility.

60
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:10,428
It's my fault!

61
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:12,803
You get what I'm saying?

62
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:14,512
It was totally lame, right?

63
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:16,720
That's why, uh...

64
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:20,095
Yeah, totally.

65
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,470
And then I said--uh...

66
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:26,470
Oh, man, everyone is staring!

67
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:27,970
I could die. I'm dying!

68
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:29,720
I am literally dead right now.

69
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,012
But I have to do this.

70
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:32,970
Sasahara's probably blind without his glasses,

71
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:34,637
so I have to be his eyes.

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,095
It's fine. No big deal.

73
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:38,178
His glasses are broken, so this isn't weird, right?

74
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:40,678
Totally, 100 percent understandable.

75
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:42,762
Yeah! I'm helping out a person in need!

76
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:43,970
Like a seeing-eye dog.

77
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:46,553
An embarrassed, dying, seeing-eye dog.

78
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:47,845
Excuse me, Miss Tachibana.

79
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:49,595
Uh, yeah?

80
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:51,095
Before we reach the classroom,

81
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:53,053
I'd like to take a visit to the facilities.

82
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,428
Wait! So... the bathroom?

83
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:56,678
The boy's bathroom?

84
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,387
Naturally.

85
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,387
This'll be harder than I thought!

86
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:03,512
But I can't back down now.

87
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,012
I have to do this for him.

88
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,137
For us!

89
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:09,845
Fine! I'll go in with you!

90
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:11,262
But why?

91
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,512
Because your glasses are broken, aren't they?

92
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:13,928
They are.

93
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,678
Come on! Don't make me spell it out for you!

94
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:16,928
Your glasses are broken!

95
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,678
So, uh... since it was my fault,

96
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,553
I'm gonna be your eyes for today.

97
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:23,970
Oh. These are just for style.

98
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:26,803
Don't get the wrong idea!

99
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:29,053
I wasn't holding your arm because I wanted to or anything!

100
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:30,303
There was a bug on your sleeve

101
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,595
and I was just trying to squish it very slowly.

102
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:35,303
What beautiful weather today.

103
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,553
Uh--

104
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:52,053
Huh?

105
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,220
Uh--! So, uh,

106
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:59,387
I know this spicy curry place in Kamakura!

107
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,678
Oh! That's nice!

108
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:03,303
How spicy do you like your food, Ms. Sakurai?

109
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:05,845
Oh? Well, uh...

110
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:07,178
No spice at all.

111
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:08,928
Same! What a coincidence!

112
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,470
Uh...

113
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:20,637
So, um... our next class.

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,220
We're going to be late.

115
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:24,470
We're going to be late.

116
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:25,637
Wait, Mio!

117
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,428
The classroom is in the other direction!

118
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,053
The other direction.

119
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,595
Try to think of it this way!

120
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:31,720
Life is just like baseball,

121
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,512
and sometimes you end up striking out!

122
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,095
But you can't stop playing the game!

123
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,178
Sometimes you end up striking out.

124
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,678
Just like baseball.

125
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:40,220
Let's not jump to conclusions!

126
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:42,137
We don't even know if those two
are actually a thing or not!

127
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,303
Back me up on this, Nano!

128
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:44,803
Huh? Oh. Yeah!

129
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:45,803
What she said!

130
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:47,470
But, Koujirou...

131
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,178
He couldn't.

132
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,887
He wouldn't.

133
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,512
He did.

134
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:56,970
Anyway, we should get going. Come on, Mio.

135
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,012
--Mio! --Come back!

136
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,803
Nano! You get to class and buy us some time!

137
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,053
I'll take care of her!

138
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:03,887
Right!

139
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,428
Mio, wait!

140
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,387
Mio! That's a window!

141
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:14,678
Mio!

142
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,678
Mio!

143
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:18,428
Mio, wait!

144
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:24,012
Mio!

145
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:32,470
Mi-oh!

146
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,220
Mio!

147
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:35,512
--Huh? --Mio!

148
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,845
Uh! Mio?

149
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,553
Hey! Mio?

150
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:51,387
Mio! Mio!

151
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,720
--Say cheese! --Wait, Mio!

152
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:54,720
Mio!

153
00:07:58,803 --> 00:07:59,845
Mio!

154
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,887
This is my stop.

155
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,553
Mio!

156
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,387
Mio! Watch out!

157
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,137
Look, Mio!

158
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,095
Mio!

159
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:21,012
Mio!

160
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:22,095
Mio, stop!

161
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:23,970
Mio! Mio!

162
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,387
Maa fell in the river!

163
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,678
Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio!

164
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:41,637
Dammit all!

165
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,345
Mi-o-my!

166
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:54,720
<i>Dios Mio</i> !

167
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:19,428
Thank you.

168
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:23,678
Hey, Mio!

169
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,137
I thought I lost you back there!

170
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:38,345
I'm fine.

171
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:41,637
I just need to breathe.

172
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,803
Well, that's good.

173
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:44,137
Where is he?

174
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,678
This way!

175
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:46,845
There you are, Maa!

176
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:47,720
Osamu!

177
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:49,053
Thank goodness you're safe!

178
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:50,428
You all right?

179
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:52,220
Yeah, I think so.

180
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:55,762
If this lady didn't save me, I'd be in big trouble.

181
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,095
Wait! You again?

182
00:09:58,012 --> 00:09:59,262
From before!

183
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:00,803
I hope the two of you are aware

184
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:02,845
that interfering with official police business

185
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:04,262
is a criminal offense!

186
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:05,970
But I didn't do anything!

187
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,428
Under normal circumstances,

188
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:10,012
I would report this directly to your school.

189
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,595
But in this case,
I suppose I can overlook it just this once.

190
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:16,595
Do you mean it?

191
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:19,387
Ah, there you are!

192
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,845
I've finally caught up to you and your little pigtails.

193
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:26,095
I saw your shadow boxing.

194
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:28,262
And you have a true gift.

195
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,345
Uh...

196
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:33,928
What about it?

197
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:36,928
With your talents...

198
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,720
...you could rule the boxing world.

199
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,553
Help! Help! He stole my bag!

200
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:44,637
Don't think badly of me!

201
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,095
Well! Duty calls!

202
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,345
Come to the station later

203
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:49,553
and you'll get a commendation for your help!

204
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:52,012
Here, lady. This is for you.

205
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:53,845
Thanks.

206
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:57,845
--Osamu, that okay? --Yeah!

207
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:58,803
Whenever you're ready,

208
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,845
please visit me at my gym,

209
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:03,470
and then your journey can begin.

210
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:05,512
Oh, no! Mio, you lost your English textbook

211
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:06,345
during all that madness!

212
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:14,803
Mio?

213
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,928
Rejected before I could confess.

214
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:20,053
Rescued a child while running from my own troubles.

215
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,595
Received an award and a kite.

216
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,512
Got scouted by a boxing coach.

217
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:27,678
In a way, life really is just like baseball.

218
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:29,220
I have to keep playing the game.

219
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:30,262
Huh?

220
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:32,387
Isn't that what you told me before?

221
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,178
Who knows what'll happen.

222
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:35,803
So keep going.

223
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:36,970
That right?

224
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:39,928
Huh? What's right?

225
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:41,345
You get it.

226
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:54,512
I just realized

227
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:57,387
that daydreaming is totally free.

228
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:09,720
Damn. I completely lost track of her.

229
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:11,845
I was hot on her trail

230
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,762
when she was running around the school,

231
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,928
but I took my eyes off her for a moment,

232
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:17,928
and she suddenly slipped away!

233
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:19,470
Huh?

234
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:21,887
A remarkable and surprising feature!

235
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,137
I must know more about your advanced functionalities,

236
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,678
Nano Shinonome!

237
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:30,012
Now then, I've traveled this far.

238
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:32,178
Perhaps I should try locating her home.

239
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:35,803
Hmm, on second thought,
it might be best to tread carefully.

240
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:37,678
I'll continue my pursuit for knowledge tomorrow

241
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:39,762
and retreat for the time being.

242
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,637
It's hiding in plain sight!

243
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,762
I've discovered this house completely by chance. Finally!

244
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:49,470
My first stroke of luck since I started this mission!

245
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:51,553
No, this more than mere luck!

246
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,303
This is more like, um, what's the word...

247
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:56,428
It's like, uh... I can't think of it!

248
00:12:56,512 --> 00:12:58,428
I'm too caught up in the thrill of the moment!

249
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,178
To think, the genius who built her

250
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,720
could be in that very building!

251
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:04,970
Nano's blueprints could be mine to study her every detail!

252
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:06,178
For science!

253
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:07,803
What is this strange pounding in my chest?

254
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,137
It's like a hootenanny!

255
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,553
Like former professional wrestler cowboy Bill Watts

256
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:13,428
is beating on my heart himself!

257
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:15,553
If this is indeed the house of her creator,

258
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:18,053
then there's no telling what sort of traps there may be.

259
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,803
If I am to infiltrate this place,

260
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,303
I must be extremely cautious

261
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:22,595
and pay close attention to my surroundings.

262
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:23,595
Can I help you, lady?

263
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,053
I'm compromised!

264
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:26,919
Oh, no!

265
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:29,371
I've been spotted by the home's surveillance robot!

266
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,345
The build quality looks lower than Nano's,

267
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:33,887
but he's likely made with the same advanced technology.

268
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,178
If it determines that I'm a threat,

269
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:36,887
he'll undoubtedly dispose of me!

270
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,845
I have no choice!

271
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:39,970
I must show that I mean no harm!

272
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,470
What are you doing on the ground?

273
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:43,220
Compromised again!

274
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:45,762
So, I heard that goat of yours

275
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:48,970
carried an injured old lady to the hospital last week.

276
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:50,345
Yes, he did.

277
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,178
Then the reason you bring a goat is because it's

278
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:55,470
a service animal for emergency situations like that?

279
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:57,928
Silly.

280
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,762
Yeah. Well, I'm not the one who rides a goat.

281
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:10,595
Here you are.

282
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,053
I can't believe they got the jump on me.

283
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,220
I was trying to infiltrate the Shinonome home,

284
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:20,262
but a warm, hospitable welcome was not what I had in mind.

285
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:22,262
However, I can see through this ruse.

286
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:23,553
I'm on to their tricks.

287
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:24,928
For example, this tea.

288
00:14:25,012 --> 00:14:26,553
I'm certain it contains some sort of drug

289
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:28,595
that will erase my memory the moment I drink it.

290
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:31,887
And this room may seem ordinary,
but I'm sure I'm being watched.

291
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,095
What is that?

292
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:36,428
It has a terrifyingly concerning aura.

293
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:37,928
Such random placement.

294
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:40,387
And those painted-on sunglasses can't fool me!

295
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,303
I can't see its eyes, but I can certainly feel their gaze!

296
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:47,303
I can't make a single wrong move. It's all-seeing!

297
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,762
What's wrong, Ms. Nakamura?

298
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,637
Absolutely nothing!

299
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,137
My apologies!

300
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,345
I drank it all.

301
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,512
I'm a fool.

302
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,637
But if this does wipe my memory,

303
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,387
then I might as well make a stand!

304
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,012
I'll be completely honest with you.

305
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:05,803
Huh? Sure, go ahead.

306
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:07,345
I came to your home today

307
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,553
to find out everything I can about you!

308
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:10,637
Huh?

309
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,595
Wha?

310
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,720
I want to see what you're really like underneath it all!

311
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:17,053
So, please!

312
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:18,720
Uh, well, I mean, you're free to like what you like

313
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:20,012
and pursue what you please, but, uh--

314
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,512
I appreciate it, but I just don't think

315
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:23,553
any romantic involvement between the two of us

316
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,970
would be the most appropriate thing right now!

317
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,928
You idiot! You misunderstand my words!

318
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,428
You can't just say things like that to me

319
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:32,762
out of nowhere, you know!

320
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,887
Ah, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to!

321
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,053
When I said that I wanted to see
what you're like underneath--

322
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,303
Nano?

323
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,053
--Hakase! --Huh?

324
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:40,970
A child?

325
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:42,470
It couldn't be her child.

326
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:43,345
Of course not.

327
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:44,887
She's a robot after all!

328
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,762
But that garb.

329
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,262
It's that of an intellectual.

330
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:48,803
Could she be Nano's creator?

331
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:50,803
So, this child is not the child at all,

332
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:53,178
but maybe Nano is the child? Yes?

333
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,678
There's no way someone so young could create Nano.

334
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:57,512
Hello, you can call me Hakase.

335
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:58,970
Oh, and I created Nano.

336
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:00,512
Shoulder block!

337
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:01,345
Hakase!

338
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,303
So it's true.

339
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:05,178
This child is Nano's creator.

340
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:06,470
Hey!

341
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:08,345
Could you get me out of this thing?

342
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:10,387
I'm tired of all of your pranks!

343
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:15,762
A homunculus!

344
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:18,095
The surveillance robot, and the daruma weapon,

345
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,970
and the child creator, and Nano
Shinonome, and the homunculus!

346
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:23,553
I admit that I was a fool to think that

347
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:26,678
I was even remotely prepared to
try and infiltrate this home.

348
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:29,470
But I never could have seen any of this coming!

349
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,970
I must find a chance to strategically retreat

350
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:33,887
and reformulate my plans.

351
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,720
But...

352
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:38,470
Knowing that thing is watching has me paralyzed in fear.

353
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:40,887
I couldn't make an attempt to leave even if I tried!

354
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,303
If I suddenly state out of
nowhere that I have to go home--

355
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:48,803
I have no other options.

356
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,137
Where's the bathroom?

357
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,262
I must pee.

358
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,470
Uh, okay.

359
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:54,470
I'll show you where to go--

360
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:55,720
No need!

361
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:57,637
If you can give me the directions,

362
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,512
I can find it on my own.

363
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,470
I've completely outwitted you again,

364
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:05,928
Nano Shinonome.

365
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,637
My plan worked perfectly.

366
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,012
Because of course it did.

367
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,345
I knew how you'd respond.

368
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,803
You see, I capitalized on your weakness.

369
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:14,220
That's right.

370
00:17:14,303 --> 00:17:16,512
Your kindness leaves you gullible and far too trusting!

371
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:17,970
And when I return to this deathtrap

372
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:19,178
you call your humble abode,

373
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:21,220
I shall turn the tables on you yet.

374
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:22,428
Just you wait.

375
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:24,262
As long as I have this big brain of mine,

376
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:26,137
you'll be completely at my mercy!

377
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,637
Eventually!

378
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,178
Oh. Are you leaving?

379
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:31,387
Crap!

380
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,335
Uh, well, you see,

381
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,922
I was just asked to mow the
grass on the lawn outside and--

382
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:39,345
What the--?

383
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:40,595
Hang on! Don't move!

384
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:41,512
I'll get help!

385
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,220
No! Wait! Don't go!

386
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:45,053
Oh, no! They're onto me!

387
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:46,470
They're going to see me out here

388
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:48,678
and realize that I lied to them and tried to escape!

389
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:50,178
Dammit, what is this stuff?

390
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:54,053
It's robbing me of my movement, my freedom!

391
00:17:54,137 --> 00:17:55,262
She's over here!

392
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:57,762
Huh? But the bathroom's the other direction.

393
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,553
What is this thing?

394
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:01,803
Right! Hakase!

395
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:04,928
Your special glue comes off with water, doesn't it?

396
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:07,428
If they capture me here, then I'll be done for!

397
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:09,887
But my studies! My science!

398
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:12,082
Oh, no!

399
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:14,845
I must find a way to get out of this literal mess!

400
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:19,428
Curse you, clever bastards of the Shinonome Lab!

401
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:20,262
Water!

402
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:21,887
Somebody help.

403
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,345
Anybody!

404
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:27,845
Get me out of here!

405
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:55,178
Oh, I actually have that one.

406
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:57,928
Really? Do you think I could borrow it?

407
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,428
Yeah, sure. I can bring it tomorrow.

408
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:03,512
"Who knows what'll happen" and "that's baseball"?

409
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:05,803
Is that all she said?

410
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:07,428
Yeah. And she was acting all happy

411
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,012
and laughing and stuff.

412
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:10,803
Maybe she was trying to be strong

413
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:12,178
and laugh through the pain.

414
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:14,303
Getting indirectly rejected by the guy you like

415
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,012
isn't something you just "get over."

416
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,387
Well, she doesn't not look like she's not unhappy.

417
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,553
Wait, run that by me again?

418
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:23,220
Yuuko, you forgot your homework again, didn't you?

419
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:24,803
No! Don't be ridiculous!

420
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,303
But wait, I actually did forget, so yeah.

421
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:30,095
Make up your mind!

422
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:32,303
You'll find out after the commercial!

423
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:33,303
Huh?

424
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:35,512
Wow! That was so random and funny!

425
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:37,553
Don't you think so?

426
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:39,553
Fleming?

427
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,428
Wait, rap?

428
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,595
Oh, and Mio.

429
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:43,428
There's something else I gotta ask you.

430
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:44,928
Okay.

431
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:47,803
What's up?

432
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,387
Hey, Yuuko. You know her the best, right?

433
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,595
Can you think of anything that might help cheer her up?

434
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:03,053
I wonder where they all went.

435
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:05,595
And here I was hoping we could go out and grab some food

436
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:07,762
after we were done with class.

437
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:11,095
What are you guys doing?

438
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,303
Congratulations, young lady!

439
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:14,720
Please take a spin!

440
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,803
I know it's Yuuko. Cut the act.

441
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:17,970
Yuu-who?

442
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:19,095
Never heard of her!

443
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,595
You're so obvious.

444
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,220
I see Nano's key poking out.

445
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:25,220
It's not like this is a robotic key or anything!

446
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:27,470
Uh, anyways, everyone who passes through here

447
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,012
has to take a crack at the lottery!

448
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,387
So, step right up!

449
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,595
But why?

450
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:33,928
I don't really know what you guys are doing.

451
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:35,595
Well whatever.

452
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:41,595
Congratulations, we have a winner!

453
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:43,387
How? I don't get it.

454
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,345
And here's your special prize!

455
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:46,720
What makes it special?

456
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,345
Just open it and find out!

457
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:50,012
'Kay?

458
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:51,303
Your weird practical jokes are

459
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:53,095
getting harder and harder to understand,

460
00:20:53,178 --> 00:20:55,887
you know that, Yuuko? Uh--

461
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,303
Wonderful! Now please move along!

462
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:06,512
Thank you for coming!

463
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,178
Bonus prize.

464
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:14,012
Freshly carved.

465
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:15,678
Oh, thanks a lot.

466
00:21:33,387 --> 00:21:34,678
This reminds me.

467
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:37,178
There was something that Koujirou said a while back.

468
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,553
What was it?

469
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:43,053
Something about our ordinary lives passing us by.

470
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:46,970
And how it may actually be a series of wonderful miracles.

471
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:51,095
I think... no, I know... all of that is true.

472
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:11,595
All right!

473
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:14,345
I'm gonna go home and draw some manga!

474
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:05,970
How'd this happen?

475
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:08,678
It's all your fault we got lost out here!

476
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:11,803
Apologies. I'll find directions on my "mobile."

477
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:13,387
Why are you saying that all weird?

478
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,012
Just talk like a normal person!

479
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:18,887
Wait! Hey!

480
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,595
Are you watching TV on there?

481
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:22,262
Perhaps you should consume media content

482
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:23,595
on your "mobile" as well.

483
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:26,887
My phone isn't that fancy!

484
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:33,553
I'm Nano's key!

485
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:35,095
Sometimes I spin!

486
00:24:35,178 --> 00:24:36,428
And sometimes I don't.

487
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:38,470
Sometimes I even get pulled out!

488
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:40,512
That's my ordinary life!

489
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:44,178
And the next <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is the last one!

490
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:46,012
Look forward to it!
