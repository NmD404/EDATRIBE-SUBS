1
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:00,675
Such a beautiful morning!

2
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:08,009
Guess I should go wake Hakase up.

3
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:18,134
Maybe after breakfast,

4
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:20,467
I could take a quick stroll around the block.

5
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:22,759
Hm?

6
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:26,509
Huh? Wait! Ahh!

7
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:09,800
Wait for me, you guys! <i>Selamat pagi</i> !

8
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:11,550
Oh, hey, good morning, Yuuko.

9
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:12,925
Good morning.

10
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,550
Great day for a walk, huh?

11
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:17,217
Yeah! Even though the forecast said it would rain.

12
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,967
I thought weather people were usually right. But maybe,

13
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,925
they use a numpad to pad their numbers! Ya get it?

14
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:27,217
Ah! What's wrong with them?

15
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,050
They're totally deadpan!

16
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:31,050
It's like they didn't even hear me!

17
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,634
Am I invisible? Am I a ghost?

18
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,425
Wait a sec. What if my joke was too complicated

19
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,592
for them and they didn't understand it?

20
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:43,925
Oh well, that's a shame. It was such a good one.

21
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,717
But maybe I should try something that's more their speed.

22
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,842
Not everyone can keep up with my quick wit. Okay!

23
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:53,425
Man, it's gettin' kinda hot!

24
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:57,800
The clouds are patchy, but I hope my hair isn't!

25
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:59,509
That'd be bad.

26
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,175
Okay! Now they're really starting to freak me out!

27
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,300
I'm so spooked!

28
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,759
But I get it.

29
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:12,050
Sudden and irregular hair loss is no laughing matter.

30
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:15,050
--I gotta keep it light. --Come back!

31
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,175
All right!

32
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,675
It's time to unleash my secret weapon!

33
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,009
You better brace yourselves!

34
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,300
Hey, listen!

35
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:28,259
What do you call a thousand-leg insect that asks for help?

36
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:31,509
You call it... a centiplead!

37
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:33,175
Get it?

38
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:36,717
Still nothing? How is that possible?

39
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,509
They've got the most intense poker-faces

40
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:40,925
I've ever seen in my life!

41
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:43,759
Hold up! What if they just didn't get it

42
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:46,550
'cause they didn't know I was telling jokes?

43
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:47,884
That's fine then.

44
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,884
It's nobody's fault! Well, at least not mine. 'Kay!

45
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:53,050
Hey! It's joke time!

46
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:56,384
What do you call a thousand-leg insect that asks for help?

47
00:04:56,467 --> 00:05:00,092
You call it... a centiplead! Get it now?

48
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,925
That's the coldest shoulder I've ever seen.

49
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,300
I never thought that they could
be total ice queens like this.

50
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:11,884
But what if...

51
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:15,598
Maybe...

52
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:19,384
This is their way of saying that
I need to get up to their level.

53
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:24,884
You know what? I will!

54
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:26,217
Watch me.

55
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:30,467
Fine then! I accept your challenge!

56
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,259
I'll show you what I can do, just you wait!

57
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:35,467
You'll see! You'll all see!

58
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,634
All two of you!

59
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:44,550
I can do this! I'll never...

60
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:47,592
...give up!

61
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:51,217
So Oxygen went on a date with Potassium!

62
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,509
It went OK!

63
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:19,967
A fake noodle's an im-pasta!

64
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,884
A fat psychic's a four-chin teller.

65
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:29,550
Ahh... I tried to catch the fog.

66
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:33,675
But I mist!

67
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:46,509
So basically, you can just substitute the X

68
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:49,342
in the equation, then plug and chug the answer.

69
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:51,675
Then this Y over here...

70
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:12,259
President.

71
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:13,675
Ogi!

72
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,592
It's been forever since you've showed up to the club!

73
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:18,009
And I was starting to think you abandoned me!

74
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:19,384
How've ya been? Good?

75
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:20,634
Uh. Yeah.

76
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:23,009
Well I'm really glad you came back here, so hey!

77
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:25,467
Tell ya what! Let's celebrate your return!

78
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,217
Come on. How 'bout some Isei-no-sei?

79
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,092
Nah, I'm just here to quit.

80
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:56,925
Why do I always get the urge

81
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,509
to clear my throat just before a movie is about to start?

82
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,592
And then, I was all like--

83
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:13,509
Weboshii! Fe!

84
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:14,842
Have you seen Sasahara?

85
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:15,967
The goat guy?

86
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,050
Oh! I think I actually saw him

87
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:19,717
heading up the stairs, to the roof.

88
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,175
'Kay, thanks!

89
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,425
Looks like somebody's in a hurry. She's so smitten.

90
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,634
We should totes go and follow her!

91
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:31,300
Those two might be up to something spicy!

92
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:38,092
Oh!

93
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
In the deep blue sky, clouds drift and linger above.

94
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:44,300
It was a right hand.

95
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:45,217
Sasahara.

96
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,842
What a masterpiece!

97
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:49,675
Hey, you dork!

98
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,175
Do you have any freakin' idea what you've done?

99
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:55,925
Huh? Today's weather appeared to be quite pleasant,

100
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,092
so I came to the roof to write a poem about it.

101
00:08:58,175 --> 00:08:59,509
I'm talking about this!

102
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:01,092
That's right. Look here.

103
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:02,384
This thing ring any bells?

104
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,342
Huh. I do believe that's one of mine.

105
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:08,342
I must wonder why it's in your possession.

106
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,925
Don't act like you're innocent!

107
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,092
You were littering, so I had to pick it up for you!

108
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,884
It's certainly not trash.

109
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,175
And I never meant to throw it away.

110
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,675
I just dropped my handkerchief by acci--

111
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:23,967
Yeah right! That thing is yours, which means it's garbage!

112
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,717
If I dropped it, how did you know it was mine?

113
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,842
We don't even walk the same way to school.

114
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,384
Huh, looks like you ironed it for me, too.

115
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:45,550
Don't go assuming things! You're so stupid!

116
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:48,967
I was just wandering around lost in
thought, and I happened to

117
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,842
find it on a street somewhere near your house.

118
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,050
Hm.

119
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:01,259
I appreciate what you did, Miss Tachibana.

120
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,217
Uhh...

121
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,967
You drop a lot of things in the morning,

122
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,634
all the time.

123
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:18,009
I suppose I've never realized that. Good to know.

124
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:19,342
Well, cut it out!

125
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:22,050
You'll cause problems for the city if you don't!

126
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,425
But, uh, if you keep dropping stuff,

127
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,634
I guess I can pick up after you.

128
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:32,509
Hm?

129
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,675
But don't get the wrong idea!

130
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:41,259
I'm only doing what's necessary to keep the streets clean!

131
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,759
Dang, that Misato never changes, does she?

132
00:10:56,842 --> 00:11:00,675
Hey um. What do I do with this?

133
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,759
Uh! Why'd you grab that thing?!

134
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:04,384
I didn't know what to do with it!

135
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:05,592
Just leave it somewhere!

136
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:06,717
But then what do I do?

137
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
Just leave it and walk away!

138
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,259
But then what do I do after that?

139
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:11,592
Keep on walking!

140
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,509
Things we think are freakin' cool!

141
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,300
Super-car bicycle!

142
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:47,050
I give up. It's all over.

143
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:49,175
Help isn't coming.

144
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:13,259
There is no God.

145
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:15,300
There is no Buddha.

146
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,342
Yesterday...

147
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:36,300
...was pork cutlet bowls?

148
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:47,175
Oh, well. This is fine.

149
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:10,509
Huh?

150
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:19,842
How long has it been?

151
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:34,592
Oh, whoops. I think I...

152
00:13:34,675 --> 00:13:36,634
...dozed off there.

153
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:47,092
Yeah. It's fine.

154
00:13:57,925 --> 00:14:00,050
The word-chain game.

155
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:01,509
Wanna play?

156
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:07,800
Mandarin.

157
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,884
Oh. Sorry.

158
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,634
Say that again?

159
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,884
What would that be?

160
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,800
Be.

161
00:14:34,884 --> 00:14:36,217
Be...

162
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,509
Be.

163
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:55,759
Uh, can I just say any random word?

164
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:57,300
Eggplant.

165
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:18,134
Heh... Heh. Heh.

166
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:40,217
Eggplant!

167
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:43,259
She's dead!

168
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:48,009
Help isn't coming!

169
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,425
Isn't coming!

170
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:57,009
Guess I'll die.

171
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,675
It looks like the club is down to just you and me again.

172
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,134
We'll have to disband if we can't find a third member

173
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:18,217
to join us sometime soon. If only we could make the club

174
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,967
more appealing to recruit more members.

175
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,342
--Question. --Huh?

176
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:24,842
What do we even do in this club?

177
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:25,702
Oh, right!

178
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:31,009
That's what we have to figure
out to make us more appealing!

179
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:33,259
We kinda don't do anything.

180
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,050
On your mark...

181
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:39,967
Get set...

182
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:41,425
Go!

183
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,759
Helvetica Standard.

184
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,384
Hey! Cut it out, dude!

185
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:53,092
Let go of my jersey!

186
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:55,175
Come on, bro, just relax!

187
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:56,509
Lemme take it off for you!

188
00:16:56,592 --> 00:16:58,009
I can't do that, dude!

189
00:16:58,092 --> 00:17:01,134
I didn't score at all today! Not a single point!

190
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:03,467
It's fine, bro! It's not like you'll need this

191
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,509
old uniform after you retire anyway!

192
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,009
Just hear me out, dude!

193
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,717
My uniform won't be worth anything

194
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,425
if I'm a player that's never scored!

195
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:11,884
That's not true, bro!

196
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:15,175
You inspired me to play ball and that's worth it to me!

197
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:17,675
All right, dude, all right, fine, I'll do it!

198
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,675
I can take if off myself!

199
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,717
Just like, uh, let me go so I can do it!

200
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Uhh...

201
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:28,717
All right, ya got me.

202
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,050
Psych!

203
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,509
Hey uh, sorry, bro.

204
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:49,032
Listen up!

205
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:52,467
I'm gonna remind you again that
you need to respect your elders.

206
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,050
'Kay...

207
00:17:57,384 --> 00:18:00,967
As always, she can be such a pawful.

208
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,134
Hm? Oh!

209
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:26,175
Oh, man, this is too fun!

210
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:27,759
C'mere tail!

211
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:38,550
At first, I wanted to make a sport that captured

212
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,675
the best parts of Go and Soccer.

213
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,800
So... That's why I made a club for it.

214
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,675
But...

215
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,509
I got nothin'.

216
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,425
Draw a boomerang shape.

217
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,384
Then a triangle shape, then a rectangle shape.

218
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:01,592
Hakase! It's time to go to bed!

219
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,009
'Kay!

220
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,884
You weren't just eating snacks were you?

221
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,509
I didn't eat any snacks.

222
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:11,259
Why are you looking to the side?

223
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:13,467
I'll look the other way to even it out.

224
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,050
That doesn't make sense.

225
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:16,259
Ah-ha! See!

226
00:19:16,342 --> 00:19:18,967
Why are you snacking after I told you not to?

227
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,342
I, uh, wasn't the one who ate those snacks!

228
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:23,550
If you didn't eat them,

229
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:25,384
why do you have crumbs all over your face?

230
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:32,384
I think I've caught a cold.

231
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,175
Enough! I'm not playing around!

232
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:36,592
When I say no, it means no! And you're not listening!

233
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,675
Not one bit!

234
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,009
It's not my fault!

235
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:41,717
Sakamoto forced me to eat all of the yummy snacks!

236
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,175
He's got a little snot bubble. That's gross.

237
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,217
Don't try to change the subject!

238
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:04,134
Jeez. You need remember to brush your teeth before bed.

239
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:05,967
I already brushed 'em!

240
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,759
Huh? Did you brush them again after you had snacks?

241
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,967
I did. Extra good.

242
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,467
What are you so embarrassed about?

243
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,675
It's fine!

244
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,634
Brushing once a night is all I need to do!

245
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,384
No, it's not! You brush after you eat.

246
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,717
Well, did you brush after my snack?!

247
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,634
I don't have to. I didn't eat!

248
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:27,759
Uh! Then, uh...

249
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:29,967
I'm all ready to go to bed, and you're not.

250
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,967
Now go brush before you get cavities.

251
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,425
You're a robot, so you can't even get cavities!

252
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:42,842
Ah! Wait, uh!

253
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:49,092
I mean, um, that I just, uh.
Maybe you can get a tiny cavity.

254
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:50,425
Can I really?

255
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:51,300
Uh, yeah sure.

256
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,300
Uhh! You're lying.

257
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:54,300
Oh! But you can still

258
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,634
get other grody stuff, like rust!

259
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:59,384
--I'll rust. --Okay, uh!

260
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,175
I'll add a feature that lets you get cavities!

261
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,050
I promise! It'll be the best feature ever!

262
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,550
Do you really swear?

263
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:14,384
You can count on me!

264
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,717
Come on, Nano!

265
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,550
Let's go and brush our teeth again!

266
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:24,342
Okay. But you know I don't have to, right?

267
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:26,134
Whoa! It's already ten o'clock!

268
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:27,050
It sure is.

269
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:28,300
Today was a blast!

270
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:29,717
Yeah, yeah.

271
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,925
I had so much fun!

272
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:11,800
Man.

273
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:15,925
I wish Sasahara would just take things seriously for once.

274
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:29,259
We're a double-yolk egg! Like twins!

275
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:30,425
Twinning!

276
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,384
Ow! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

277
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:33,842
Hot! It's hot!

278
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:37,342
Th-The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 9!

279
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:40,009
Ouch! Look forward to-- Ah, ah, hot!
