1
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:10,891
Green light...

2
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:12,308
And red light.

3
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:42,725
This is bad! Really, really bad!

4
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:45,016
Homeroom's starting and I'm so freakin' late!

5
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,183
Gotta come up with a really good excuse!

6
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,058
I can't say I stopped to help an old lady,

7
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:50,725
or that my mom didn't wake me up on time--

8
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:51,933
I used those already!

9
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:53,141
What's believable?

10
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:55,391
And what'll for sure get me out of trouble?

11
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,891
What was even the point of the red light?!

12
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,558
How did I hit every single stop light

13
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:06,975
on the way over?

14
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:08,808
Thanks to that, I have to awkwardly show up

15
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,516
in the middle of first period!

16
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:18,975
What's with the booby trap?

17
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:21,975
As if I'd fall for such a basic prank.

18
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:24,725
Ah! A two-fer?

19
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:27,141
What kind of cruel and unusual punishment is this?

20
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:30,683
I didn't even do anything wrong! Besides being late.

21
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,183
It's a good thing I can just slip in

22
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,683
through the little side door here.

23
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,058
At least that saves me the embarrassment

24
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,725
of getting chewed out at the front of the classroom.

25
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,891
Yup. Of course it's locked.

26
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,391
It just had to be locked today of all days!

27
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:51,266
I know! I can just sneak through the bottom door thingy!

28
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,933
I'll just slip in like the wind, completely undetected,

29
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,308
and they'll be none the wiser.

30
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,266
What is going on?

31
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,641
I should've known!

32
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:02,683
There's only one mastermind in this entire school

33
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:04,850
who'd do this and she's in my class.

34
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,641
I guess it could be for the best.

35
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:07,808
If I crawled through there,

36
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:09,475
I'd probably get into even more trouble.

37
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:10,766
But if I'm gonna go down,

38
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,725
I might as well take the high road!

39
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:38,308
Since when do we have stained-glass windows?

40
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,100
Hang on, why am I running?

41
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:41,683
There's nothing to run away from.

42
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:44,558
I've got no choice but to go back and face the music.

43
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:46,850
It's the right thing to do.

44
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,641
Looks like there's only one way this can go

45
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:51,350
that works out for me.

46
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:54,975
If I am to perish, I shall accept my fate proudly.

47
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:58,308
I'll march in through the front
door and go out with a bang.

48
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,975
That would be awesome!

49
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,850
Now, it's show time!

50
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,683
Prepare yourself, eraser.

51
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:05,100
You're gonna smack this class clown

52
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:08,141
with a giant grin on her face!

53
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,433
Sorry I'm late, but I <i>erased</i> to get here!

54
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,308
Everyone will think I'm hilarious!

55
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:17,475
Do you have any idea what time it is, young lady?

56
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,641
But I just can't stay mad at you.

57
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:23,183
Go ahead and take your seat, ya rascal!

58
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:26,100
I got this! I totally got this!

59
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:28,058
I am beauty. I am grace.

60
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:29,808
I shall appear...

61
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:33,016
...with a smile on my face!

62
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,641
Good morning, my fellow classmates!

63
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,725
I'm here and ready to start the tardy party!

64
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:24,475
I'm an invincible alien!

65
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:29,808
What stupid crap are you up to this time?

66
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,391
Aren't you a little old to be messing around like this?

67
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,558
People from planet Invincible are safe

68
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,766
from every sort of attack!

69
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:41,683
Hey! Uh. Heads up! I guess!

70
00:06:58,766 --> 00:06:59,891
Would you shut up?!

71
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:01,725
Miles Davis is rolling in his grave!

72
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:02,752
I'm so sorry!

73
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,808
I guess we got a little bit carried away there, huh?

74
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,600
So what'd you think of our sound, cool cat?

75
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:07,600
It was pure torture!

76
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:08,933
And the only "sound" I could hear

77
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,641
was the rupturing of my ear drums!

78
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:13,016
Maybe you'll change your mind if I play it again.

79
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,558
Did you hear a word I said?!

80
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:21,641
Heh?

81
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,016
Looks like there's gonna be flowing noodles

82
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
at the park by the shrine today.

83
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:50,058
Guess I'll check it out!

84
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:52,350
I've only ever seen it done on TV,

85
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:56,350
but I bet it'll be super neat
to do it myself in real life!

86
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,183
Gotta try and get a good spot at the front,

87
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:01,475
or I might miss out on the noodly goodness!

88
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:03,225
I haven't eaten at all today,

89
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:07,308
so I gotta make sure to snag a
buncha noods and eat my fill!

90
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:17,058
Uh...

91
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:20,891
Noodles!

92
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:27,683
What the hell are you doing?!

93
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,475
Are you trying to screw things up?!

94
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,391
Here comes some more.

95
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:36,308
Um, excuse me, but I don't, uh...

96
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,600
What?!

97
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,683
Are you gonna show up here, waste my noodles,

98
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:40,183
and just give up?

99
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,766
I don't know who you think you are,

100
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,558
but that ain't gonna fly with me!

101
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:46,183
Uhh...

102
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:47,558
So, don't be mad,

103
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:50,308
but, uh, I don't have any chopsticks with me.

104
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:53,058
You're quite the demanding brat, huh?!

105
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,891
Here, you better be ready now!

106
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,475
Okay.

107
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:00,016
Eww...

108
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,558
Sorry to bother you,

109
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,516
but I think these are kinda-sorta used already.

110
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,433
Deal with it.

111
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:10,600
Enough chatter! My noodles wait for no one, get it?

112
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,850
Oh, well, guess I have no choice.

113
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,600
Aww.

114
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,683
When I dish out a joke, you're supposed to laugh.

115
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:35,100
The next one coming up will be different,

116
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,766
and I'll show you what true hell is like!

117
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,891
So get ready!

118
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:44,975
Uhh...

119
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:46,933
I'm not gonna waste all my water on you!

120
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:49,516
It's dry noodle or no noodle!

121
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,933
Don't you even think about skipping them.

122
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,683
I, uh...

123
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:05,683
Would you quit being so flaky?

124
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:09,100
Dig in and savor the flavor of raw noodles!

125
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:11,266
Uhh...

126
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,391
What are you waiting for?!

127
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,433
They won't stay fresh all day, y'know!

128
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:18,266
You haven't changed one bit.

129
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:26,933
Uh?

130
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:32,225
Y-You came back.

131
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:33,891
Uh...?

132
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:38,850
Masaharu!

133
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:42,391
When I caught word of the flowing noodles in the park,

134
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,475
I knew it had to be you.

135
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:46,558
I only did it all this time because I knew

136
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:49,558
that you would come back to me someday.

137
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:52,850
It's been 30 years since you left to search

138
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,141
for the most delicious flowing noodles.

139
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:56,725
Were you able to find them?

140
00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:58,600
Huh?

141
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:01,183
I sampled noodles from all across the land,

142
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:03,516
but I'm afraid that it was all for naught.

143
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:07,308
I used our savings to support my travels,

144
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,641
but I must report, they're as dry as an uncooked nood.

145
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:12,933
Eh?

146
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:14,475
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:17,516
Could you ever accept a broken man without his noodles?

148
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,725
Huh?!

149
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,350
Of course.

150
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,641
What are you lookin' at?! Keep on walking!

151
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:28,101
Excuse me, miss,

152
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:30,641
but could you make like a flowing noodle and slip away?

153
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:33,558
Huh?!

154
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:43,475
Listen up, freshman, it's announcement time!

155
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:45,433
There are some people who learn with praise

156
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:47,516
and others who learn through criticism.

157
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,350
And I will be the one to determine which type you are,

158
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,391
you understand me?

159
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:53,766
When you learn through praise,

160
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,350
but never get praised.

161
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,850
Eight. Seven. Six. Five.

162
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:15,266
Four. Three. Two. One. Zero.

163
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,600
Launch when I say it like that!

164
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,808
Wait, what?

165
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:31,266
Seriously?! Why?!

166
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:35,766
Nano!

167
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,350
Look at what I did! I put my hair in a ponytail!

168
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,475
Oh...

169
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:41,891
What do you think?

170
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:43,600
It makes you look a lot more mature

171
00:12:43,683 --> 00:12:45,350
when you put your hair up like that.

172
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:50,516
Uh! Really?

173
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,225
Okay, so can you tell me more about

174
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:54,266
how grown up you think I've gotten?

175
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,641
Yeah, okay.

176
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:58,266
I guess you seem more mature than you used to be?

177
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,433
How about you?

178
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:02,308
How grown up do you think you are, Nano?

179
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:03,516
Huh?

180
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,183
Well, I suppose I've never thought of myself

181
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,350
as the particularly mature type.

182
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:09,475
Yeah, you're right.

183
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:11,350
I guess you aren't all that mature, huh?

184
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:14,850
So, it looks like I have to be the one who cleans up!

185
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:20,600
Pick up this, and this.

186
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,600
Here, I'll grab that for you!

187
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:28,975
Um, I was still reading that. You don't have to take it.

188
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,600
Oh, silly Nano. Uh.

189
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,225
Uhh...

190
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:38,558
What am I gonna do with you, Sakamoto? Huh?

191
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:40,016
Uh, what're you doing?

192
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,975
I don't want you to catch a cold.

193
00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:43,225
I dunno what you're up to,

194
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:44,433
but leave me out of it.

195
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,808
Oh, silly Sakamoto.

196
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:48,016
What?

197
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,058
You'll catch a cold.

198
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:49,886
No, I won't!

199
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:52,225
And if you're gonna cover me, use a towel or a blanket,

200
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:53,641
not a stupid book!

201
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:57,475
Oh, Sakamoto. Always so quick to complain.

202
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:58,766
Cut it out!

203
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,933
I do not appreciate this harassment!

204
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:04,141
All right, I'm gonna go and put the laundry in.

205
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,641
Hey! Good idea! Let's do it!

206
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,058
I've got this covered, Hakase.

207
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,391
All that's left to do now is turn on the dial.

208
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:15,600
Then it looks like I have no choice.

209
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:17,391
I'll turn the dial for you!

210
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:21,183
No. Don't worry. I can handle this part by myself.

211
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,433
I said I can turn it,

212
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:24,516
so lemme turn the dial thing, 'cause I wanna!

213
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,766
Okay, sure.

214
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,558
Could you please help me with the laundry?

215
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:45,516
If you need my help, you just have to ask.

216
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,558
Right. Sounds good.

217
00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:59,183
Oh, well.

218
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,183
It looks like you're having trouble with the cooking,

219
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:20,891
so let me take care of it.

220
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:24,641
Actually, I think things are going fine on my end.

221
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:27,475
I bet my cooking will taste better if you try it!

222
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,183
Come on, I'll prove it to you!

223
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:30,433
Cut it out! That's dangerous!

224
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:31,725
Just lemme use the thingy!

225
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,100
I'm serious! You need to be careful!

226
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,391
--Come on! --Let go!

227
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:36,850
--You can trust me-- --Or else its gonna--

228
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:47,350
Oh my goodness! Is everything okay, Sakamoto?

229
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,100
Do things look okay to you?!

230
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:50,808
No! But I was just hoping!

231
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:52,433
You are so reckless, Sakamoto,

232
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,475
walking straight into harm's way like that.

233
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:55,766
How is this my fault?!

234
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,350
You were the ones messing around!

235
00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:00,641
Try to relax, kitty-kitty. Being mad isn't helping anyone.

236
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:02,725
You are making zero sense right now!

237
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:05,558
It's not a big deal. I'll just start over.

238
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:07,933
Don't worry! You can leave all the cooking to me!

239
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:10,725
Well, I don't want all the other food to get cold,

240
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:12,183
so it needs to be quick.

241
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,683
Yeah, I get it.

242
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:16,266
I'll have to take care of things then.

243
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,641
Watch the eggs, Hakase!

244
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,391
You're gonna knock 'em over like that!

245
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:21,433
Don't worry so much! I'm grown up!

246
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:22,558
Hey! Careful!

247
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:24,600
I have everything under control!

248
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:27,725
Oh, clumsy kitty.

249
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,516
It's your fault!

250
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,933
Ugh. What is her deal today, anyway?

251
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:36,975
I think she's trying to act mature for us.

252
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:39,141
Because I am mature.

253
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:40,433
Psh.

254
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,683
Oh. Hey, kid.

255
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,433
Yeah, what's up?

256
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:49,308
You do know that mature kids don't get snacks.

257
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,350
Ta-dah! It was actually the same
ol' Hakase this entire time!

258
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:04,808
I lied.

259
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,433
Wha...?

260
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,100
Hm?

261
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:15,475
Whoa! It looks like I've got a big one!

262
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:20,933
Wow! A single rain boot!

263
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:21,808
Hm?

264
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:24,433
Ah! It's a giant one this time!

265
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,058
Whoa! It's an old tea kettle!

266
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,141
This is starting to feel more like

267
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:34,725
treasure hunting than fishing.

268
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,183
If I knew I'd find such cool stuff,

269
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:37,808
I would've brought some friends.

270
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,433
I guess I'll come back later.

271
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:58,933
Some trendy things.

272
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:12,308
Bare-handed sushi.

273
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,141
Dammit!

274
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,308
I don't wanna do my homework!

275
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:28,308
Why does homework even exist in the first place?

276
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:30,766
Well, my grades are in the crapper right now,

277
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,683
so I kinda have to do it.

278
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:35,975
I'm usually so good at doing just enough to scrape by.

279
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:37,433
Usually.

280
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,641
But right now...

281
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:41,141
...I'm wondering what I'll even do

282
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:43,641
if I graduate and go off to college.

283
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:46,391
What comes next? Getting a job?

284
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:49,725
I keep hearing about how tough the job market is nowadays,

285
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:53,016
so what chance do I have if I don't get my degree?

286
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,600
High school... College... Career...

287
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:02,975
The biggest hurdle right now
would be college entrance exams.

288
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:07,100
But... studying is the worst!

289
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:10,433
How is this school work applicable to real life anyway?

290
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,475
Wait, hang on.

291
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:16,350
What do I even want out of life?

292
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,725
"My dreams for the future" by Yuuko Aioi!

293
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:23,225
What do I want to be when I grow up?

294
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:26,725
I wanna be a frilled lizard, 'cause they're cool!

295
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:29,225
I'm... a Lizard.

296
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:32,016
La, la, la, la, la.

297
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,141
I don't wanna study!

298
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:36,808
I don't wanna be a frilled lizard anymore either,

299
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:39,850
so I'm running out of options!

300
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,600
Wait, actually.

301
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:43,141
If I was a frilled lizard,

302
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,433
I wouldn't have to deal with real people problems anymore.

303
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:49,016
But if I didn't want any problems,

304
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,766
I think I'd have a pretty easy life

305
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,308
if I was a living national treasure.

306
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:56,933
If I did become one, I wonder how much I would make...

307
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:59,058
And how do I become a living national treasure

308
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:00,391
in the first place?

309
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:03,725
Come to think of it, I'm not even sure what one is.

310
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:05,975
All right, enough crazy talk.

311
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:08,683
I need to come up with some realistic options.

312
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:11,850
What do I want to become? What do I want to do?

313
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,350
What to do...

314
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:18,183
No good. I've got nothing.

315
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,433
I just started high school,

316
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:22,058
so I guess I have a few years to think it over.

317
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:26,600
If I've still got nothing by then, that means...

318
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:31,516
College! Exams! And studying!

319
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,225
And I don't wanna study!

320
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:37,016
No, I can't think like that!

321
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,558
I just need a plan.

322
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:41,016
I have to figure out what I wanna do with my life.

323
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,433
Once I figure that out, everything will fall into place!

324
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,266
What do I wanna do?

325
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,558
What do I wanna do?

326
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:04,725
Oh, hey, Mom!

327
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:13,433
Would you stop banging on the floor?!

328
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:15,683
Don't you know how late it is?

329
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:42,808
Well, I'm not too great with tough questions.

330
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:46,183
For now, I'll just do my homework.

331
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:26,516
Dammit! I still don't wanna do my homework!

332
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,391
Heya! I'm a frilled lizard!

333
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,225
I'm pretty tough to fold as origami!

334
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:32,516
It might take a few sheets

335
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,808
before you finally figure out how to make me!

336
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:38,350
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 11!

337
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,308
You better look forward to it!
