1
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,750
Man, I'm starving.

2
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:19,375
Oh?

3
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:20,834
Well, that's subtle.

4
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,959
Don't these kids have anything better to do?

5
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:25,459
Whatever.

6
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:28,417
There's a fish in it for me, so I guess I'll get trapped.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,084
Seems pretty harmless.

8
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:35,000
I gotchu! Kitty fell for it!

9
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:37,042
Nope. Not harmless.

10
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,459
Harmful.

11
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,167
Huh?

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,959
I was gonna cook this up for lunch in a little bit.

13
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,417
Now I hafta go out and buy something else.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,750
What a bad boy.

15
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,375
Don't you blame this on me!

16
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:49,625
But why not?

17
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,417
You're the one who said you wanted to eat it.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,459
I did not! When did I ever say that?

19
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:55,792
You ate it, didn't you?

20
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,000
Can you believe how hot it is today?

21
00:00:58,084 --> 00:00:59,292
Ugh. I know, right?

22
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,084
Wanna grab some ice cream after school?

23
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,917
Oh, yeah! For sure! I could totally go for that.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,125
That sounds perfect!

25
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,917
There's a new spot I wanna try.

26
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:11,084
Hey, kid.

27
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,417
It looks like she wants to go to school.

28
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,625
You can't go!

29
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,709
Where's this coming from all of a sudden?

30
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,875
Nano, why are you leaving me?

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,209
What?

32
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:28,042
Who in the world told you I was gonna leave you?

33
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,542
Him.

34
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,417
That's not even remotely close to what I said!

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,709
So then, are you still gonna go?

36
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,750
Well, I am planning on going to the store,

37
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,042
if that's what you mean.

38
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,709
There's just a few things I need to pick up

39
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:40,167
so I can make us some lunch.

40
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,375
I want go to the store with you!

41
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,709
I'm not buying you any snacks.

42
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,625
I want the shark chocolate!

43
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,709
Not happening.

44
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,084
Come on! It's only chocolate!

45
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,709
I already told you no.

46
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,500
Just one! That's like almost nothing!

47
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:53,625
It's still something.

48
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,375
Actually, Sakamoto wants it.

49
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,375
Don't drag me into this!

50
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,917
Hey, it's Mio. Morning.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,834
Ah! What's wrong with your face?

52
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,584
You look awful!

53
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,917
Now you mention, I didn't been feel not very good.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,125
So, yeah...

55
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,459
Oh, man.

56
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,667
You can't even form a proper sentence right now.

57
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,459
And that fever looks real bad.

58
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:52,209
Why didn't you just stay at home
if you're feeling this sick?

59
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:55,792
I couldn't 'cause...

60
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,000
I told you, I gotta show you those magic tricks.

61
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:01,750
Remember? The secret ones.

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,292
What magic tricks? You never told me about them.

63
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,125
Hey! Just forget about the
tricks and go back home to rest!

64
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,917
But I spent so much time practicing my magic.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,084
I guarantee you, it'll be so worth it.

66
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:19,042
Just sit back and be prepared to be amazed.

67
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:19,709
It's gonna be--

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,625
I'm amazed you came to school.

69
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:24,792
Why don't you take it easy?

70
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,500
Yuuko!

71
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:32,750
Your prop... is already migrating out of your bag!

72
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,500
I'll just pretend I didn't see it and act surprised later.

73
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:40,750
Otherwise she would've dragged
herself out here for nothing.

74
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,084
But I don't get it.

75
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,792
Why is she trying so hard to show off her...?

76
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:49,209
Bird! It's totally out in the open now!

77
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:52,375
Her props are on the loose!

78
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,667
It flew away!

79
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:03,917
My tissues.

80
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,750
'Kay, so I'm gonna start the show now.

81
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,709
Sure. Go ahead!

82
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,625
Great, what do I do with this thing?

83
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,917
I just hid it on instinct.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,667
All right.

85
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,750
First we have... I have, uh...

86
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,459
She's really out of it.

87
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,334
She hasn't even noticed that
her dove and wand are missing.

88
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:41,292
First, I'll pass a cigarette through this ordinary coin.

89
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:46,750
This is pathetic. I can already see the hole!

90
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,959
Every card in the deck is an ace of hearts!

91
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:53,500
Now what?

92
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,459
Hang on.

93
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:08,292
Something just flew out of her mouth.

94
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,584
With her gross sneeze.

95
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:29,334
I don't understand. What were you planning?

96
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:34,375
Yuuko!

97
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,000
And she's out.

98
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,417
Rest in peace. Or whatevs.

99
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,000
'Kay, I'm heading to the supermarket now.

100
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:56,084
Great! I'm gonna go, too!

101
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,000
That's fine, but I'm not getting you anything

102
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,584
since you were misbehaving.

103
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,667
Ya hear that? Too bad for you!

104
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,917
She's not talking to me!

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,209
Come on. Let's go to the store.

106
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,084
So, what are you gonna get?

107
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,625
Well, I was thinking another fish.

108
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:14,875
I wonder what kind of snack I should buy.

109
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,959
I said I wasn't buying you anything.

110
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:20,084
Huh? But what if I wanted a not snack?

111
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:23,042
It doesn't matter, you're not getting any food.

112
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,709
Huh?

113
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,084
In that case, what's left at the grocery store

114
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,792
that I can buy? Anything?

115
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,709
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

116
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,584
Whoa! Check it out! It's a shark castella!

117
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,584
Oh, they put a food stall here?

118
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,042
That dessert looks super tasty, right?

119
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,292
Hey, don't try anything funny.

120
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,750
I've made up my mind.

121
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,417
Aww. But what if it was for Sakamoto?

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,917
Would that be okay?

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,875
Sakamoto misbehaved, too, so he's in the same boat as you.

124
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,500
Oh, did I say it was for Sakamoto?

125
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,084
I meant it was for you.

126
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,084
Nope, it's not gonna happen.

127
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,375
If I'm not firm with her,

128
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:59,584
she's just gonna end up spoiled.

129
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,167
All right, come along.

130
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,959
Let's get going now.

131
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:11,625
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

132
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,834
No! I need to stand my ground!

133
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,792
But then again...

134
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,792
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

135
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,625
I really shouldn't. Should I?

136
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,209
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

137
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:25,000
I definitely can't!

138
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,167
But what if I did?

139
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,625
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

140
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,209
No! Absolutely not! Maybe one snack?

141
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,542
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

142
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,000
Ugh! There's no way!

143
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:34,917
Unless...

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,459
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it--

145
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,292
So yummy!

146
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,709
Really? You ended up caving?

147
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,959
I'm sorry. She's persuasive.

148
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,167
This little brat can just throw a tantrum

149
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,584
and ends up getting whatever she wants.

150
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,917
Someone oughta teach her a lesson.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,250
Hey, kid, don't you have any self-control?

152
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,209
I sure do!

153
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:57,917
Don't you lie to me!

154
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,542
It's another peaceful day

155
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,084
at the Shinonome household.

156
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,917
Wow! You got a whole 80 points!

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,167
I knew you had it in ya!

158
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,167
Yeah!

159
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:27,334
Perfect. Can you tell me your secret to success?

160
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,417
There's no secret! It just kinda happened, ya know?

161
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,584
Ah. Really? Don't be like that!

162
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,625
--Eighty points! Yeah! --Can you please stop?

163
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,709
--Eighty points! Yeah! --That hurts. Hey!

164
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:40,292
Quit it!

165
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,875
Jeez.

166
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,042
Okay, okay.

167
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,875
Do you really wanna know my secret?

168
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,000
Not really. I got a 96, so it's fine.

169
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:49,834
Well then, I'll tell you.

170
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:52,667
It takes a whole lotta hard work.

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,959
And some heart.

172
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,209
Shut up.

173
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:07,417
Here's your test back.

174
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,500
Ohh...

175
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,459
Huh?

176
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:24,334
Wha--?

177
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:34,209
Oh, yeah!

178
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:46,375
Hey, Dad? I'm here to make dinner!

179
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:48,875
Mom's still out enjoying her vacation, isn't she?

180
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,584
She is. Thank you, dear.

181
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,125
Hi, Grandpa!

182
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,292
Hello there, kiddo.

183
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,542
Wonderful.

184
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,417
Playing with my grandson will help clear my mind

185
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,084
and ease the hardships of reality.

186
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,625
So then, what would you like to play today?

187
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:08,125
I wanna... I wanna see your official seal!

188
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,000
Eh?

189
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,542
Come on, where you hiding it?

190
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,334
I wanna play with it. Is it somewhere in here?

191
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,834
Am I warm?

192
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:21,250
It's somewhere on the bookshelf, right?

193
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:24,792
Somehow, this is even worse than reality.

194
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,875
Let me see the seal! Let me!

195
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:46,709
Helvetica Standard.

196
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,334
Did you forget that we were meeting up or something?

197
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,917
You're so late!

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,209
I'm really sorry!

199
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,125
I thought I took the right bus,

200
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,375
but I ended up riding the waves of life instead.

201
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,417
No prob!

202
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
We can ride them all the way to the train station!

203
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,209
Nano.

204
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:22,542
Hey, Nano. Wake up.

205
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:27,750
Is there something wrong, Hakase?

206
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:29,417
I think I gotta go potty,

207
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,250
but I'm scared to go to the bathroom alone.

208
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:34,750
Can you come to the bathroom, too?

209
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,000
Come on, can you?

210
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,750
Nano. Please? Nano?

211
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,875
Wake up. Please?

212
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:45,084
Huh?

213
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,792
Hakase, you're being so funny.

214
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,125
About what?

215
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,500
Borscht is a soup that's made out of beetroots,

216
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,625
you silly goose.

217
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,542
What? That's not it.

218
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,875
Let's go potty.

219
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,209
Hey, Nano.

220
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,084
Wake up, dummy!

221
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:13,584
Just go!

222
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,459
Wait. Did you just--?

223
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:22,417
No, it's okay. I don't have to go that bad.

224
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,875
But still, you should go to the bathroom anyway.

225
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,750
'Kay...

226
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:41,084
Nope.

227
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:42,459
Seriously?

228
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,750
Sakamoto is a considerate cat

229
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,250
and doesn't speak aloud.

230
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:50,125
Aw, man. What a pain.

231
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,125
Can't believe this kid.

232
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,584
Frozen in fear just because the night happens to be

233
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,042
a little bit dark and stormy.

234
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,959
Not surprising.

235
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:03,125
Wait a second. I can take advantage of this.

236
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,334
I'll accompany her and then she'll understand who's boss.

237
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,792
Hey, brat.

238
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,875
Since no one else will, I'll take you to the bathroom.

239
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,625
But you're tiny and really weak,

240
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,917
so that doesn't help me at all.

241
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,792
It looks like she wants to go to school.

242
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:46,709
Oh, hey. Hakase, what are you doing in my bed?

243
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:50,417
Nano, can we go potty together?

244
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,125
Well, I don't really need to go right now, so...

245
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,709
It's kinda scary outside,

246
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:58,000
so I really wanna go together.

247
00:15:58,084 --> 00:15:59,584
Oh.

248
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,334
You know, you could've just woken me up.

249
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,292
I tried, but it didn't work!

250
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,209
There's a banging sound.

251
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,292
You think someone's inside the house?

252
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,875
Pretty sure it's just the chimney blowing in the wind.

253
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,792
But it really is coming down hard out there.

254
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,000
Nano? What's the matter?

255
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,459
Hey. What's wrong?

256
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,500
Hey. Hey!

257
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,917
Hakase! I'm scared!

258
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,834
The thunder and lightning!

259
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:51,375
I'm here for you, so there's nothing to be afraid of.

260
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:54,959
Let's hurry and do our business

261
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:57,334
so we can get back to bed where it's safe.

262
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,375
Okay.

263
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,042
You know, going alone would've been really spooky.

264
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,709
But since we're together, it's not so scary after all.

265
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,667
I think so, too.

266
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:18,792
Nano, do you really wanna go to school?

267
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,000
Huh?

268
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,042
I think, uh, I'm fine staying at home.

269
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,417
But Sakamoto said you looked like you wanted to go,

270
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,834
and I wanna know if that's true!

271
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,500
Well, I suppose it is.

272
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,625
Things we think are freakin' cool!

273
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:07,459
Huh?

274
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:10,042
My 80 point score!

275
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,292
Shut up.

276
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,667
One month goes by fast,

277
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,375
but Sunday always seems so far away.

278
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,834
Next stop: 80th street.

279
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,125
That's eight zero.

280
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,542
Stand clear of the closing doors please.

281
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,875
Shut up.

282
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,500
Want me to sing you a song from the 80s?

283
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:46,084
'Cause you know that's my jam now. Heh.

284
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,209
Shut up.

285
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,542
♪ Got an 80! A what? An 80! ♪

286
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,792
♪ That's right! Got an 80! Booyah! An 80! ♪

287
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,125
Shut the hell up!

288
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,375
Can you believe it?

289
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,875
All right, let's settle down.

290
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,667
I'm announcing the average score for the test.

291
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,459
It was... 92.

292
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That means...

293
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:10,209
Don't say it! Just let it go.

294
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,625
Huh?

295
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:52,709
Hey, you brat! What's the big idea?!

296
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,209
Aww. Look at what you did now.

297
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,334
I'd appreciate it if you stopped horsing around

298
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,417
and helped me with the laundry.

299
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:04,375
Starting tomorrow, you can go to school!

300
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:05,667
Huh?

301
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,125
Are you serious?

302
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,292
Mh-hm!

303
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,667
Wait, but why?

304
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,292
What made you change your mind all of a sudden?

305
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,459
My generosity knows no bounds.

306
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,084
All right!

307
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:35,167
Now I can eat all the snacks I want for lunch

308
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,959
and not get yelled at.

309
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:46,709
But, Hakase, I can't carry a bag with this key on, so...

310
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes, you can.

311
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:49,417
Just hear me out.

312
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,709
If you take the key off of my back, then I can, uh...

313
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,917
You like your school uniform?

314
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,584
I love you, Hakase!

315
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,709
Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano!

316
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:29,542
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase!

317
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,750
Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano!

318
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,334
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase!

319
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,459
Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano!

320
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:38,917
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase!

321
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,334
--Nano! Nano! --Hakase! Hakase!

322
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,084
Nano, Nano!

323
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,167
Hakase, Hakase!

324
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:44,917
Nano!

325
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,834
Hakase!

326
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,292
Nano, Nano!

327
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,375
I'm national flags!

328
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,334
People wonder if I'm a string of international flags,

329
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:33,000
or the flags of many nations, but I'm actually both!

330
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:34,500
"Don't sweat the small stuff."

331
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:36,625
That's the last thing my father ever said to me.

332
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:39,500
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 14.

333
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,000
Look forward to it!
