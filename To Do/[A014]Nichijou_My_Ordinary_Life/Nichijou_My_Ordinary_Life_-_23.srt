1
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:03,777
<i>Selamat pagi</i> !

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,379
Huh? I'm the first one here?

3
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:12,796
Stag beetle dance, yeah.

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,421
You having fun there? Nice moves.

5
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,588
What are you doing here
so early in the morning, Mr. Takasaki?

6
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:19,588
Well, I am on morning duty today.

7
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,171
I know. Why don't you come and help me

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,379
take out all the school's garbage?

9
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:23,091
Yeah, sure!

10
00:00:23,194 --> 00:00:25,296
As long as you don't tell anyone about what you just saw!

11
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,838
You don't have to worry about that.

12
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:28,713
Of course I'm gonna worry!

13
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:34,421
That was a close one.

14
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:07,421
Hey, Mio?

15
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:08,671
Hm?

16
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,879
I whipped up a batch of homemade jam yesterday.

17
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,379
Wanna taste it for me?

18
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:15,421
That's kind of random, but, yeah, why not?

19
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:17,296
I used up all of your marmalade the other day,

20
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,129
so I figured I'd make it up to you.

21
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:19,963
Oh, yeah.

22
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,504
Well, thanks, I guess.

23
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:23,921
I never would've expected you to pull something like this.

24
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:25,338
It's almost like you're a responsible

25
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:26,504
and considerate grown-up.

26
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:28,588
I can have my moments, you know!

27
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,879
Now, go ahead and try it and tell me what you think.

28
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:33,754
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

29
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,629
Gross!

30
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:39,213
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

31
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:41,588
It's like my taste buds are drowning in sewage!

32
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:44,629
Here! I made some Russian tea to wash it down.

33
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:47,671
Hot!

34
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:48,963
It burns! It burns!

35
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:51,171
Not just 'cause it's hot, but it's gross, too!

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,963
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew...

37
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:54,129
All right, then, uh,

38
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:55,546
maybe some more jam will help?

39
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,088
Why?!

40
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:58,921
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew,

41
00:02:59,004 --> 00:02:59,879
ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew...

42
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:02,546
Water!

43
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,338
Where's the water? I need water!

44
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,796
Some good, clean H2O!

45
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,088
I could drink a whole lake right freakin' now!

46
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:11,879
Water! I need it! I need it!

47
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:14,379
Water!

48
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:17,838
Why?

49
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:20,713
I know!

50
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:24,421
Milk! That'll do!

51
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,004
It's just what I need!

52
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:29,254
Oh, heads up.

53
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:30,921
I put the rest of the jam in that milk carton.

54
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:32,504
Why?!

55
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,838
This is the worst thing I've ever experienced

56
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,879
in my entire life! Ever!

57
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:39,838
What'd I do to deserve this? Who'd I hurt?

58
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:42,463
What'd I do wrong? Nothing! It's not fair!

59
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:45,504
I just get shafted every time!

60
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,046
That was weird.

61
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,254
Doin' okay there?

62
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:24,463
Just look at me!

63
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,004
How could you even ask that?

64
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:27,463
My life was flashing before my eyes

65
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:29,088
and it's all because of your stupid jam!

66
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:31,129
So, no, I'm not okay, and it's all your fault!

67
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:32,671
I knew that it wouldn't taste good,

68
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:34,963
but I didn't think you'd have such an extreme reaction.

69
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:36,546
If you knew it tasted like garbage,

70
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,004
then why'd you make me taste it?

71
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:39,254
No reason, really.

72
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:40,671
I just thought it might be kinda funny. Ha, ha.

73
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:42,421
You are the actual worst!

74
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:45,046
But anyway! Question for you.

75
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,296
What kind of jam do you think this is, huh?

76
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,379
Who cares? I don't wanna think about some goop

77
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:50,671
that tastes like rotten fish!

78
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:53,171
Close!

79
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:00,171
You got the "fish" part right.

80
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:01,963
Except that it's dried!

81
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:04,629
Why?!

82
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:07,254
That was the first and last time...

83
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:09,463
...I ever had dried fish.

84
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:38,713
Ah!

85
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:52,379
Mako?

86
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:53,754
I'm ordering take-out tonight

87
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:55,588
since Dad's not gonna be home until late,

88
00:05:55,671 --> 00:05:58,796
so let me know what you wanna eat!

89
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,296
He always makes such a mess.

90
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,171
Just look at all this!

91
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:05,463
Even after I told him to tidy up.

92
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:08,796
He never listens unless somebody scolds him.

93
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,754
Huh?

94
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,879
Wait, this couldn't possibly be

95
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:29,504
what I think it is, could it?

96
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:31,713
Maybe it is? It is, isn't it?

97
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,213
Hey!

98
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,671
Why are you snooping around in my room?

99
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:41,379
I wasn't snooping! I, uh...

100
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:44,213
I told you before, you're not allowed in here!

101
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:46,254
If you invade my personal space again,

102
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:48,296
I'll, uh, uh, you know, whatever!

103
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,088
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:55,338
Huh? Uh--

105
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:06,213
Be strong.

106
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:08,004
He needs to learn his lesson.

107
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:08,581
Hey!

108
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:11,379
What did I just say about invasion of personal space?

109
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,379
Huh? Well, I just, uh...

110
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:14,629
Who told you that you could barge in

111
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:16,504
and clean my room anyway? Jeez!

112
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,671
Well, if you refuse to clean it yourself,

113
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:19,921
then you leave me no--

114
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,254
It's my organized mess, and you're ruining it!

115
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:24,088
Just stay out of my business!

116
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:30,463
Mako!

117
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:31,713
Really? Did you not hear me

118
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:33,129
the first two times or something?

119
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:34,671
Well...

120
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,921
As your sister,

121
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:37,129
I think you're too young

122
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:40,046
to be looking at lewd things like this!

123
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,338
As your sister,

124
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,504
I think you're too young

125
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,963
to be looking at lewd things like this!

126
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,171
As your sister,

127
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:47,338
I think you're too young

128
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,088
to be looking at lewd things like this!

129
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:51,463
Wait. How did you find...?

130
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,671
That's, uh...

131
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:56,338
I... I can explain...

132
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:57,879
I, uh...

133
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,379
That's... uh...

134
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:13,338
What is that? Huh?

135
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:15,463
Weird! That's new!

136
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:16,713
Never seen it!

137
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,463
Never in my whole life!

138
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:20,713
But I just found this under <i>your</i> bed in <i>your</i> room!

139
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:21,879
Really?

140
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:23,254
Well, that's crazy 'cause it isn't mine!

141
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:24,629
And just because you found it in my room

142
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,004
doesn't mean squat!

143
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,171
Someone could've planted it there for all you know!

144
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:28,754
You're so smart, you ever think of that?

145
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:31,213
Regardless, I still think you
shouldn't be exposed to this.

146
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,046
You're too young!

147
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:32,785
What?

148
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,838
How could I be exposed to something that isn't even mine?

149
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:35,921
I didn't even know it was there,

150
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:37,879
so there's no reason to freak out!

151
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:39,879
If that's the case, then I'll throw it away!

152
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:40,879
Huh?

153
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:04,046
That's my club president's!

154
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,338
What?

155
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,046
I can't believe you would throw away something

156
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,379
that isn't yours!

157
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:10,129
I'm so sorry!

158
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:12,546
Also, I couldn't help but take a peek inside,

159
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,546
and it was fascinating, to be honest.

160
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,379
But... I still think you shouldn't

161
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:19,004
look at things like that.

162
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:20,754
At least not till you're older.

163
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,713
I get it already, "no looking"!

164
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,338
Now get out of my room and stay out!

165
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:30,296
She is stressing me the heck out.

166
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,254
What does Mr. Takasaki see in her anyway?

167
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,713
Please don't be mad at me.

168
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:36,338
Could you at least try knocking, for once?

169
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,546
Well, I was just worried that

170
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:39,588
you might be angry with me, so...

171
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:41,129
I'm not angry with you!

172
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,879
See? I knew you'd be upset.

173
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:44,421
I said I wasn't!

174
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:46,921
If you don't get out though,
that could change pretty quick.

175
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,671
Don't forget to knock next time! You hear me?

176
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,629
See what happens if you don't!

177
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:54,463
Ugh, can I just move out already?

178
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:57,879
I don't think that went well at all.

179
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:00,088
But I was able to clean up his room a little bit,

180
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:01,213
so that's good.

181
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:03,879
And I'm glad that magazine wasn't his.

182
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:05,504
This whole ordeal just reminds me

183
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,588
that I have kids at school to take care of.

184
00:10:07,671 --> 00:10:09,463
So, I need to shape up

185
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:12,046
if I want to be a good guidance counselor!

186
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,004
Be the change you want to see.

187
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:17,421
I almost forgot to ask.

188
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:19,463
Hey, Mako? What do you want for dinner?

189
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:20,838
How many times do I have to tell you

190
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,963
to knock before you get it?!

191
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,088
Let's see.

192
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:32,254
I just wanted to ask you if you've

193
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:33,838
thought about your plans for the future.

194
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:35,754
Are there any goals or aspirations you have

195
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:38,338
that you want to achieve after you graduate high school?

196
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:39,921
Uh, yeah, sure.

197
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:48,379
--So, uh... --Oh!

198
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:51,713
I wanna be on TV at least once before I die!

199
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:53,546
Uh--well, that's good,

200
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:56,171
but not exactly what I was asking for.

201
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:57,546
I apologize.

202
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,713
Maybe my wording wasn't quite clear enough for you.

203
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:01,296
I was referring to what you'd like to do

204
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,213
for your job and the career paths you'd like to pursue.

205
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,754
Oh. I get it.

206
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,629
In that case, yeah. I guess...

207
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:10,213
I'd, uh...

208
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:12,546
Maybe...

209
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,463
I guess I'd like to become a respectable teacher

210
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:15,838
like you one day!

211
00:11:17,254 --> 00:11:20,046
You think... that I'm a...

212
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:23,963
Huh?

213
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,213
Helvetica Standard.

214
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:35,713
The sash represents... our bond!

215
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,129
It's all you!

216
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:38,629
Nakamura!

217
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:44,671
This is... the last race... of our college careers!

218
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:52,588
Disqualified.

219
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,754
Tokisadame College has been disqualified.

220
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,129
Oh, hey, Nano!

221
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:07,546
Yes? What's up?

222
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,546
Sorry we didn't show up at your place the other day.

223
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,046
We were on our way over,

224
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,546
but then we got attacked by some dogs out of nowhere.

225
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,963
Wow, I'm glad you guys are okay.

226
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,379
We'll be sure to stop by

227
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:20,046
and see you and Hakase sometime soon though, I promise!

228
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,838
I look forward to it!

229
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,713
Please be our adviser, Mr. Takasaki!

230
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:30,963
I said it once, and I'll say it again: No!

231
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:31,985
Come on!

232
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,713
We had a deal, and you have to
keep up your end of the bargain!

233
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,796
Huh? I never made a deal with you!

234
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,046
What? Did, too!

235
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,504
Don't you remember we agreed that

236
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,463
if I defeated you in a Go+Soccer match,

237
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,588
then you would become the adviser of our club?

238
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:47,921
Oh, yeah, that one.

239
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,004
Well! That match ended in a draw anyway,

240
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:51,088
so it doesn't count!

241
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,713
Really?

242
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:54,129
Fine.

243
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:56,171
Guess I'll tell everyone how you feel about my sister.

244
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:01,838
Show me the way to the club room.

245
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:04,171
It's over here!

246
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:07,504
All right! Now we can finally have a real club!

247
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:08,921
Yeah!

248
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,296
President!

249
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:14,921
Huh?

250
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:17,379
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you!

251
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,796
But, anyway,

252
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,546
I brought a teacher who agreed to be our new adviser!

253
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,254
Hey, get back here!

254
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:24,671
Why are you running?

255
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:26,629
Mr. Takasaki!

256
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,379
I wonder where he's going.

257
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:31,129
We're all supposed to be getting ready for recruitment.

258
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:32,046
Without him around,

259
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:33,379
no one'll be able to explain

260
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:36,004
what the club is actually supposed to do.

261
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:39,171
Eh! Whatever!

262
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:42,088
This is my club, so I guess I'll keep doin' what I want!

263
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:52,004
Man. I'm freakin' out right now.

264
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:54,754
Why the heck are you getting so nervous, anyway?

265
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:57,504
You're planning on confessing to that one guy, aren't you?

266
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,129
Nakanojou or something?

267
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,004
Uh-huh! He's like a beacon of punk

268
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:02,671
in a sea of plain at this school.

269
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,004
I can't get enough of that mohawk of his.

270
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:07,421
Okay, but are there any other features you like

271
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:08,838
outside of his mohawk?

272
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:13,546
Mr. Takasaki! Come back!

273
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,629
Uh...

274
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:31,463
Finally. Mr. Takasaki.

275
00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:33,213
Why are you running away from me?

276
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:35,379
You're incredible at Go+Soccer.

277
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,338
Our match--it was amazing!

278
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:40,754
There's nobody that's more fit
to advise this club than you!

279
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:42,963
Sorry.

280
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:46,671
I, uh, have reasons, and stuff and things.

281
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:49,379
So, uh, yeah.

282
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:51,171
That's it!

283
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:53,796
Just... take it or leave it... I guess.

284
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,338
But you already agreed to it earlier!

285
00:14:57,421 --> 00:14:59,088
All right, fine.

286
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:01,671
Mr. Takasaki...

287
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:03,129
Take a look at this!

288
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:05,338
I think it might change your mind!

289
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:15,713
No way! This is--!

290
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:17,379
That's right.

291
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:20,671
It's a picture of my sister from
when she was in high school.

292
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,713
So how 'bout it?

293
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:22,921
That's yours,

294
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:25,838
only if you agree to become our club adviser.

295
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:32,129
Crap. I want it!

296
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:34,213
More than anything in my entire life!

297
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,129
But I can't help but feel like I'll regret this

298
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:37,963
if I give in to him now.

299
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,379
Listen.

300
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:41,671
Uh-huh?

301
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:46,754
I just can't...

302
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:54,629
...pass up this chance!

303
00:15:54,713 --> 00:15:56,421
So I'll take it.

304
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:58,713
What the hell did I just do?!

305
00:15:58,796 --> 00:15:59,796
All right!

306
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,879
Our club will finally have an adviser!

307
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:04,171
How pathetic!

308
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,671
I'm a teacher! I can't behave like this!

309
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:11,254
But... I'm also a man, and a hungry wolf!

310
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,379
Sacrifices must be made!

311
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:16,796
Listen up, now!

312
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,046
If we're gonna do this, then we're gonna do it right!

313
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:20,296
Huh?

314
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,254
You hear me?

315
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:22,754
I do!

316
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:25,171
It's time to show the school what Go+Soccer is all about!

317
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:27,838
Starting tomorrow, we're going all out!

318
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,004
Right!

319
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:36,504
Is this the place?

320
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:38,379
Wow! That's crazy.

321
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,838
--'Scuse me! --Huh?

322
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:40,921
Hello.

323
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:42,754
Is there a guy named Nakanojou here?

324
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:44,504
Yeah! There is!

325
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,671
Hey, Nakanojou!

326
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,004
You've got company.

327
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:49,421
In the hall!

328
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:53,754
Yes?

329
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,254
How can I help you?

330
00:16:58,546 --> 00:17:01,213
Uh? Uhh?

331
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:03,754
He's so lame now.

332
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:26,629
Hey, um, Dad?

333
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,379
Can you go and check it for me?

334
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:30,671
Yeah. Of course.

335
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:32,004
Hmm...

336
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:40,463
How is it?

337
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:45,588
Uh...

338
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:56,588
Uh... What's that mean?

339
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:23,129
The train is temporarily delayed.

340
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:37,213
Uh--oh, hey, Mai. I didn't expect you.

341
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,046
I came here to play.

342
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:43,754
How thoughtful!

343
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:46,129
But you didn't have to bring this many snacks with you.

344
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:47,254
--Hey! --Huh?

345
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:48,629
That's the mean girl with the mean dogs

346
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:49,671
that tried to eat me!

347
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,504
Huh?

348
00:18:55,254 --> 00:18:56,338
Here.

349
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,379
It was her for sure!

350
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:04,338
Well, I'm gonna go put on some tea. I'll be right back.

351
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:11,879
What business do you have here?

352
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:17,546
For you.

353
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:18,796
And what is that?

354
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:20,088
The lord of death.

355
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:21,129
I'll pass.

356
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:23,463
But this is really cool.

357
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,921
Well I don't think it is, so there.

358
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,171
How about this? Interesting?

359
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,421
What even is that?

360
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:35,671
A 36 room apartment layout.

361
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:37,546
How is that interesting at all?

362
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:39,713
No bath, toilet, or windows.

363
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:41,463
That sounds awful.

364
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:52,713
Whatcha drawin' over there?

365
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,588
I'm drawin' a buncha nunya.

366
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:04,504
Here.

367
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:05,629
Hm?

368
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:07,129
It's a Blue Shark.

369
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:12,504
That's so cool!

370
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,129
For you.

371
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,463
Really?

372
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,879
Hey, do you think you can draw me another shark?

373
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:20,088
Okay.

374
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:21,421
Draw one with a big, toothy smile!

375
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:22,629
Okay.

376
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,171
I can trade you mine if you wanna!

377
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:25,338
Okay.

378
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:29,004
Sorry to keep you waiting--

379
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:32,421
Huh?

380
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:39,171
Wait, so, what happened? Did Mai already go home?

381
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:41,546
Yeah. But she said that she'd come back soon

382
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:43,171
and draw me more sharks.

383
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:44,879
Oh, did she now?

384
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:48,421
Wonder if that's why she stopped by.

385
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:23,796
So amazing.

386
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:29,379
I'm a graduation photo!

387
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:32,004
If people saw me and said, "Wow,
you looked so cute back then!"

388
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:34,796
You'd say, "What are you implying? Am I not cute now?"

389
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:36,213
Wouldn't you?

390
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:39,088
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 24.

391
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:40,671
Look forward to it!
