1
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:18,459
Man, it's so hot out.

2
00:00:18,543 --> 00:00:20,584
Super-duper hot!

3
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:23,668
Ah. Can you cut it out? I feel it.

4
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:25,584
This heat has been hard on me, too.

5
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:29,959
But ya know, when you bring it
up, it makes it worse, 'kay?

6
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:32,043
So could you stop saying it's hot?

7
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:34,793
Okay, okay.

8
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:37,501
Man, it's a scorcher out here!

9
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:39,876
It's blistering. Sweltering, even!

10
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,126
Do ya know what I mean, man?

11
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:46,084
Feels like I'm in an oven! I'm baking out here! Broiling!

12
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:47,293
So humid!

13
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:48,959
I could punch him right now.

14
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:49,876
Nobody would know.

15
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,876
What's with the sun?

16
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,209
This gotta be a record!

17
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:55,584
Dude, seriously, it is like fire!

18
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,251
What a beautiful day!

19
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:31,959
The sky is blue, birds are chirping,

20
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,959
butterflies are fluttering.

21
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:39,876
The air, the people, and yes, even this very classroom.

22
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,501
Everything is great!

23
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:45,751
Because... I actually did the homework for today!

24
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,168
I bet Mio willl get a real kick outta this.

25
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:56,168
Huh?

26
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:58,834
Hang on. Oh, no.

27
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:02,168
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

28
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:03,959
No!

29
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:09,584
It can't be! You've gotta be kidding me!

30
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:11,793
The one time I actually did my homework?

31
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:12,959
Why?

32
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:17,001
Why did this have to happen? Why me?

33
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:19,084
Oh, well, guess I'll just have to copy it again.

34
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,418
Hey, Mio, question!

35
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,876
Hm?

36
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,709
Wait, our homework.

37
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:29,876
That's right. We had to... fill in a worksheet!

38
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,334
What's the matter with you?

39
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,751
Did something happen, Yuuko?

40
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,793
My homework. I left it at home.

41
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:45,376
There's no hope. There's nothing good in this world.

42
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,293
But you always forget to do your homework.

43
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,751
It's different this time!

44
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,584
I did it, but I didn't bring it!

45
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:52,751
Uh, yeah, okay I hear ya.

46
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,168
It's the worksheet we got yesterday, right?

47
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:57,584
You sure it isn't jammed inside your bag somewhere?

48
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:59,376
Check one more time to see.

49
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,418
I just turned this whole thing inside-out and got nothing.

50
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,168
There's no way it's--

51
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,918
Whoa!

52
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,709
My God!

53
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:16,043
Ah! What the hell is a Daifuku Fair?!

54
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:18,209
What's fair? Nothing.

55
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:20,418
Uh, don't worry about it.

56
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,918
Hey, who knows?

57
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,501
Maybe there's an extra that was left on the front desk.

58
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,418
Are you for real? It's a miracle!

59
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:33,959
Dammit!

60
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:37,793
Dammit, dammit! Damn all of it!

61
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:40,668
Are you going back home? But there's no time!

62
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,918
You're right. But I have to... try!

63
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,251
Uh.

64
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,626
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

65
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,459
Go and take your seats.

66
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,293
Twisty, twisty, twisty, twisty,

67
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:47,251
twisty, twisty, spinning, and spinning...

68
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:50,501
Slow and steady wins the race.

69
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:54,959
Out in the hall again.

70
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:57,751
Why is it that I can never get my homework in?

71
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,209
Am I cursed?

72
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:02,668
I always end up failing. Even when I actually finish it.

73
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,251
School is a cruel mistress.

74
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:32,709
Hey, Sakamoto.

75
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:33,626
Hm?

76
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,543
Look at my business card.

77
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:40,459
Uh? What is this about? What do I say?

78
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,043
What's happening?

79
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,626
What am I supposed to do with this?

80
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:05,918
Excuse me!

81
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:10,209
What seems to be the problem, Miss Tachibana?

82
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:12,876
Uh, nothing!

83
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,668
The vending machine got some new drinks,

84
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,501
and I was just deciding on which one I wanted.

85
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,793
Oh. Is that so?

86
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:21,126
Well, then, I recommend--

87
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:23,126
I don't need you to tell me what to get!

88
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,918
...you stay away from this option,

89
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:28,376
but the one next to it is actually quite refreshing.

90
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,418
Enjoy your drink.

91
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,334
It's not like I bought this
drink because you pointed at it!

92
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:00,918
I heard the neighborhood had

93
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:04,293
some pop-up stalls, so I decided to check them out.

94
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,543
I am so excited that this game is here.

95
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,334
A carnival shooting gallery!

96
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:10,959
I've never seen one in real life!

97
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:14,334
But all I have on me is a 500 yen coin.

98
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:15,751
I hope it'll be enough.

99
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,293
Step right up! One round is 500 yen!

100
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:19,376
Perfect!

101
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,209
Isn't that convenient?!

102
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,918
I wish I had enough for some <i>yakisoba</i> , too.

103
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,876
But this'll be worth it.

104
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,001
There's only caramels and eggplants?

105
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:37,584
Uh... Do you have any other prizes?

106
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:39,459
Whaddaya mean other prizes?

107
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:42,876
We've only got the finest quality, brand-name goods here!

108
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:45,959
He already took my money,

109
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,751
so I might as well go for it.

110
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,876
Don't wanna leave empty handed.

111
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,293
Nice try, Miss,

112
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:03,293
but you shouldn't shoot for the grand prize right away.

113
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,834
Beginner's luck won't help you with that one!

114
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:07,209
Grand prize?

115
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:08,918
Why don't you aim for something smaller?

116
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,876
It's prob'ly more your speed!

117
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,751
Go ahead!

118
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,251
More my speed?

119
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:16,668
Whatever. Might as well go for the only other option.

120
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,543
So close!

121
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:32,168
Okay, that box has to be glued down.

122
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,709
Just a little more you and woulda had it.

123
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:37,459
Looks like you're a pretty good sharpshooter there, Miss!

124
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,459
Don't tell me. You're not a professional gunman, are you?

125
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:41,876
Yeah, as if!

126
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:50,543
Ah! That thing isn't budging an inch!

127
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:53,334
Oh, no. What're you making that face for?

128
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:56,376
You aren't thinking that the game is rigged, now are you?

129
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,084
Yeah, my stall might not be the fanciest one out there,

130
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:02,459
but an honest and genuine experience is guaranteed!

131
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:03,793
Yeah, right.

132
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:06,001
There's definitely something fishy going on here.

133
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,668
What is that?

134
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,001
Ah! Look! Right in the middle!

135
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:33,876
There's a nail! You totally nailed down that eggplant!

136
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,834
I'd call this whole thing a racket, wouldn't you?

137
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:41,293
Come on! Why are you giving me the silent treatment now?

138
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:44,709
Have you no shame for preying on innocent people?

139
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,168
I bet this entire operation is rigged!

140
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:48,626
And what happened to all that big talk

141
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,876
you were spewing earlier, huh?

142
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:53,709
What's the point in pretending to sleep?

143
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:55,043
I've still got one shot left

144
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:57,709
and I have a pretty good idea where to put it!

145
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:00,751
Hm?

146
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:27,918
Don't ever come back.

147
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,751
Like I'd want to.

148
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,334
Things we think are freakin' cool!

149
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,793
Ready, Mio? Here it comes!

150
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,876
Hey, nice catch!

151
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,668
Wow! Super bouncy balls!

152
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,626
Things we think are freakin' cool!

153
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:27,751
Aw! I had it!

154
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:56,501
Wow!

155
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:59,334
Slipstreams! Created by cards!

156
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,751
Thanks a bunch!

157
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:13,959
I haven't been to an amusement park in forever!

158
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,834
Right? This is so fun!

159
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:18,001
Hey, hand me my wallet, I'm gonna get a drink.

160
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:21,584
Oh. Yeah, sure. I totally forgot I was holding on to it.

161
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,668
Thanks for that.

162
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,418
But you know me; I'd probably lose it.

163
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,834
Ha! Yeah, I guess that's true.

164
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:29,918
Hm?

165
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:31,126
Wait, wha...?

166
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:32,834
Just hold on a second.

167
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:34,834
AH! Because I know it's inside this zipper pocket,

168
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:35,918
or maybe that one.

169
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:37,459
Hang on, I know I put it in my bag.

170
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:38,959
It should be right here, but it's not,

171
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:41,001
so maybe I might have...

172
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:48,584
I kinda, sorta, definitely lost your wallet.

173
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,459
I know!

174
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:58,668
Why don't we check the Lost and Found!

175
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,584
Maybe someone turned it in!

176
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:04,751
How much did you have in there?

177
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,209
Four thousand and sixteen yen.

178
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:07,876
That's specific.

179
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:10,876
Uh, we're looking for a brown bifold wallet.

180
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,876
And it has a snakeskin interior.

181
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,168
Ah, we have one just like it.

182
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,418
That was close. Aren't you glad we found it?

183
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:19,937
Yeah.

184
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,834
I dunno what I would've actually done if I lost everything.

185
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:27,043
Attention: This is an announcement

186
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,876
regarding a lost child.

187
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,293
Please listen carefully.

188
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:32,084
A young girl has been found.

189
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:33,334
She is wearing a denim shirt

190
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:35,084
that is tucked into denim shorts.

191
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:36,793
Her hat is also made of denim.

192
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,376
She is currently looking for her mother.

193
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,043
If you have any information,

194
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:44,001
please come to the lost child station immediately.

195
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:12,168
I have no clue why I thought a stupid haunted house

196
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:13,126
was a good idea!

197
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:25,709
'Kay, say cheese!

198
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:58,751
Your order is three lattes.

199
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,334
Is there anything else you'd like?

200
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,668
Oh, uh! I think...

201
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:06,459
I'd like this one, this one, and this one please.

202
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:08,793
Uh. I'm terribly sorry, miss.

203
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:11,668
But could you please provide a
specific name for the orders?

204
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,001
Oh, it's Sakurai.

205
00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:16,376
Uh, that's not exactly what I meant.

206
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:18,418
Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

207
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:21,293
It's Izumi. The name's Izumi Sakurai.

208
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:24,084
Sorry, but I wasn't asking for your full name, either.

209
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:25,501
Sorry!

210
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,209
I've been told it sounds like I have two last names,

211
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:28,834
so I thought you were confused.

212
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:30,709
Well, I didn't mean your name.

213
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:33,418
All I need is the names of the items that you want.

214
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:37,251
Huh? You want names of the items?

215
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:40,043
I'm sorry, but I don't know what they are.

216
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:43,918
Oh! No. It's okay. I'm sorry for the trouble!

217
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,668
Yum, that food hit the spot!

218
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,251
I'm officially stuffed!

219
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,793
But I still have some room left in my dessert stomach.

220
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:58,418
Same here.

221
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:08,001
Cool! I'll do one too!

222
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,293
Here's mine!

223
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,334
I'm done, too.

224
00:17:30,793 --> 00:17:33,959
Whoa! Awesome! Your stuff's great as usual.

225
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:36,209
What did you make? Done yet?

226
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,334
A crane?

227
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,293
Nano! Check it out!

228
00:17:50,376 --> 00:17:52,793
Ta-da!

229
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:54,918
I put a big key on my back, too!

230
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,751
Isn't this cool? Now we're matching and stuff.

231
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,459
Yeah, I guess we are.

232
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:01,834
Since I'm like you now, I'm gonna be Nano all day,

233
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:03,876
so no calling me "Hakase," okay?

234
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,501
Okay, "Nano," you got it.

235
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,626
Meow-ch!

236
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:10,251
Already?

237
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:12,293
Uh, Hakase, did you quit, or...?

238
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:16,126
It's "Nano"! I'm being you right now!

239
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,376
Oh, well, I just figured since you took

240
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:20,043
the key off of your back.

241
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:22,959
I'm just giving my back a break right now.

242
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,126
I'm still Nano all day today.

243
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:28,959
Right. Understood.

244
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,418
Hey, Hakase--I mean, "Nano."

245
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,918
I have an idea for a game we can play!

246
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,626
Do ya? What'cha got?

247
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,043
Since you're being me,

248
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,709
then why don't we switch places and I can be you today?

249
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:49,876
You bet!

250
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,001
So then, Hakase--I mean, Nano,

251
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:53,584
would have to put her key on.

252
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:54,876
Sure!

253
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,709
And since I'm Hakase now,

254
00:18:57,793 --> 00:18:59,751
that means I should get this key off my back.

255
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,251
Not a chance.

256
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:05,001
So, what do you wanna play first? Like cards or something?

257
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:13,584
Wow, these snacks are yummy!

258
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:15,834
Those are mine! And I was saving them for later!

259
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:21,001
But now... I'm Hakase... so I get all your snacks.

260
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:25,918
Ah! That doesn't make any sense!

261
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,376
I can Nano, but if Nano is me and gets to eat my snacks,

262
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,751
then I don't wanna be Nano anymore,

263
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,209
and Nano can just stay being Nano.

264
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:34,626
Keep it down.

265
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:39,001
Since everything is back to normal and I'm Nano again,

266
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:40,376
I guess I'm gonna go to the store

267
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,251
and get groceries for tonight's dinner.

268
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,959
Huh? I wanna go, too!

269
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:46,543
We're not gonna buy any snacks while we're out.

270
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:47,834
I'm gonna get a chocolate shark

271
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:48,918
and some apple juice!

272
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,001
Not a chance.

273
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:51,834
--Oh, come on! --No way.

274
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,418
Just the chocolate shark then!

275
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:55,876
It's another peaceful day

276
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,376
at the Shinonome Household.

277
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:11,168
The first one that says anything loses the game.

278
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,543
Okay.

279
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:16,126
Oh. You just said something, so that means you lost.

280
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,626
You didn't say when we were starting,

281
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,459
so technically, I'm fine.

282
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:21,126
You wanna talk about some random stuff

283
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:24,668
to get it out of our system before we start?

284
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:27,418
You have anything you wanna talk about?

285
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:39,876
Okay.

286
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:15,043
Carbonation makes drinks fizzy,

287
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:17,459
which really seems to wake you up.

288
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:33,626
I was out.

289
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,168
Good morning.

290
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:38,334
It looks like sleeping beauty woke up without her kiss.

291
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:39,418
Hm?

292
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,209
That sucks.

293
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:49,584
And why is that?

294
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:28,418
Welcome home, Master!

295
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,709
It's me, Cider!

296
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:32,293
I know my bubbly personality is intoxicating,

297
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,459
so twist off the cap, wiff the fizz,

298
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:36,126
and join my carbon-nation.

299
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:38,918
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 13!

300
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,459
Look forward to it!
