1
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:07,309
Okay, the testing period is over.

2
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:09,726
Yay!

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,934
Whoa. That's quite the celebration.

4
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:15,142
They must be relieved after putting so much effort

5
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:18,434
into their studies. It warms my heart.

6
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:21,476
♪ The test is over! And it was a snap! ♪

7
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,142
My life flashed before my eyes.

8
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:25,767
Am I dreaming? Pinch me as hard as you can!

9
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:28,351
We finished! Nothing can hurt you now.

10
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:30,267
My parents are sending each and every one

11
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:32,017
of you a bag of rice as a gift!

12
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:33,476
Yeah! Thanks rice man!

13
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,476
The two of us are getting married!

14
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:36,642
Wow!

15
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:38,726
Come on! All together now!

16
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:40,184
Hip-hip...

17
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,684
Hooray!

18
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:44,851
What the--? Could you not?

19
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,559
--This is overkill! --Hooray! Hooray!

20
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:35,559
Ah, Mio. Good morrow.

21
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:51,351
No, this is all wrong!

22
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,517
You're supposed to say something like,

23
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:56,059
"Huh? Uh. The heck is that?"

24
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,684
Be surprised!

25
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:01,559
Aw, you're not still mad at me, are you?

26
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:04,101
Can't you just admit it was kinda funny?

27
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,851
I made your mont blanc a Knight.

28
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:10,017
Nah, I still could've eaten it
if I took that chess piece out,

29
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:12,684
so it really wasn't that big of a deal.

30
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:16,892
Yeah, right!

31
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,059
Sis! Why?!

32
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:19,559
How could you do that to me?!

33
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:22,059
I was so looking forward to my dessert, and you knew it!

34
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:24,851
Why did you have to stick a knight on the top?!

35
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:28,226
I guess... I thought it'd look cool.

36
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:29,642
Head!

37
00:03:31,934 --> 00:03:35,642
You'd think she'd be used to my
practical jokes at this point.

38
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,767
Gah, she's so annoying.

39
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:54,101
They only make ten of those mont blancs a day.

40
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:56,476
Not that it matters.

41
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:58,392
Cause even if she knew that,

42
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,684
she's always pulling stuff like this.

43
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,684
I thought now that she's in college,

44
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:05,142
she'd finally understand when to stop.

45
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,226
But whatever, it's fine.

46
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:09,726
I can let it slide for today, because I've got

47
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:13,726
better things to do. And she has absolutely no idea!

48
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:16,184
I knew she'd be up to something, so I was ready.

49
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:19,184
I disguised my shortcake, so it's safe and sound.

50
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:20,309
Ahh!

51
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:25,684
Checkmate! She got me!

52
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,184
I can't believe she freakin' got me!

53
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:30,892
The strawberry!

54
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:33,017
She stole the crown jewel of my rare,

55
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:36,309
only-five-made-per-day gourmet shortcake!

56
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,976
Don't you worry, Strawberry! I'm coming for you!

57
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,351
Hold on!

58
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:43,351
Where is it?

59
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:48,351
What did you do to my precious, delicious, sweet...?!

60
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,392
Namaste.

61
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,267
Gut!

62
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:01,767
Why are you so mean to me?

63
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:03,601
A shortcake without the strawberry

64
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:06,059
isn't special anymore!

65
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,226
Now it's just a stupid, normal piece of shortcake!

66
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:31,434
♪ Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me ♪

67
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:36,434
♪ Happy birthday dear Yoshino ♪

68
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:41,851

00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,434
Sis...

70
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:48,809
Mio.

71
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,184
Today isn't even your birthday!

72
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:26,434
I've been wanting to try this place for forever!

73
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:28,226
And didn't you see it in a magazine?

74
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:29,226
Sure did.

75
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:31,601
And it came with a coupon!

76
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:32,934
No point in showing it to me.

77
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,559
I'm having the Herring Soba.

78
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:37,184
Ah, hot dish in this weather? You connoisseur.

79
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:38,434
With no herring.

80
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:42,642
Then that's just noodles in water!

81
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,059
Ah...

82
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:46,684
Ah-hem. And what're you going to get, Mio?

83
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:48,809
I think I'm gonna get the Zaru Soba.

84
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:52,392
Ah, the classic pick for a non-foodie That's a safe one.

85
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:54,559
It's good enough for me. What're you getting?

86
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:56,059
I think I'm gonna have myself

87
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:58,267
the Summer Veggie Tempura Special.

88
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,101
It's pretty bold to go with a rice dish at a noodle place.

89
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:01,976
Right?

90
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:03,434
Yeah, if you say so.

91
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:06,809
You get it! It's a seasonal item, too.

92
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,559
This kind of dish is special,

93
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:10,392
so you never know when it'll be back.

94
00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:11,809
Probably next summer.

95
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:13,517
Maybe you don't get it.

96
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,642
Haven't you ever heard of living in the moment, Mio?

97
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:18,976
What matters most is the here and now!

98
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:20,809
Oh, really?

99
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:23,392
I'm sure you'll understand what I mean one day.

100
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,851
Yeah, okay.

101
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:32,892
Excuse me!

102
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:35,184
What would you like to order?

103
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,684
One Herring Soba, a Zaru Soba,

104
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:42,767
and... the seasonal... special dish...

105
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,517
Herring Soba, Zaru Soba, and a Summer Veggie

106
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:49,017
Tempura Special. I'll be back with your order soon.

107
00:07:53,142 --> 00:07:54,767
I heard they make all of their soba noodles

108
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,726
by hand at this place.

109
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,309
Can't get any more authentic than that!

110
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:02,309
Oh, I wonder what this buckwheat dumpling thing is.

111
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:05,434
It's the squishy stuff they make using the soba flour!

112
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,267
Wow, for real?

113
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:09,017
Thank you for waiting.

114
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:12,226
This is the Herring Soba here,

115
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,017
and the order of the Zaru Soba for you.

116
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:19,767
I don't mind if you guys start
eating your food without me!

117
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:20,892
If you're sure...

118
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:22,017
Before it gets cold.

119
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,184
But mine's supposed to be cold.

120
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:27,059
It must be because my order is from the seasonal menu.

121
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:30,476
I bet they're taking extra time and care to make it!

122
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,601
Your food is taking a while.

123
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:54,601
Guess they need extra time to fry all those vegetables.

124
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:58,601
Or maybe they went out to pick 'em, so they're fresh!

125
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:02,476
That's it! No wonder they're slow!

126
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:18,351
I think you could order your food a la carte here too.

127
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,767
Hm, really?

128
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:27,267
Finally!

129
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,226
Another table's.

130
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,767
Too bad.

131
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:37,642
God Dammit!

132
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,267
Hey! Just settle down, Yuuko!

133
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:41,892
How can I?! This is taking freakin' forever!

134
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:43,726
I don't care if they're famous, even if they capture

135
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,142
the flavors, they'll never capture my feelings!

136
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,351
You're not making any sense!

137
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:47,851
They're gonna feel my wrath!

138
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,434
Thank you for waiting.

139
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:51,726
'Bout time! Do you know how long I--

140
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,934
Uh, thanks.

141
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:10,476
You guys can like, read a book or something.

142
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,684
This might take a little bit.

143
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:20,851
Things we think are freakin' cool!

144
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:26,226
Uh.

145
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:31,767
Young chess players!

146
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:50,184
I've got my mosquito repellent going,

147
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:53,476
but I thought it'd be doing more than it is.

148
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,351
They won't leave in the late night.

149
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,101
Mogami River.

150
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:58,309
Ha!

151
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,809
Ha! Huh! H'ya!

152
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,976
Well, it looks like you're just

153
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,267
minding your own business anyway.

154
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:26,101
Guess I'll go crawl back into bed then.

155
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,517
Sneak attack!

156
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:37,601
Victory!

157
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:39,392
Bug off!

158
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:50,851
I have taken a precious life.

159
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:54,559
I'll do it again!

160
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:03,309
I hit! And I smack!

161
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:05,226
But they never learn their lesson!

162
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,851
But what else can I do? I'm running out of options!

163
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:11,976
Listen, Mom!

164
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:14,059
We can't live in this infested house anymore!

165
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:16,892
We just have to move! Now!

166
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,851
Do you have any idea what time it is?!

167
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:30,976
Now shut up and go to sleep!

168
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:05,726
Helvetica Standard.

169
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:10,434
Chirashizushi. You try.

170
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:12,309
Tsurasuzusu.

171
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:17,184
No! Chi-ra-shi-zu-shi!

172

Go!

174

No, no! Chi.

175
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:24,767
Chi.

176
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:25,767
Ra.

177
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:26,851
Ra.

178
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:28,059
Shi.

179
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,434

Yes! Chirashizushi. Go!

185
00:13:38,142 --> 00:13:40,392
Tsurasuzusu.

186
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:03,726
Sakamoto! Check it out!

187
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,267
The bottom of this popsicle says I'm a winner!

188
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:08,892
See, look at it!

189
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:10,934
You really shouldn't be eating that right now.

190
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,351
Why can't I eat it?!

191
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,726
Well because, it's gonna spoil your appetite.

192
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:18,517
Yummy!

193
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,559
I don't get why you got so worked up

194
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:23,934
over a popsicle stick. You're such a child.

195
00:14:24,017 --> 00:14:25,559
It wasn't a normal stick!

196
00:14:25,642 --> 00:14:27,767
I won it upside-down!

197
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:29,976
Doesn't matter which way the stick is going when

198
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,267
the outcome's the same.
So, you found out two bites earlier.

199
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:34,559
Big deal.

200
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:37,142
Seriously. You kids can be so easy to please.

201
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:40,142
You get excited over the smallest things.

202
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,101
It's a crab!

203
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:45,142
They never show up! It's like one in a million!

204
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:48,101
I'm gonna save you for last, little guy!

205
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:53,142
Thank you very much for the meal.

206
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,351
What's this?

207
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:57,226
You've barely eaten any your food, Hakase.

208
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:00,559
Let me guess, you had snacks this afternoon, didn't you?

209
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:02,142
I'm not proud of it.

210
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:05,642
How many times have I told you not to snack before meals?!

211
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:11,392
All gone.

212
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:12,601
All gone?!

213
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:16,309
You ate a whole month's worth of snacks?!

214
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:17,851
That wasn't a compliment!

215
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:19,642
What am I gonna do with you.

216
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:21,517
I only did it because Sakamoto told me to!

217
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:23,017
Is that true?!

218
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,517
Sakamoto said food gets yucky

219
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,351
faster in the summer so I had to do it.

220
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,059
I didn't mean you had to eat all of them.

221
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,976
Snacks go in the tummy. Where else would I put them?

222
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,601
What kind of argument is that?

223
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:44,976
Sakamoto!

224
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:46,767
Why are you even considering her side?

225
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:48,184
If you look at it objectively,

226
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,434
the situation's pretty black-and-white!

227
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:51,851
But you only have black fur.

228
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,351
That's true.

229
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,059
Uh, what does that have to do with anything?

230
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:56,101
That's enough.

231
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:59,226
There's no point in arguing anymore.

232
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,476
I've decided...

233
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,851
Hakase won't be getting her strawberry juice.

234
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:06,101
Uh. I won't eat anymore snacks!

235
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:07,434
I said no.

236
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:09,309
I'll give you my winning popsicle stick!

237
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:10,392
I don't want it!

238
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:12,559
I'll eat all of my vegetables!

239
00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:13,976
You better!

240
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,601
Hmph.

241
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:23,517
I'll take the key off your back!

242
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:29,642
I'll let it slide this one time.

243
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:32,726
But next time, no snacks for a month. I mean it.

244
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:33,976
Okay!

245
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,684
So...

246
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:38,684
Wait, if I give it to her now,

247
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,767
I feel like our deal is gonna fall through.

248
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:44,684
You can have your juice after
you take the key off my back.

249
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:47,476
Ahh!

250
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,226
Fine then. Gimme a sec.

251
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,059
Huh? 'Kay!

252
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:03,809
Hakase!

253
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,309
Your right hand's a loser.

254
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:11,476
How did you even come up with this?!

255
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,809
Not a compliment!

256
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,392
I'd appreciate it if you stopped messing with me.

257
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:18,559
Could you please consider my feelings for a change--

258
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:20,601
You're not listening!

259
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:39,351
Rock, paper, scissors!

260
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:45,892
Mine!

261
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:01,767
If you look hard enough,

262
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:04,434
you can find anything.

263
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:12,684
Oh, Mio! I'm glad you're here.

264
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,642
What do you want, Yoshino?

265
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,726
Something came up, and I was wondering...

266
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:20,184
I said I'd help out the neighborhood association.

267
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,434
Would you please take my place?

268
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,267
Huh? Why don't you ask Mom instead of me?

269
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:27,351
Oh, she's busy playing kick volleyball

270
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:32,226
with her friends. To say thanks, I'll pay you 10,000 yen.

271
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:34,101
I'm counting on you!

272
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,434
I guess I could use the money.

273
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,101
Not like I'm doing anything anyway.

274
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,642
Think I should try a Mohawk fade with some dreads?

275
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:47,434
Check it out! That's so cute!

276
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:50,101
I've been bamboozled!

277
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:52,892
This whole thing sucks! What am I even doing?!

278
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:55,642
How did this happen? Why did I agree to this?

279
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:56,892
Come and get your delicious...

280
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:58,559
The neighborhood association's big plan

281
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:00,892
was to sell <i>daifuku</i> on the street?

282
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:02,184
And with just two people?

283
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,476
Nah, I'll pass.

284
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,934
It's embarrassing!

285
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:06,017
No wait...

286
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,059
It's too embarrassing!

287
00:19:08,142 --> 00:19:10,434
Everyone's staring at me like I'm an idiot!

288
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,142
How am I supposed to draw people in

289
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:15,142
when I'm dressed like their weird Daifuku-Dude mascot?

290
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:17,101
There aren't even any facial features.

291
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:19,351
It's just a plain, white ball for a head!

292
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:22,059
What even makes this mascot a dude, anyway?

293
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:23,684
It's just a big <i>daifuku</i> !

294
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:27,226
Come to think of it, this Daifuku Fair...

295
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,559
...doesn't seem fair to me!

296
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:35,601
Uh. I'm sorry--

297
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:40,392
Sweetie! It's okay!

298
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:43,184
This is the absolute worst.

299
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,934
Whoa! What's that thing?

300
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,351
It looks gross!

301
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:49,351
Take this, gross thingy!

302
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:52,476
Stop it, please! That kinda hurts, so cut it out!

303
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,059
Seriously! I mean it! There's no padding in this costume!

304
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:58,892
Okay, it's starting to really hurt, so please!

305
00:19:58,976 --> 00:19:59,726
Could you just...

306
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,184
Cut it out!

307
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,059
Ah! She's mad! Run for it!

308
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:04,059
Yeah! Let's get outta here!

309
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:05,351
What a freaky freak!

310
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:08,351
Could this get any worse?

311
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:10,017
Huh?

312
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:13,309
Yuuko!

313
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,059
Stop tarnishing the Daifuku reputation.

314
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:35,392
I can't watch. Hand it over.

315
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:36,934
I'll show you!

316
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:39,976
Useless part-timers!

317
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,351
Don't just stand there.

318
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:43,434
Go and work behind the counter.

319
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:44,809
'Kay?

320
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:46,142
Yeah...

321
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:49,809
I swear. This 10,000 yen better be worth it.

322
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:58,767
♪ Tokachi! Azuki beans! ♪

323
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:01,726
--♪ Wasanbon sugar! ♪ --Can I leave?

324
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:04,934
I just wanna go home.

325
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:07,642
Well, I guess these <i>daifuku</i> look pretty nice,

326
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,892
but are they even gonna sell?

327
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:11,351
Excuse me.

328
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:13,017
How much for one of these?

329
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:13,892
A customer!

330
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:15,476
It's, uh...

331
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,434
I have no idea.

332
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:19,934
Uh, sir! How much does one <i>daifuku</i> --

333
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,976
Maybe this was a bad idea.

334
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:24,434
I couldn't run even if I tried!

335
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,809
I'm strawberry filled!

336
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:30,226
Uh, yeah.

337
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:32,392
You could just take it for free.

338
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:34,434
Cool! Lucky me!

339
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,892
Ha!

340
00:23:21,184 --> 00:23:23,601
It's another peaceful day

341
00:23:23,684 --> 00:23:26,517
at the Shinonome household.

342
00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:28,851
Greetings! I'm the King!

343
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,226
Check me out! Looks like I'm pretty isolated.

344
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,892
I better find my chess mates soon!

345
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,601
The set is missing a major piece!

346
00:23:34,684 --> 00:23:36,059
Hope it doesn't get pawned off!

347
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:39,101
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 10!

348
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,851
Look forward to it!
