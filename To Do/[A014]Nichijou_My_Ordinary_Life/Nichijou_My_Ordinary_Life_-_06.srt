1
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:08,334
Sorry it took a while!

2
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:11,042
I present to you the Yuuko special! Here.

3
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:13,876
Whoa! Your twice-cooked pork looks delicious!

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,834
And great timing too! I was getting pretty hangry.

5
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,251
I made sure to throw in a dash of my secret ingredient.

6
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:20,834
I wonder if you'll guess it.

7
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,917
You must've gone all-out if you
put your secret ingredient in.

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,042
Thanks for all the food!

9
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:34,209
Oh. That's the overpowering burst of miso.

10
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:37,042
It's so not subtle at all, not even a little bit.

11
00:00:37,126 --> 00:00:38,959
No, yeah, that's all I'm getting.

12
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:41,126
Not much of a "secret" ingredient.

13
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:44,459
Ugh, now it's starting to taste worse the longer I chew.

14
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:45,626
You know what?

15
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:48,501
This is one secret I wish I didn't know!

16
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:35,792
Wow, this isn't half bad!

17
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:37,167
Hey, Mio! Check it out!

18
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:38,126
Uh.

19
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,542
The heck is this?

20
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:50,376
A kappa? Why would she show me her weirdo drawing?

21
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,917
And does she really think this thing looks good?

22
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,542
But you know.

23
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:00,626
I do like the idea of drawing some sort of mythical

24
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,542
or fantasy-themed story.

25
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,459
Like this kappa and a <i>daidarabotchi</i> or something.

26
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:07,459
Kappa, hmm.

27
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:08,917
He'd be the bottom.

28
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:10,167
Kappa...

29
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:11,251
Kappa?

30
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:12,292
Huh?

31
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,292
Kappa... Kappa...

32
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:16,084
Pa... Parasite.

33
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:18,709
Heh. Might as well turn this into one of those

34
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:21,001
last-syllable drawing games.

35
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:22,417
Here you go.

36
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,209
Cool, thanks.

37
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:26,876
A parasite?

38
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,542
Is that what a parasite is supposed to look like?

39
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:35,042
Wait, does this little arrow mean what I think it means?

40
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:38,292
She's challenging me to a word-chain game with pictures!

41
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:40,126
Well, I accept your challenge!

42
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,792
Let's see, parasite.

43
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,834
Site... Tuh... Tuh...

44
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,251
Got it!

45
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:53,959
It's huge! What is that even supposed be?

46
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:57,501
A tengu maybe? Sure, let's go with that.

47
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:58,709
Whatever.

48
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:01,584
Tengu it is. Now, what starts with a "G-U"?

49
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,001
Guh... Goo...

50
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:06,917
Gah! Are you kidding me? <i>Tengo</i> ?

51
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,834
What the heck is a "tengo" anyway?!

52
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,626
Wait! Hold on a sec!

53
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,251
This has to be on purpose, right?

54
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,626
There's no way someone could make

55
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,417
such a basic spelling mistake.

56
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:19,667
Then again, it is Yuuko,
so we're kinda grading on a curve.

57
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,667
I don't get her at all.

58
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:26,376
It doesn't make any sense, but I just have to move on.

59
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:29,167
Starting with "G-O," huh?

60
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,917
Here.

61
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:38,917
Oh. Whoa, what's with the sensual-looking dude?

62
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:41,167
Wait. Goku?

63
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:45,167
But the last thing I drew on
my turn was a tengu, wasn't it?

64
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,876
Oh well, I guess it was an honest mistake.

65
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,876
It could happen to anybody, so I'll let it slide.

66
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,001
I'll give her crap about it later.

67
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,292
Let's see.

68
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:58,292
So, the next one can start with a "U." 'Kay!

69
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:05,917
Uh...

70
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:10,001
An eel? Wait, rabbit?

71
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:13,376
It's a cow? That looks udderly terrible!

72
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,501
Here.

73
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,792
Ohh! A tongue?

74
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:23,417
So that's how we're playing!

75
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,709
So, "shita" would end it a "T-A."

76
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,584
Then how 'bout Taxi.

77
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,376
Huh? Ah! What the hell?

78
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,376
You cannot be serious right now!

79
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,876
How hard is it to spell Taxi?!

80
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:47,167
Whatever, I'll keep playing along.

81
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,709
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

82
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,542
She really is trying to keep me on my toes!

83
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:54,334
Breakin' out the slang, huh? Okay, I see you.

84
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:57,459
Oh. Oh, crap! This ends with an "N"!

85
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,876
If I pass that over, I lose. Stupid rules.

86
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,376
Okay. Quick fix.

87
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,501
Thanks.

88
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:21,501
I'm so bored.

89
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,501
I said I'm bored, Sekiguchi.

90
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:38,167
Hey, I have an idea! Let's play a game of Issei-no-Sei!

91
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:39,792
I'm gonna go first!

92
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:43,084
Issei-no-Two!

93
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,209
Aw, man come on.

94
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:54,792
I've got nothing to do, so try to play along.

95
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:56,042
Take a look.

96
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:00,876
Did you really...?

97
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,667
Forget your homework.

98
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:12,959
Forced to stand out in the hall.

99
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,376
Uh... "Mogami River"

100
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,459
by Yuuko.

101
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,584
I can't believe I have to stand in the hallway

102
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,667
just because I forgot one little assignment.

103
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,709
I'm stuck in the hall. What to do to pass the time?

104
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:34,042
"Mogami River" by Yuuko.

105
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,376
Wha--?

106
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,959
Uh, wha--? What the--?

107
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:45,876
Why is there a--

108
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,626
Guys? Anyone? There's a deer.

109
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,667
What? The principal is out there with it?

110
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:01,459
The principal! He's gonna... The deer!

111
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,459
There's a deer!

112
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:14,042
Oh, no! Someone get help!

113
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,001
The principal is...

114
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,626
Is that... a cookie?

115
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,542
Somebody, please! It's the principal! He's...

116
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:40,001
Oh my god.

117
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:46,876
[YUUKO He's up!

118
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,542
He jumped!

119
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:55,542
Ahh! And he ate it!

120
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:58,501
He's getting up again!

121
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,626
He changed his mind!

122
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:08,251
Is it a stalemate?

123
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:12,084
It's not!

124
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:15,917
He's dead!

125
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:19,126
Ohh! Guys! There's a death!

126
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,167
He died! He's dying!

127
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,167
He's on his feet!

128
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,667
Hey! Anyone?

129
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,376
Everyone! You're not gonna--!

130
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,376
U-Uh. I mean... There's um...

131
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,709
It's uh... Out... side.

132
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,542
Uhh...

133
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:15,709
Uh, duh.

134
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,084
The hallway is perfectly normal!

135
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,626
In that moment,

136
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:33,334
she spoke the honest truth, from the bottom of her heart.

137
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,584
She wasn't protecting the principal,

138
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,917
nor was she too lazy to explain what had happened.

139
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,251
No, that's not the reason.

140
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:45,042
Perhaps, in the spirit of competition, she was respecting

141
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:49,834
the two brave combatants that fought for their very lives.

142
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,709
Early summer rain, pours down and flows through waters.

143
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,542
"Mogami River."

144
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,667
What's that even mean?

145
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,751
All right! Let's do this thing!

146
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,626
Mio! You can be the referee.

147
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,459
You don't need a referee for ten-yen soccer.

148
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,834
Uh-uh-uh. You don't get it!

149
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,709
You gotta set the mood! It's all about the atmosphere!

150
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,334
Now! Kick-off time!

151
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,376
Have it your way.

152
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,876
Now gimme your best shot! C'mon!

153
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,376
'Kay...

154
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:08,459
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

155
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,917
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

156
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,292
--Wha--! --Chomp!

157
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:15,251
I love him!

158
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,417
I trapped a cockroach.

159
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:45,334
He's under this cup. But what do I do now?

160
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,834
Okay. Think.

161
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,792
I have to go about this carefully.

162
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,626
I can't let this disgusting menace

163
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,792
desecrate our home any longer!

164
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:01,959
I need to come up with a plan
to keep him from tormenting us!

165
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,001
But what can I do?

166
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:07,126
The bug spray! No, that won't work!

167
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:11,292
It won't kill instantly,
so the roach might be able to run away.

168
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:12,455
And besides...

169
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:16,917
I don't want to see him flail
in the final throes of death!

170
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,042
I know! Maybe the dish soap!

171
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,834
If I spread it on the table,
it might slow the sucker down when

172
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:26,751
it's trying to escape!
And then I can go for the finishing blow!

173
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:32,292
It's jumping!

174
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,167
Animals put up the biggest fight

175
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,667
when they're cornered! So, it might leap past the soap!

176
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,167
It could even make a desperate charge right at me!

177
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:43,251
What if it touches me, or gets on me?!

178
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:45,876
No, what if it gets on my face?!

179
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,167
Or worse! What if... it jumps into my mouth?

180
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:54,209
If it does... I couldn't go on.

181
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,876
It'd be a one-shot kill!

182
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,167
This is it!

183
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:04,042
I have no other options!

184
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:07,917
Once I lift this bowl, it's on!
It's destroy or be destroyed!

185
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:10,376
Do or die!

186
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:19,834
Then again... there might be another way.

187
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:23,959
Huh? What's going on in here?

188
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,459
Hey! Sakamoto!

189
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,001
You have to help me!

190
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:31,501
There's... a roach... in... the cup!

191
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:32,959
Right here!

192
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,251
A what? Uh!

193
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,459
You want me to take care of a bug?

194
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,834
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

195
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,917
Just leave it to me. Now, let me at 'em.

196
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,751
You're my hero!

197
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:50,626
Hey.

198
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:51,792
Yeah?

199
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:53,251
What do you think you're doing?

200
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,251
Lift the cup. I got this.

201
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,001
Really?

202
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:59,001
Well, I mean, if you don't lift it,

203
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:02,959
I can't do my job. So move your hand already.

204
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:06,376
Come on!

205
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:09,084
No way! Why would I release it?

206
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,876
I can't break the seal that's
containing this minion of evil!

207
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,167
It's like Pandora's box!

208
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:15,459
If I open it, I'm gonna unleash a demon!

209
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:16,751
What are you talking about?

210
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,251
There's no way I can help you out

211
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,459
if you don't show me that bug!

212
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,917
So, lift it yourself then!

213
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,626
I don't have thumbs!

214
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:30,334
Great. Now what do I do?

215
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,751
Sakamoto got fed up and ran off.

216
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:34,167
Hey, Nano!

217
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,334
You have any yummy snacks I can eat?

218
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:39,542
Perfect timing!

219
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:42,542
She's never been bothered by bugs before, so maybe...

220
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:45,959
Hakase! I trapped a gross cockroach under this cup!

221
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:49,042
And I'd really appreciate it
if you took care of him for me!

222
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:50,834
Sure thing!

223
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,959
You're an angel!

224
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:56,834
Oh, now don't mind me. You go and do your thing.

225
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,167
All righty then!

226
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:01,751
I'll bonk the little buggy with a really good bop!

227
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,209
Bam!

228
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,251
Uh. It looks like I missed.

229
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:13,209
Here I am, in actual, genuine distress,

230
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:17,667
but she's goofing off and making jokes, at my expense!

231
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:19,001
You know!

232
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,834
I really hate you sometimes, Hakase!

233
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:27,542
She's crying?

234
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:29,292
Oh, don't give me that!

235
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:32,626
I was just kidding! You can forget what I said!

236
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,459
There's no way I could ever hate you!

237
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,959
Not in a million years!

238
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:39,876
Come on. You know I love you!

239
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,334
Nano!

240
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:52,584
Oh, Silly! I can't stay mad at you!

241
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,042
Nano!

242
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:03,501
Now! It's do or die! Let's rock!

243
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:13,126
It's getting too hot, so can I get out?

244
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,876
Get out? But you just got in a moment ago.

245
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,001
Yeah, but it's still too hot.

246
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:21,084
How about we count to ten,
and after that, you can get out.

247
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,376
Twenty log square root ten!

248
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,459
Huh?

249
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,792
That equals ten, so I can leave now?

250
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,584
Well... I meant...

251
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:32,626
One... Two... One at a time, like that!

252
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:34,501
Aww.

253
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,501
Man, this sucks.

254
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:44,459
I can't believe everyone left for cram school.

255
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:48,501
Mm? Well, I'm bored out of my mind, aren't you?

256
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:56,584
Oh yeah, weren't you supposed to be at cram school too?

257
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,042
Hm?

258
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,834
You skipped?!

259
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,584
Wow!

260
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,251
How's that curry? It smells nice!

261
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:26,417
Good! It's just about ready!

262
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:29,167
Man, it better be. I'm starving over here.

263
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,417
Tell me about it.

264
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,542
How's the fishing going, Mai?

265
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,042
I sense a big catch.

266
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,542
We're gonna eat well today!

267
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:44,292
All right! Looks like it's all done now!

268
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,417
Thanks for waiting!

269
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:53,376
Get ready for some super ultra-great delicious curry!

270
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,042
Gimme a little longer!

271
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:03,167
I should've put the rice on before we started the curry.

272
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:05,084
Oh well, as long as it's tasty,

273
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,667
it's better late than never, I guess!

274
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:08,584
You know what I mean?

275
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,792
Oh, if we brought some mayonnaise,

276
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,584
I bet that would really hit the spot.

277
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,126
Mayo does go great with curry, doesn't it?

278
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:17,834
Uh, yeah. Mayo.

279
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:18,917
Wouldn't you say so?

280
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,876
I felt sick.

281
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,001
No, no. It's not what it looks like!

282
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:33,959
It was an accident, really! I swear!

283
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,417
Wait! See, look!

284
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:38,917
We still have these noodles! They're... jelly noodles.

285
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,209
That's good, right?

286
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,084
I'll have your blood.

287
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,459
Huh? Wh-What was that?

288
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,042
Your blood!

289
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:54,084
You'll pay for it with your life! Come back!

290
00:19:58,292 --> 00:19:59,251
Uh.

291
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:02,542
Huh?

292
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,167
I'm so sorry, Mai!

293
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:11,376
We screwed up the rice and curry, so there's no lunch!

294
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,251
Are you mad at us?

295
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,834
At least we still have these noodles.

296
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:29,959
You're a life saver!

297
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,501
Be free.

298
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:45,084
So, uh. Here's our lunch.

299
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,709
One serving of jelly noodles.

300
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,501
We only brought one pack?!

301
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:51,792
I was thinking we could ration
it out evenly with each other.

302
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:55,001
But because you and I were the ones who ruined the lunch,

303
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,084
Mai gets first dibs.

304
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:03,667
Rock, paper, scissors!

305
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:04,667
Boo-yah!

306
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:05,959
You better not try anything funny

307
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,626
and eat the entire thing by yourself!

308
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:11,334
Oh, calm down. I would never do anything mean like that.

309
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:15,751
Now then, it's time for me to dig in!

310
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:27,376
Down the wrong pipe.

311
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:47,417
Grumble...

312
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:48,626
Grumble.

313
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,709
Grumble.

314
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,626
--Grumble. --Grumble.

315
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,001
I know! How 'bout we play some cards!

316
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:56,417
How 'bout not!

317
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,959
At this rate, the entire trip is gonna be a bust,

318
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,917
so we might as well try and have some fun

319
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:03,251
playing games and end on a high note!

320
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:10,834
I got it!

321
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:12,459
Oh, yeah? What'cha got?

322
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,834
I was just thinking,

323
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,167
when adults get sad and bored,

324
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,626
they like to break out the drinks!

325
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:18,751
I guess that's true!

326
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,917
Mai! Am I right, or am I right?

327
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:27,501
I came prepared. One sec.

328
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,501
Whoa, that's super hardcore.

329
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,626
Yeah, you bet I am!

330
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:34,126
Watch out! We got a badass over here!

331
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:35,542
Ta-da!

332
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,167
Ugh! I don't care!

333
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:43,251
I'm gonna chug it!

334
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:44,959
Don't do it! You'll die, I bet!

335
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:49,209
Maybe Mai can share whatever she has left!

336
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,501
Huh?

337
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:53,542
Oh, this? It's cider.

338
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:47,084
Ah!

339
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:49,751
Out from the bath, have some milk.

340
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:51,792
Pretend that you're drunk.

341
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,917
I'm Peso!

342
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,084
Ten-Yen here!

343
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,001
I'm Wado-kaichin!

344
00:24:58,084 --> 00:24:59,709
Remember! Just because you're currency,

345
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:00,834
doesn't mean you're current!

346
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,417
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 7.

347
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:06,667
Look forward to it!
