1
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:06,636
All righty! That's all the time we have.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,095
And just a reminder that the days

3
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:09,303
are starting to get shorter,

4
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:12,011
so be sure to get home before the sun sets.

5
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,678
Finally! Let's go, dude!

6
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,303
Behind you, bro!

7
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:18,845
A bunch of people seem to think plasma is the answer,

8
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:20,803
but I'm not entirely sure if they're correct.

9
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:21,928
I prefer gathering evidence...

10
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:22,553
Hey, Nano!

11
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:23,595
Ah! Yes?

12
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:25,178
Wanna walk home together?

13
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,428
We can grab a bite, too!

14
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:27,595
Whaddaya say?

15
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,636
So? Wanna?

16
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,720
Uh. Well.

17
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,886
Hey! Mio, you should come, too.

18
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,595
Well, poop. It looks like she bailed already.

19
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:38,886
Anyway.

20
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:41,761
Weird.

21
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:44,511
He was like super gross.

22
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:47,261
I ran into him at the mall when I was getting my coffee...

23
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:48,970
I can't believe I just did that.

24
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:52,428
Leaving her alone there was so thoughtless and mean.

25
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,761
Maybe if I'd introduced myself like a normal girl,

26
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:57,136
it would've been easier to hide in plain sight.

27
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,761
Uh, hi. My name's Nano Shinonome!

28
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:04,511
And, um, you see, I, uh, I was on my way to school

29
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:05,803
and then I...

30
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:54,053
I heard the local coffee shop got remodeled recently,

31
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:56,345
so I went over to take a peek.

32
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,886
Uh, miss?

33
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:04,095
Are you ready to order?

34
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:13,803
Just the espresso. The "T" one.

35
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,386
Um, so, uh,

36
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,386
you would like one espresso in a tall, is that correct?

37
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:26,636
Wait, in a what? "Tall"?

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,678
That's what "T" stands for?

39
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:32,678
You know what, that T espresso thing sounds pretty good

40
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:34,970
in a tall.

41
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:36,345
So, yeah, uh.

42
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:40,345
Lemme get the T espresso... in a small size?

43
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:44,261
You wanna order the short espresso instead of the tall?

44
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:52,845
Uh-huh.

45
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,345
I'll take it in a small short!

46
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:56,928
That's the one I want!

47
00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:00,595
Um. Sure. So with the espresso order-- Uh!

48
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:05,386
It, uh-- You can get it served either hot or cold.

49
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,511
Hot please!

50
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,345
Okay then.

51
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,511
I'll whip that up for you right away.

52
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:13,511
For size...

53
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:18,595
...it varies.

54
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,720
You can get a solo or doppio.

55
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,470
D-D-Doppi-what? Doppio?

56
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:25,803
What the heck is a doppio? Is that even a real word?

57
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:27,595
How am I supposed to know what that means?

58
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:31,095
Does it even say it anywhere? What is doppio?

59
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:36,053
Actually, scratch that, I changed my mind.

60
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:37,470
I'm just gonna get today's special--

61
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:40,053
whatever that drink happens to be.

62
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:41,636
Well, uh.

63
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:48,053
For today, the special is also the espresso.

64
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:52,345
Fine then. That one.

65
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:53,261
Right.

66
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:55,928
Would that be a solo...

67
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,386
...or a doppio for this order?

68
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,261
Or a doppio? Or a doppio? Or a doppio for this order?

69
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:17,220
Sure.

70
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:19,095
I'll take it.

71
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:20,470
Huh?

72
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,428
I mean, uh...

73
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,261
Just gimme whatever feels right in your heart.

74
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:31,178
Coming right up then.

75
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,553
Thank you for waiting.

76
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,803
Here's your solo espresso.

77
00:05:57,761 --> 00:06:00,678
It's so tiny.

78
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:13,636
And so bitter!

79
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:20,553
Thank you! Please come again!

80
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,720
Welp, I have no choice.

81
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:33,220
It's vending machines for life.

82
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:35,636
They'll never judge me.

83
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:43,053
For my dear grandson's birthday,

84
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,428
I bought him a brand new baseball glove.

85
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:48,136
Grandpa! Here it comes!

86
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,761
Try your best, my boy!

87
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:52,636
You're pretty far away, so give it all you've got!

88
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,970
Ah, the young people.

89
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:56,678
Always so full of excitement and dreams.

90
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:59,053
You ready?!

91
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,636
Ready as I'll ever be.

92
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,636
Now throw it as hard as you can!

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,470
This is the perfect opportunity to show him

94
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:06,678
how cool his grandpa can be.

95
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:13,845
Curveball.

96
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,553
Uh, 'scuse me.

97
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,886
Yes?

98
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,720
Can I get one of these Agonizing Super-Hot Chef's

99
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:23,303
Fanciful Chicken Bars on a stick please?

100
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:28,053
Seriously? You actually want one of those things?

101
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:44,345
What's the matter, Koujirou?

102
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:47,470
Oh, yeah. I gotta hurry before the post offices clo--

103
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:48,053
Mio!

104
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,261
Oh, it's you. What up?

105
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,803
I was lookin' for ya.

106
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:55,470
You kinda booked it as soon as homeroom was over, y'know?

107
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:57,261
Yeah. I guess I did.

108
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:58,595
Well, it doesn't matter.

109
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,095
Now that we're here, why don't we walk home t--?

110
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:01,428
I gotta do something.

111
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:02,845
Really? What?

112
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:05,261
It's, uh... It's kinda hard to explain.

113
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:06,928
Ah, come on! It can't be that hard.

114
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:08,553
You should at least try.

115
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:10,845
Uh, I just have, um, a thing!

116
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:12,053
What kind of thing? Is it a--?

117
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:13,678
Excuse me a moment.

118
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:20,428
You're a...

119
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:21,345
I didn't do it!

120
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:24,303
Wait, what? He didn't ask anything!

121
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:26,595
Uh! That was just a weird reflex.

122
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:30,095
I didn't mean to catch you off guard.

123
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:32,095
And relax, you're not in any trouble.

124
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,428
That's good.

125
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:35,423
Is there something we can help you with, officer?

126
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:36,557
Yes, actually.

127
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,970
Some counterfeit bills have been
used in these vending machines.

128
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:40,053
I was wondering if you've seen

129
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:42,261
any suspicious activity in the area.

130
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:43,803
I haven't seen any.

131
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:46,428
Me neither, but I don't pass by here that often.

132
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:49,345
Based on an eyewitness report, there was a shady person

133
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,011
carrying a beige tote with red stripes.

134
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,053
Hm.

135
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:54,720
Nah. There's no way that you could--

136
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,303
Wait.

137
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:58,970
Why is she actually making that weird, kinda gross face?

138
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:02,178
Did she actually do it? Is she the culprit?

139
00:09:02,261 --> 00:09:04,595
No way. She would never do that.

140
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,845
Mio. Quit joking around already.

141
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:09,595
Is she squealing on herself?

142
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,553
She'd never survive in the slammer!

143
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:12,720
Wait a second.

144
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,636
You aren't the one that did it, are you?

145
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,053
That's crazy talk!

146
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:17,470
She's just super into volleyball

147
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:20,678
and is practicing her bumping form or whatever.

148
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,720
Isn't that right?

149
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:24,053
Okay then.

150
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,303
If it's all right with you two,

151
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:27,636
I'd like to check inside your bags just in case.

152
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,303
Of course! Go ahead!

153
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:30,928
Hear that? We--

154
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:33,470
She whipped it out!

155
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,928
She has a real fake bill!

156
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:40,761
It's all over now! I can't believe my friend's a criminal!

157
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:44,261
Take this... and please look the other way.

158
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:47,970
Take the money! And let me go!

159
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,845
Is this one of your counterfeit bills?

160
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:52,386
No, that's real cash! And it's also a bribe!

161
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,928
That's quite suspicious!

162
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,970
Now show me what's in your bag!
And stop resisting the law!

163
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:59,386
This bag isn't mine! I swear!

164
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,428
I've never seen it in my life!

165
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,470
You fool.

166
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:27,720
One, two!

167
00:10:27,803 --> 00:10:29,386
Three! Four!

168
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,261
Five!

169
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:32,595
Where's six?

170
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:35,678
Passion.

171
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,845
Huh?

172
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:35,928
A fever? Silly.

173
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:41,595
Hm?

174
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:45,095
What? Huh?

175
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:46,261
Wait!

176
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:49,136
Oh, there you are. Don't run off like that.

177
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,261
It's like you're a newborn.

178
00:11:56,011 --> 00:11:59,053
Mio! Are you gonna come and eat?

179
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,970
Food's getting cold!

180
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,220
Hey, Mio! Say something!

181
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,886
"The Life of Koujirou"! Check him out!

182
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,220
Hm?

183
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,095
What are you chewing--? Ah!

184
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,928
There's the bell!

185
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:36,595
Classes are done for today!

186
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:38,386
Don't forget that midterms are coming up,

187
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,970
so be sure to study hard.

188
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:42,553
The test's subjects are on the
board if you need a reminder.

189
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:49,928
Goodbye!

190
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:53,220
Nano always books it outta here as soon as she can.

191
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:54,553
Hmm.

192
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:04,053
--See ya! --See you tomorrow.

193
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:05,011
Have a good day!

194
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:06,720
You as well.

195
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:08,636
When I don't know something,

196
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,886
I just pretend that I do.

197
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,761
♪ Cha-cha-la-la! Cha! ♪

198
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:16,845
♪ Cha-cha-la-la! Cha! ♪

199
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:20,970
♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha Cha-la-la! ♪

200
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:31,720
Uh.

201
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:33,720
Yuuko, can I borrow an eraser?

202
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,761
You may!

203
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:36,720
Which hand?

204
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:38,595
Uhh...

205
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:40,761
Hey, Mai, do you have an eraser?

206
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:42,511
I do. Here.

207
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:43,886
A character eraser?

208
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,803
Man, this isn't gonna work.

209
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:48,761
These just smudge everything.

210
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:50,678
Yuuko, lend me your eraser.

211
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:52,553
This is really all you had on you?

212
00:13:52,636 --> 00:13:54,970
Wouldja look at that?

213
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:56,886
'Kay, which hand?

214
00:13:58,303 --> 00:13:59,428
This one.

215
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:00,928
Whoa! Wait a sec! That's cheating!

216
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:03,095
The rules clearly state you have to pick one at a time.

217
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:05,011
You mean the rules you just made up?

218
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,178
Mai, you first.

219
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:09,761
Go right ahead. You can zoom in as much as you'd like!

220
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:13,428
Ah! Zoom out! Zoom out!

221
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,761
What the heck?! You're not allowed to attack the hand!

222
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,303
That'll be a strike for you, Mai.

223
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:18,803
And that means?

224
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:20,178
It's a penalty. Duh.

225
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:22,970
And so what happens when you get a penalty?

226
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:24,261
Uhh...

227
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:26,136
You gotta treat me to 23 juices!

228
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,053
You're still hung up on that?

229
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:33,095
Are ya hungry, Yuuko? Have a snack!

230
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:36,886
Ready... kan-ji-zai-bo-sa-gyyo-

231
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,845
jin-han-nya-ha-ra- mi-ta-ji-sho-kei-go.

232
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:41,178
There! Did it!

233
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:42,470
Man, that was a close one!

234
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:44,803
It's not sho-kei-go, it's sho-ken-go.

235
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:47,011
And you were this close to falling for it.

236
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,011
Yeah? Two strikes for you!

237
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,803
Rock-paper-scissors!

238
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:52,303
Heh. Ha!

239
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,636
Like I would play with the hand that has the eraser in it.

240
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,511
This one.

241
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,886
<i>Dios mio</i> ! I fell for it!

242
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,220
Hand it over. We won fair and square.

243
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:01,886
Yeah, all right, fine.

244
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,845
Here. Your prize.

245
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:05,220
More character erasers?

246
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:09,178
Thank you! Please come again!

247
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:11,386
Why are there so many character erasers?

248
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,886
Tell me about it. Oh. Isn't that Nano?

249
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,178
Yeah, it is!

250
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,636
She's definitely, probably, maybe a robot.

251
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,970
Would you cut that out already?
It really bothers her, y'know?

252
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:27,845
Why would it bother her?

253
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,095
Robots are legit!

254
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,636
Gah.

255
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:52,970
Hey.

256
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:56,720
Wanna run for it?

257
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,386
What? C'mon, Dad. I don't get it.

258
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,511
Why do you want me to wear this thing in public?

259
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:08,220
It's like embarrassing!

260
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:09,720
Ya think so, huh?

261
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:14,511
Well then... you're just a spineless, mugwort dumpling!

262
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:32,761
Let's see. Which one is Shinonome?

263
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,136
Ah! This one!

264
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,845
Wait. Shinonome Lab?

265
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:41,678
Oh! I guess a lab makes sense!

266
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,720
That's awesome!

267
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:50,053
'Scuse me! Anybody home?

268
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,845
Huh. No answer.

269
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,970
Coming! Be right there!

270
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:56,386
So sorry to keep you--

271
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,428
Wha--?

272
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:59,386
Oh, no! How did this happen?

273
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,511
What am I gonna do?

274
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,886
Why did she show up at our front door?

275
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,303
If she somehow gets the chance to meet Hakase,

276
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:07,303
then my secret'll be out for sure!

277
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:09,886
Hmm. How should I handle this?

278
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,183
Wait. Hang on.

279
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,178
Maybe she's just here to give me
a print-out I forgot at school.

280
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:16,970
That would explain why she came all the way out here.

281
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:18,136
So, this is the hall.

282
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,136
Thank you for the grand tour!

283
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,761
No!

284
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:29,803
She's already made herself at home.

285
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:31,261
I'll just have to find out what she wants

286
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:33,095
before Hakase says anything crazy.

287
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,595
Ugh. I'm starving.

288
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,303
I'm starving. I'm starving.

289
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:37,803
Hm?

290
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:39,470
Hey! Who was that?

291
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:41,553
It was Sakamoto, our talking cat!

292
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:43,011
Hakase!

293
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,220
For real?

294
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,595
No! Don't be silly! Of course he isn't!

295
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:49,928
Hey! Meow for me! Now! Do it right meow! Please?

296
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:51,511
Huh? Why do I have to--?

297
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:53,261
Please, Sakamoto!

298
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:54,886
Uh. Meow.

299
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,845
See? He's a normal cat!

300
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,220
Uh. Mh-hm.

301
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:00,095
All right, kitty, we have a guest here today,

302
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,386
so why don't you go and play outside, 'kay?

303
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,553
You're kicking me out of--?

304
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:05,803
Fine!

305
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,595
Meow.

306
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:15,803
I haven't introduced myself to you yet, huh?

307
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,303
I'm Yuuko Aioi!

308
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,761
So, are you Nano's little sister or something?

309
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,553
I'm not a sister. I'm Hakase!

310
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:22,803
Oh, and I built Nano!

311
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,970
You built her?

312
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:27,970
Awesome! Small and smart!

313
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:30,761
I'm just your run-of-the-mill kid genius.

314
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,845
Wait, no! She's just messing around with you!

315
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,511
I actually have some relatives that live nearby,

316
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:36,011
but they work all the time,

317
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,303
so they drop their daughter off here so I can watch her!

318
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:39,053
She's here so often, it's like a second home!

319
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:41,178
Right? Isn't that right? Huh? Huh?

320
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:42,220
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?

321
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,261
Would you take a hint?!

322
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:48,970
Uh, please excuse me! I'll go make some more tea!

323
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,803
Ah! No need! I got it!

324
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:52,428
Well, more like, you got it.

325
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:54,886
Huh?

326
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,220
There you go!

327
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:03,011
That is the coolest ever!

328
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,470
And the other hand is a gun.

329
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:10,011
There's more? That's even cooler!

330
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:12,470
My life is over.

331
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:17,470
And next up, we're gonna say a buncha random cool things!

332
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:18,970
Yay!

333
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:22,303
Our first contestant is yours truly!

334
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:25,386
Hey. Open your eyes. Wake up.

335
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,136
Don't you die on me!

336
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,553
Wow. Now that's a cool scene!

337
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,095
Now, Hakase!

338
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:31,970
Me!

339
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:33,470
Rhinoceros Beetle!

340
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:34,970
That's cool!

341
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:37,970
So... why did she come over anyway?

342
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,261
They're on top of each other!

343
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,178
I give! I give!

344
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:42,428
You're so tiny!

345
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:44,720
It's too big!

346
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:45,928
'Kay. I'mma go.

347
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,928
She came for nothing?

348
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:55,678
Thanks for having me over.

349
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,428
Sorry I stayed so late.

350
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:59,511
Uh. No problem.

351
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:01,803
And, um, I wanted to say.

352
00:20:01,886 --> 00:20:03,053
Yeah?

353
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,136
Truth is, I've actually been practicing

354
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,511
some magic tricks lately!

355
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,386
So I'm not a robot, or anything, I swear!

356
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,053
Yeah, I already knew that.

357
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:11,720
You're Nano. And that's good enough for me!

358
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:13,553
There we go.

359
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:15,803
As long as you're happy with who you are,

360
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:18,345
that's all that matters.

361
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:20,761
I just wanted to stop by here and tell you that.

362
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,595
But I got distracted.

363
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:28,386
See you at school, Nano!

364
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,386
Uh. Yeah.

365
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:41,178
Hey!

366
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:42,428
Hm?

367
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,636
Uh.

368
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:49,011
Come by at any time.

369
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:50,845
Sure! Sounds fun!

370
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:53,678
Really? Hooray!

371
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:56,470
I gotcha! How 'bout we doodle next time?

372
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,386
Yeah! We can draw sharks and stuff!

373
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,220
Oh, I like that! Sharks are cool!

374
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:02,303
They sure are! They're the best!

375
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,136
You really like those sharks, don'tcha, Hakase?

376
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,136
Not like! I love sharks!

377
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,053
They're the coolest!

378
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,428
Rawr! I'mma shark!

379
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:11,678
Do more! Do more shark things!

380
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:13,845
Rawr! Shark attack! Rawr!

381
00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:14,886
Again! Again!

382
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:18,845
Hakase! I wanna play!

383
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:20,595
Look out! I'm gonna thrash!

384
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:21,636
--So cool! --Oh, no!

385
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,886
Me shark! Me hungry!

386
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:00,845
Hi, Sakamoto!

387
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:02,470
'Kay, bye!

388
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,761
See ya.

389
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:20,178
Huh, bizarre.

390
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:28,970
It's me, the screw!

391
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:31,178
I have a Phillip's head, so that's a plus!

392
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:33,220
I also give off plenty of positive vibes,

393
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:35,553
so I'm sure that adds lots to my character!

394
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:38,845
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 17.

395
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:40,345
Look forward to it!
