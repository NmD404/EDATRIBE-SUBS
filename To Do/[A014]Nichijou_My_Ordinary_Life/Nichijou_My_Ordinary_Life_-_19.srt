1
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:11,846
Hellvetica Standard.

2
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,512
My glasses, my glasses, my glasses, my glasses.

3
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:28,679
My glasses, my glasses, my glasses.

4
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:34,887
My glasses, my glasses, my glasses!

5
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:37,762
My glasses!

6
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:43,721
My glasses, my glasses, my glasses, my glasses, my glasses!

7
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,929
Glasses, glasses, glasses, glasses, glasses,

8
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,096
glasses, glasses, glasses, glasses!

9
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:37,471
I'm feeling crazy,

10
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:39,137
so watch closely as I do something

11
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:42,512
you've never seen me do and may never see me do again!

12
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:50,637
I am a victim of domestic violence!

13
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:59,554
Well? Did I blow your minds?

14
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,762
And what are we supposed to say to that?

15
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:06,512
Seems like something you'd do.

16
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:07,429
Yeah, I think you would've

17
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:08,804
done that at some point.

18
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,679
Uh-huh, it was definitely a "you" thing.

19
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:13,012
Well, then the next thing I do will be totally "un-me"

20
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:15,054
and completely out of character!

21
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,429
I tripped and fell!

22
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:31,596
That is so something she would do.

23
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,637
Yup. Seems about right.

24
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,096
<i>Daifuku</i> !

25
00:03:57,179 --> 00:04:00,096
Come and get your <i>daifuku</i> here!

26
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,887
Sorry, but...

27
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:04,804
...could you wear this instead? It's more appropriate.

28
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:06,471
Come one, come all!

29
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:08,804
And get some sweet, sweet <i>daifuku</i> !

30
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:10,137
Sorry again.

31
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:12,804
Could you try doing this without talking?

32
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:13,929
They said it was on sale,

33
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:15,929
but the price was higher than before!

34
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:23,846
Do you think you could maybe put on a shirt or something?

35
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:29,304
Are you sulking now?

36
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:34,721
You're not sulking?

37
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:36,929
Well, then what's the problem?

38
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:53,637
Um...

39
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:57,137
You can use your words to talk
to me if you really need to.

40
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:33,221
Here I come!

41
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,554
--Yes! --I don't think so!

42
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,554
But I jumped on the mat without touching the bar, so...

43
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:02,971
Yeah, you made it past the bar.

44
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:04,429
By going under it!

45
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,096
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

46
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,596
You have to get over the bar!

47
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:08,637
Sorry.

48
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:11,179
I'll do it right this time, I swear.

49
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:13,596
Here, I'll lower it to make things easier.

50
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,929
Take it nice and slow.

51
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,387
And remember the jumping form I taught you before.

52
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:18,596
Okay!

53
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,971
This is it.

54
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:21,429
I've gotta at least be able to make it over the bar

55
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:24,054
when it's that freakin' low.

56
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:28,929
If I can't even pull this off, everyone'll laugh at me!

57
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,596
Did I do it?

58
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:39,846
You ding-dong!

59
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:41,512
Why can't you do the "thing" like I taught you?

60
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:43,471
Do you just not get it?

61
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:47,387
Well, I can see me doing a proper Fosbury flop in my head.

62
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:50,137
Oh, you're flopping all right.

63
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:53,804
What you're doing is more like a Fosbury... torpedo!

64
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:57,679
A human... torpedo.

65
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:59,387
I wouldn't put it like that!

66
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:01,512
No, wait.

67
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:05,304
Actually... I think I just did.

68
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:07,262
I'm not that bad, come on!

69
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:08,346
Quit joking!

70
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,679
But you are that bad!

71
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:12,846
Sorry.

72
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:14,262
Hey, don't apologize.

73
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:16,512
I'll be right here to help you out until you get it.

74
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:19,887
You're the one who's always helping me out

75
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:20,887
with my homework.

76
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:23,387
And now it's my turn to help you!

77
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:25,762
I'm gonna stay by your side, no matter what!

78
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:29,429
Try not to psych yourself out!

79
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:32,179
Just relax a bit and take your time with it, okay?

80
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:33,846
You totally got this thing!

81
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,304
I believe in you, Mio!

82
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:40,929
I've always been bad at sports,

83
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,679
for as long as I can remember.

84
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,596
I hate to break it to you, Mio,

85
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,637
but you're playing the wrong kind of football right now!

86
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:51,346
I can be just as athletic as anyone else.

87
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,929
But, whenever I have to follow any rules,

88
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:56,137
everything falls apart!

89
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:57,596
Get ready!

90
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:58,762
And... fall!

91
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,137
You're supposed to fall backwards on your back!

92
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:05,429
But... that doesn't mean I can't change.

93
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:06,929
I can be better!

94
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,429
I just have to try!

95
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:12,179
One, two...

96
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:14,054
There! Huh?

97
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:16,721
Mio, you are literally spinning out of control!

98
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:18,846
I don't care how long it takes.

99
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:21,096
I don't care if I keep failing!

100
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,346
At least there's one thing I know I can do.

101
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,887
I'll never give up!

102
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,512
One, two, three!

103
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,887
Well, almost.

104
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:44,387
Let's try it one more time.

105
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:46,387
Yuuko believes in me.

106
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:48,304
I think I'm gonna take a quick breather, 'kay?

107
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:49,971
Sure, go ahead.

108
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,762
So, I can believe in me!

109
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,554
I'll give it everything I've got!

110
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:02,179
I won't quit!

111
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:09,262
I can be better if I keep on trying!

112
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:13,762
Great effort can take you to even greater heights.

113
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:05,304
And thus, the "Torpedo Flop" was born.

114
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:19,137
The Life of White Tigers!

115
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:20,471
Check 'em out!

116
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:25,179
Like... All they do is sleep.

117
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:26,304
And that one in the front

118
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:28,054
is giving us a good view of its butt.

119
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:29,304
Sure is.

120
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:30,512
They aren't really doing anything,

121
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,096
so there's not much else to look at.

122
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,262
And after all the effort we made to come out! Rude.

123
00:10:34,346 --> 00:10:36,221
I'm just glad we got to see them.

124
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:37,596
Yeah.

125
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,846
Huh?

126
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:55,804
Wow!

127
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:27,304
It's raining!

128
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,429
I gotta go bring in the laundry!

129
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,971
Hey! That's the wrong way!

130
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:34,846
Huh?

131
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:48,846
There!

132
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:53,929
Yay!

133
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,721
Uh--

134
00:11:56,804 --> 00:11:58,012
Looks like it's wet already.

135
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,137
You should still bring it in!

136
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:06,221
Hakase, Sakamoto, I'm home!

137
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:07,846
It started pouring out of nowhere,

138
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,471
so I hope you were able to get the laundry

139
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,346
before it got too wet.

140
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:18,179
It's not my fault! Sakamoto told me to bring it in!

141
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:20,179
I'm tellin' ya!

142
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:21,554
It was all the kitty's idea.

143
00:12:21,637 --> 00:12:23,637
He was the one that made me do it!

144
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:26,637
So what you're saying is,

145
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:28,179
you knocked the laundry over

146
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:30,554
while Sakamoto was making you bring it in?

147
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:33,804
No, he specifically told me to take the clothes and just--

148
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,179
throw them all on the ground.

149
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:36,429
I did not!

150
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:37,804
Way to blindside me.

151
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,637
Don't blame someone else for your messes, kid!

152
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:41,179
But you said to!

153
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,637
I never told you to throw things on the ground!

154
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,262
--Did, too! --I did not!

155
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,012
--Did, too! --I did not!

156
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:47,679
--Did, too! --I did not!

157
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:49,262
--Did, too! --I did not!

158
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:50,679
--Did, too! --I did not!

159
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:52,137
I wish you weren't a liar!

160
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:54,137
I'm what?!

161
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,512
Nano.

162
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:58,137
Why don't we just blame this whole thing on Sakamoto?

163
00:12:58,221 --> 00:12:59,137
That okay?

164
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:00,346
That is not okay, brat!

165
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:01,601
No big deal.

166
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:04,554
I just gotta wash that laundry
again and it'll be good as new.

167
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:08,304
Oh! Good point!

168
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,762
Guess that's true.

169
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:11,929
But, I'll never get the time I spend on it back.

170
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:15,512
As punishment, neither of you
will be getting dinner tonight.

171
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:16,804
Aww.

172
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:18,137
Dammit. I didn't do anything wrong!

173
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:20,054
But it was only Sakamoto's fault!

174
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,637
See? He said so himself!

175
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:23,971
He confessed! So you can blame him!

176
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,137
All right, then.

177
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:28,887
Since he owned up to his mistakes,

178
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:30,846
the only one that doesn't get dinner is you.

179
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:34,304
Wait! I wanna take some of the blame!

180
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,762
And I can own up to my mistakes, too!

181
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,137
Like how I was the one who tried to

182
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:38,679
bring in the laundry in the first place

183
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:42,221
and accidentally knocked it over and got it all wet--

184
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,846
Ta-da!

185
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:48,179
We'll be having special rice omelets for dinner!

186
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,554
Wow!

187
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:51,137
The eggs were on sale today!

188
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,554
Wait. I thought I wasn't allowed to have dinner.

189
00:13:53,637 --> 00:13:55,596
Yeah, you're right!

190
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,887
I completely forgot about that!

191
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:02,596
Well, um... then...

192
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,262
I guess I can let you have the rice omelette for tonight!

193
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,762
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

194
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,221
--But tomorrow, you get nothing!
--Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

195
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:11,846
♪ Swim, swim! ♪

196
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:13,846

00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:15,929

199
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:43,679
Mio! Mai! <i>Selamat pagi</i> !

200
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:45,637
Man, wasn't that clay self-portrait assignment

201
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:47,012
a huge pain in the butt?

202
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,429
Wait, that project was due today?

203
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:51,471
Look at that! The great, all-knowing Mio

204
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,679
finally forgot about her homework for once!

205
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,846
Ugh! I thought it was due tomorrow!

206
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,346
Mai, did you do your self-portrait?

207
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:02,762
Ah, dang it.

208
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,429
So, even Mai forgot about it!

209
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:07,596
You don't see that every day!

210
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,762
Can you not laugh at this disaster?

211
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:12,596
But I guess you can say that when it rains,

212
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,929
it pours.

213
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:22,179
It really...

214
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:24,054
...started pouring.

215
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:46,804
Why you little!

216
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:49,887
What the hell have you three done to my temple?

217
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,721
You must be thieves!

218
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:56,887
Well, not on my watch!

219
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,804
That was too close!

220
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:12,221
This must be a curse!

221
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:15,679
You brought evil spirits to this place!

222
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:22,054
Just get out of here.

223
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:25,096
Leave this temple now!

224
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:33,346
"We should probably go,"

225
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,512
is what the three girls thought,

226
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,887
while being pelted by the late autumn rain.

227
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,971
I'm beggin' you, Pres!

228
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:21,054
I'm about to have a match with Mr. Takasaki

229
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:23,387
and we need to find someone to be the referee!

230
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:25,429
Referee for a Go+Soccer match?

231
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:27,346
That's right. And if I can beat him,

232
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:31,054
Mr. Takasaki said that he would become the club's advisor.

233
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:32,679
I'll win. Trust me!

234
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,471
But how am I supposed to know what to do?

235
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:35,804
Don't worry.

236
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:38,471
Just read through that rulebook I let you borrow.

237
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:41,596
As long as you do that, then everything is gonna be fine!

238
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:45,554
I have no idea what's going on!

239
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:47,262
Well, I didn't even open the rulebook,

240
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:49,054
so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

241
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:49,971
But still!

242
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:51,096
What are they doing?

243
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,471
Is this Go+Soccer?

244
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:55,679
You wouldn't get it, even if you read the rulebook.

245
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:58,012
Ogi!

246
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,346
They're using forbidden techniques

247
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,346
most advanced players don't know!

248
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,429
They've reached a level that defies all theory!

249
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:06,512
Observe his stance with the outstretched arm,

250
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:08,929
and how it represents the left leg of a Go table.

251
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:11,887
In contrast, his opponent's stance is the stones.

252
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:13,762
While it seems simple at a glance,

253
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:15,512
notice the ball between his feet.

254
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:18,512
It's just a guess, but I think they're trying...

255
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:21,596
...to achieve the brilliance of the sun!

256
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:24,387
Where'd he get all that?

257
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:26,262
Now I'm even more confused!

258
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:28,262
It begins!

259
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:34,096
Oh, no!

260
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:35,846
And, Beloved!

261
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,346
Hey, Ogi?

262
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,429
What does that even mean?

263
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:43,429
Be quiet.

264
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:44,846
Can't you feel it?

265
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:47,304
The intensity between these two?

266
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,512
If they're not careful...

267
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:50,554
...someone could die.

268
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:53,596
Wait, what?

269
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,679
How would that even happen?

270
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,429
I haven't seen such high-level play in some time.

271
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,346
It's quite impressive.

272
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:04,179
No wonder the air feels so restless right now.

273
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:06,012
Is that--? This stance.

274
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:07,179
It can't be!

275
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:08,929
Unleashing that move in a friendly match?

276
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:10,387
He's completely insane!

277
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:12,179
I have no choice.

278
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:14,887
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

279
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:17,887
Father, the fated day has arrived.

280
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,929
In the name of all that is just,

281
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:28,262
shed thy light and become a star!

282
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:31,554
Ogi Forbidden Referee School! Secret Technique!

283
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:35,804
Ogi Star!

284
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:50,762
This is it!

285
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:53,512
A final love for all!

286
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,846
You're pretty good.

287
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:04,554
Hey, thanks. You, too.

288
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,971
What the heck?

289
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:13,679
I kinda just started this little club on a whim.

290
00:21:13,762 --> 00:21:15,637
But now...

291
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:18,554
...it's gotten crazier than I could've imagined!

292
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:11,346
Huh?

293
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:17,179
Huh?

294
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:23,596
I break down when no one can see me.

295
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:29,096
Step on me all you'd like, but I'll never break!

296
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,846
That's right, it's me, Clay!

297
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,512
I can be molded into anything!

298
00:23:32,596 --> 00:23:33,846
But today, I shall take the form

299
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:35,512
best suited to battle the children!

300
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:38,429
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 20!

301
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:41,054
All right, kids, bring it on!
