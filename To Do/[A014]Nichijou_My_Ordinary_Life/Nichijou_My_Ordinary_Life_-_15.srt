1
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:05,754
I bet she's a total master at mental math!

2
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:06,795
Who's a what now?

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,295
Nano, the transfer student.

4
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:10,337
Hm?

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,087
A robot like her would have a calculator function

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,337
or something, right?

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,879
What're you talkin' about?

8
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:19,879
There's no way that she's a robot.

9
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:21,087
Come on, it's so obvious

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,795
with that thing sticking out of her!

11
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,170
Huh? The key in her back is your only piece of evidence?

12
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:29,254
You're jumping to conclusions.

13
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:31,212
Hang on! Just hear me out on this one.

14
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:33,045
If she is a robot...

15
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:35,045
...that'd be dope!

16
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,087
And it'd also be off the chain!

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,754
I have no idea what that means, but you're sure excited.

18
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:41,670
I think I'm gonna officially start investigating

19
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,629
to see if Nano is a for-real robot.

20
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,795
Hold on! Isn't that going too far?

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,129
It's no prob!

22
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:49,504
I've come up with a foolproof plan!

23
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:21,087
Oh, Nano?

24
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:22,837
Yes?

25
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:25,254
Question for ya.

26
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:25,867
Hm?

27
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:30,670
What's 3,260 plus 260, then divided by 320?

28
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:37,879
Well, uh, if I were to follow
the order of operations, uh...

29
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,670
It sure is a thinker.

30
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:42,295
Maybe you should calculate this one.

31
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,587
You're kidding me! That was your big idea?

32
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,545
That's a toughie.

33
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,462
If you don't mind, I'd like to use something special.

34
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,712
A bite!

35
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:54,337
The line snapped!

36
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,920
'Kay, first things first.

37
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:58,379
I'll need to start by wiping the slate completely clean.

38
00:02:58,462 --> 00:02:59,629
She's legit using it!

39
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,629
Here goes. One, two, three.

40
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:04,795
She's like... like a...

41
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,920
...like a... She's a like, a total newb!

42
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:10,837
All right, take 3,260 and...

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,879
What happened to using the abacus?

44
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,587
Wha--?! Hey, pull it together!

45
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,295
What happened to her?

46
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,337
How you holdin' up?

47
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,670
Don't worry 'bout me.

48
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:23,337
I just crumbled under the weight of my ambitions.

49
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,670
I told you right from the get-go

50
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:27,795
that she wasn't a robot girl, didn't I?

51
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,004
Any way I can help? I could offer you a drink?

52
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:41,420
This is it! It's the sacred chalice!

53
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:46,920
Could it be? Show me the oil!

54
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,004
What a soup-prise!

55
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:51,837
Yuuko!

56
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,712
Oh, guess not. Huh?

57
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:57,129
Hey there.

58
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:00,754
Here.

59
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:06,462
She threw a fastball!

60
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:07,879
Oil?

61
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,629
For you.

62
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:11,420
Oh! That's so nice.

63
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:13,962
I appreciate the gesture.

64
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:18,170
Strike!

65
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:20,087
You can have this, too.

66
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:29,879
Curveball!

67
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:31,754
A monkey wrench?!

68
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:34,504
Wow, thanks a bunch. I needed one of these.

69
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:35,420
To eat?

70
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:36,337
Another strike!

71
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:42,212
All right, you two.

72
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,837
I think now's a good time to chill the heck out.

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,004
Can't you see that she's uncomfortable?

74
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,587
It's skinship.

75
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,129
Yeah, we just wanted to be friends with you.

76
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,212
Seriously?

77
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:54,420
There's no way she'll be your friend

78
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,920
if you keep freaking her out like that!

79
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:57,962
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:58,045 --> 00:04:59,629
That's better.

81
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:02,129
Hey! I'm not bothered, so don't worry.

82
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,712
Huh? You sure?

83
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,962
Oh. That's right! The soup!

84
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:07,795
I'll help myself if no one else wants it.

85
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,212
Would you look at that?

86
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:10,379
I guess things are all good then!

87
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:11,254
She's obviously...

88
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,545
Did I lose a tooth?

89
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,254
If you try putting yourself in her shoes,

90
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:15,837
how would you feel?

91
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:23,587
Cut it out already.

92
00:05:54,212 --> 00:05:56,170
I need to know.

93
00:05:56,254 --> 00:06:00,129
How did such a highly advanced technology come to be?

94
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,379
That transfer student who just started here

95
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,379
has a strange demeanor.

96
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:06,962
In addition to that bizarre key.

97
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:09,837
Well, no matter how you slice it,

98
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,129
she absolutely has to be a robot.

99
00:06:13,212 --> 00:06:16,962
Why was such an innovative
piece of tech being kept secret?

100
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,629
And why is she attending our plain little high school,

101
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,004
of all places?

102
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:24,254
I want to know. I need to know.

103
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:26,087
For science.

104
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,420
Once I do, that robot will be mine.

105
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:35,087
Oh!

106
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,337
Pardon the intrusion, but I brought the textbooks

107
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,379
you asked me to get, Ms. Nakamura.

108
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:40,504
She came!

109
00:06:40,587 --> 00:06:42,920
Now I must act, posthaste!

110
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:45,629
All done! If you'll excuse me, I'll be going.

111
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:47,545
One moment, Miss Shinonome!

112
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,004
So, uh, would you like a cup of coffee before you go?

113
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,670
Huh? No! I would hate to be a bother!

114
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:55,879
Oh, come on. Don't be such a stick in the mud.

115
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:58,129
You can think of this as a "thank you."

116
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:00,295
Here, I just brewed a fresh beaker.

117
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,045
Get it while it's hot.

118
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,045
One cup won't hurt me.

119
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:07,337
Let's see what happens

120
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,045
if I add a little something to calm her down.

121
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:09,879
Way down.

122
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,295
For science, of course.

123
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,462
If there are no results,

124
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,545
I'll resort to my trusty Mr. Short Circuit.

125
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,962
Again, for science.

126
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,295
Here ya go.

127
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,045
Thanks so much. It smells really good!

128
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,629
Why'd I drink it?

129
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,712
Fight it.

130
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:46,545
Hang in there!

131
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:52,879
Well, uh, I'm gonna head out now.

132
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:55,879
Wait, come back.

133
00:07:55,962 --> 00:08:01,254
I need to study you... for science.

134
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,337
Hey. Did ya hear?

135
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,212
Ms. Nakamura the science teacher passed out.

136
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:10,420
Oh, wow, she sure does that a lot, doesn't she?

137
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,379
Rawr! Rawr!

138
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:23,629
Today was pretty stressful.

139
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,754
There were one too many close calls,

140
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:28,837
but my classmates seem really nice.

141
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,462
I hope we can all be friends someday.

142
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,254
Take this!

143
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,712
Rocket punch!

144
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,379
Ka-boom!

145
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:43,004
Taste my robot's maximum power!

146
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:50,920
Ha-ha!

147
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,420
Hakase! Hakase!

148
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:58,212
Ah, Nano! Good to have you back!

149
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:00,504
Ah, Nano! Good to have you back!

150
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:04,879
Huh...? Why did you just say the same thing twice?

151
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,462
Know what, never mind that for right now!

152
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:11,087
I wanted to ask you to take this key off of me!

153
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,129
Uhh... But why?

154
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:15,295
What do you mean "why"?

155
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,545
It's negatively impacting my school life!

156
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:19,712
I can never sit back properly in my chair.

157
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:22,129
Students look at me weird and one even filmed me!

158
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,754
I've been able to get by so far,

159
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:25,212
but I don't know if that'll last.

160
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:26,837
Ahh.

161
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,545
That key's so cute though.

162
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,004
But can't you see that as long
as I have it stuck on my back,

163
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:33,587
the other kids are never gonna
treat me like a normal girl?

164
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,504
It'll help make you popular!

165
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:37,212
I wanna be normal!

166
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:40,337
And I wanna have an ordinary high school life, so--

167
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,920
Huh?

168
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:14,420
Why? I never asked to have these crazy features.

169
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:17,087
At least my hand didn't come off at school.

170
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,920
What's the big deal if everyone
finds out that you're a robot?

171
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:21,420
People will think that I'm not cute

172
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,379
'cause everyone knows that robots aren't cute.

173
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,254
But robots are the cutest!

174
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,212
They're not even the littlest bit cute!

175
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,754
They are!

176
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:32,087
Is this gun barrel cute?

177
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,295
Yeah, it is!

178
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,379
And what about the USB drive in my big toe?

179
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:36,545
Adorable!

180
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,212
Even the sweet buns in my forehead?

181
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:40,087
I said it's cute!

182
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,462
Yeah? I say you're a mad scientist!

183
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:44,837
I said it's cute!

184
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:51,004
I just wanna live an ordinary high school life!

185
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:16,920
Wow! It's <i>chikuwa</i> !

186
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:22,379
Those sure are tasty!

187
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,420
Sorry I'm late, fellas.

188
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:51,754
Three. Two. One.

189
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,337
Four o'clock! Four o'clock!

190
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:01,045
Four o'clock! Four o'clock! Four o'clock! Four o'clock...

191
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:08,920
Four o'clock! Four o'clock! Four o'clock...

192
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:18,587
Hey there! It's me, <i>daifuku</i> !

193
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,379
And I'm cheap! Get your <i>daifuku</i> here!

194
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:25,420
Mr. Nakanojou! I hope you're doing well!

195
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:33,837
True <i>daifuku</i> don't talk!

196
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:43,504
I'm sorry. But I can't help it.

197
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:46,545
I get so worked up when I wear this mask!

198
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:49,212
I put my entire heart and soul--

199
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:56,295
What did I say about speaking?

200
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:59,920
Okay. Mistakes may have been made.

201
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:01,587
And I might have taken things too far,

202
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,087
but that's science for you.

203
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,254
I can't underestimate that robot.

204
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:08,629
It's gonna take all I have to bring her in and study her.

205
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:10,587
Enter Mr. Short Circuit!

206
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,379
My trusty robot disabling device

207
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:14,712
that's never failed me 'cause I've never used it!

208
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,587
I'm positive that this'll do the trick.

209
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,295
Or why else would I call it "trusty"?

210
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,004
Time is of the essence.

211
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:56,587
Run away!

212
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,587
Uh. Ms. Nakamura?

213
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:05,170
Hold on! What's this?

214
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:07,670
You need to you fasten that top button of yours, mister!

215
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,379
Would you just leave me alone?

216
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:11,212
I can have it unbuttoned if I want!

217
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:13,754
No way! You need to do what your student counselor says!

218
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,004
Ugh. Seriously?

219
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,462
You're playing the counselor card?

220
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,879
Yes, I am. Come here so I can button you.

221
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:21,587
I can do it myself! Don't embarrass me like that!

222
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,420
Uh...

223
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:27,754
What's going on?

224
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:31,462
I can't count on you to fix it,

225
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:33,045
so I'll just do it for you, Mako.

226
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:34,754
Hey, back off.

227
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,295
Wait, "Mako"?

228
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,545
Come here.

229
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,420
What are you doing manhandling me like that?

230
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,920
I said back off!

231
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:44,254
Hold still. I'll fix you up so you can go to class.

232
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,920
"Manhandling"?!

233
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:47,879
"I'll fix you up"?

234
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:49,087
Ugh, cut it out.

235
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,004
Hey, just stop groping me would you?

236
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,962
"Groping"?!

237
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:03,920
What kind of relationship do these two have?

238
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,837
Well, what do ya know, problem solved.

239
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,087
'Kay, see ya. Got places to be.

240
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,379
Hold on a sec!

241
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:10,837
Aren't you afraid everyone'll make fun of you

242
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,670
for being dressed all sloppy like that?

243
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:13,795
I'm sloppy?

244
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,254
You're the one who dresses sloppy

245
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,087
at home all the time, y'know?

246
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,337
"At home"? Does she wear a-a sloppy dress?

247
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:25,837
Sloppy dress at home! Oh, yeah!

248
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,879
Wait, that doesn't make sense!

249
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:30,379
When would a Chinese dress ever be considered sloppy?

250
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:31,837
Am I dumb or something?

251
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,962
How could I possibly be a teacher and be this stupid?

252
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:35,837
I've gotta pull myself together!

253
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,295
Think! What's counts as being sloppy in a normal sense?

254
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,712
Dressing like this?

255
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:45,754
Enough! Stop it! You idiot!

256
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:47,670
Are you finished? I'm outta here.

257
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:48,962
You didn't fix your button!

258
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:54,129
"The Life of Oguri Cap!" Check him out!

259
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:11,795
You idiot!

260
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,795
Are you finished? I'm outta here.

261
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,045
You didn't fix your button!

262
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:17,170
I've gotta follow.

263
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:18,504
Mr. Takasaki!

264
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:20,504
We found Nakanojou unconscious on the floor

265
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:21,504
of the science room!

266
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:23,295
Wha--?

267
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:24,879
We need you to come help like, right now!

268
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:27,170
--Hey, wait a second! --Leave me alone!

269
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,004
Okay. Now listen up.

270
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:38,545
Yeah?

271
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,004
I'm sure Nakanojou's fine!

272
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:43,004
Huh?!

273
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,837
That's right! He's probably just napping!

274
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,129
But I looked at his eyes and they're all whited out!

275
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:51,295
Wha--?

276
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:52,295
Fill them in.

277
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,587
Huh?

278
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,629
I'll give it a shot.

279
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:57,754
Wha--?

280
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:58,504
Don't do that!

281
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:00,670
Huh?

282
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,004
Look over there!

283
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,962
Give me the lowdown on this business!

284
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:05,254
It's my sworn duty as a teacher

285
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:07,212
to stop this kind of illicit relationship.

286
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:10,170
It's more important than, uh, you know.

287
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:11,629
Get what I mean?

288
00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:14,545
You mean Ms. Sakurai and her little brother over there?

289
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:15,587
Let's go.

290
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,504
'Kay?

291
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:17,879
Prepare yourself.

292
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,754
There's no time to waste.

293
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:29,420
After all, I am a teacher.

294
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:31,170
Hey, it's this way!

295
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:36,587
Hop! Hop! H--

296
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,504
Hop!

297
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:38,420
Hop!

298
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:39,254
Hop!

299
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:41,212
Hop!

300
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:42,337
Hop!

301
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,129
Next stop: Tokisadame Station, North Gate.

302
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:15,045
A stop has been requested.

303
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:18,379
That's not even close to your stop, dude!

304
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:21,754
Yeah, but it's so fun to push the buttons every time!

305
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:23,295
You pushed the last one too, right?

306
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:24,504
And no one even noticed

307
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:26,129
'cause someone had to get off anyway!

308
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:28,504
So I guess you're actually helpin' 'em out then!

309
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:30,462
Oh, look! Someone needed to get off again!

310
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:31,712
Hey, you're welcome!

311
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:38,420
Mom, where'd we put the daily calendar

312
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:40,045
with all those tear-off pages?

313
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:42,504
It should be in the closet, I think.

314
00:18:56,295 --> 00:18:58,170
Hakase! Hakase!

315
00:18:58,254 --> 00:19:00,462
Ah, Nano! Good to have you back!

316
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:04,254
Listen! I think it's about time
to take this key off of my back!

317
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:06,129
It's starting to cause more and more problems

318
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,212
in my daily school activities!

319
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:10,004
We did the high jump in gym class today,

320
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:12,004
and I could only belly roll over it!

321
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:13,754
And during soccer, I got put on the bench

322
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:15,587
because I fouled a kid with my key.

323
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,212
Okay. I can take it.

324
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:18,504
Splat!

325
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:24,754
If you were so willing, you should've told me earlier.

326
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:27,629
I gotcha. I'll take it right now if you want.

327
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,337
Not a day goes by that I don't wish

328
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,004
to have this thing off my body.

329
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,462
But now, I can finally start my new life

330
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,587
as a normal high school girl!

331
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,795
If you don't mind,

332
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:38,795
I'd like to get this key taken right away.

333
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,212
Cheese.

334
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,879
Hakase? Don't tell me you're--

335
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:46,045
I took it.

336
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:47,337
Plop!

337
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,170
I feel betrayed.

338
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,504
Why?

339
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,045
I thought you meant you were gonna remove my key,

340
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:54,629
not take a picture of it!

341
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:55,962
Oops, my bad.

342
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:59,129
So, are you ever gonna take off my key for real?

343
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:01,420
Let's see.

344
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:06,629
Hmm...

345
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:08,629
Kapow!

346
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:11,045
I've had it up to here with your silly gags!

347
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:14,087
Will you do it? Or will you not do it?

348
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,670
Calm down. I can do it!

349
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:19,587
I've taken more than my fair share of keys in my life.

350
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,545
So taking one more key like yours is gonna be a snap.

351
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:24,254
Coin, coin, coin, swish!

352
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,045
Wow! I can't believe you just went "coin, coin"!

353
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:31,629
And then flew away like "swish!"

354
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:35,587
Hakase! I have a question for you!

355
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:38,379
Lemme catch my breath.

356
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:41,004
I was laughing so hard I forgot how to breathe.

357
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,170
Listen, I can't help but notice that I'm making

358
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:45,295
some pretty strange reactions today.

359
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:49,004
You didn't, you know, do something to me,

360
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:50,545
did you now?

361
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,712
Well, actually, I gave you a funny bone feature yesterday!

362
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:54,629
Shibibi! Shibibi!

363
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,587
Shibibi! Shibibi!

364
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,629
Why would you give me such a
bizarre and obnoxious feature?

365
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:01,670
What is even the point of it anyway?

366
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:03,254
I thought it would be funny.

367
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:04,795
Thump!

368
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,420
Goal!

369
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:08,712
Dodododo!

370
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:10,045
--Mwah! --Bang!

371
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,420
This is it.

372
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:15,420
This is how I'm gonna die and it's gonna be awful.

373
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:16,920
See how much fun we're having?

374
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:19,379
I'm not having any fun!

375
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:20,254
All right then.

376
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:21,587
Forget about the key for a sec

377
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,004
and please just remove this funny bone feature.

378
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:25,420
That'll be a hundred yen.

379
00:21:25,504 --> 00:21:29,087
Boom!

380
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:23,879
This takes every last ounce of my strength.

381
00:23:27,587 --> 00:23:28,920
I'm oil.

382
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:31,045
People say I'm slippery, but I can't really blame them!

383
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:32,129
That's just who I am.

384
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:33,379
My boss pours me all the time,

385
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:35,712
but you're not the boss of me, so hands off!

386
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:38,754
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 16.

387
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:40,170
Look forward to it!
