00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:04,688
All right! Everyone ready to play?

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,521
Rock!

3
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:06,396
Paper!

4
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:07,313
Scissors!

5
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:08,229
Aw, man!

6
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:09,438
Aw, yeah!

7
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:11,146
Looks like I'm going first.

00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:15,354
♪ De-Li-cious pine-ap-ple! ♪

9
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:18,188
Rock! Paper!

10
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:19,604
Scissors!

11
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:22,229
Sweet! Here I come!

12
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,271
Hey, hold up! Rules say only one step at a time!

13
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:28,396
Oh, I'm well aware.

14
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:31,854
G-Li-co

15
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:33,979
Cor-por-ation.

16
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:34,896
Cheater!

17
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,229
What? But how?

18
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:38,104
You can't add stuff on at the end!

19
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:41,396
Why? I'm just using the company's full name.

20
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,438
Hey! That's fair, isn't it Mai?

21
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,521
Fifty-fifty.

22
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:51,354
Okay, fine. I'll let it slide.

23
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:53,313
But next time, I'm allowed to bend the rules

24
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:56,479
to work in my favor so we can even things out a little.

25
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:59,146
Now, rock, paper, scissors.

26
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:01,646
Look at that! Mai gets to go next!

27
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:08,271
Chi-yo-ta.

00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:26,771
Incantation of Revival.

31
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:11,646
It stopped working.

32
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:13,313
Aww, mom!

33
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:16,563
I thought I told you to wake me up at seven!

34
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:17,938
Where were you?!

35
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:18,979
Uh.

36
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:25,479
Seriously? Kick volleyball?

37
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,979
Just perfect!

38
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:35,729
I am gonna be so late!

39
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:38,021
Of all days, that alarm clock just had to choose

40
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:40,188
the most inconvenient time to crap out!

41
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,146
Even in death, I guess it found a way to alarm me,

42
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,229
but that's not the way it's supposed to!

43
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:46,104
Ugh, I hate irony!

44
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:56,188
All right, if I book it at my top speed,

45
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,313
I might be able to make it.

46
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:01,104
Wait. Hang on.

47
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:02,271
Rewind.

48
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:11,604
There was something beary suspicious!

49
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:13,354
Please tell me it's gone.

50
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:15,021
Nope! Here it comes!

51
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,313
Whoa, what the what?!

52
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:22,146
Who is this pro sprinter?!

53
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,146
And what are they doing chasing little ol' me?

54
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:29,021
There it goes!

55
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,313
Bring it.

56
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:54,021
Um. Excuse me.

57
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,813
Did you happen to drop this wooden fish?

58
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:03,646
Uh!

59
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,229
Or perhaps, it was this golden one?

60
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:12,146
I'm so dead.

61
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,104
I have no choice.

62
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,063
There's only one way.

63
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:20,938
Please take this and go.

64
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:26,229
Sometimes, I can be a bear.

65
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:28,354
And other times, I can be...

66
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:30,729
...hard to bear.

67
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:36,563
However! My true identity is...!

68
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:53,646
Oh! That was priceless!

69
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:58,563
Tada!

70
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:00,938
It was actually your older sister this entire time!

71
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:02,229
Bet you didn't see that coming,

72
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:04,479
since I used your uniform as a disguise.

73
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:05,688
Man! That was a bla--

74
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:11,396
Hm... A rather commendable corkscrew punch

75
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,813
on this fine morning.

76
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,188
Indeed! It was quite beautiful to behold!

77
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,146
Hey, give me some credit.

78
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:19,854
Disabling your alarm clock to set this up wasn't easy.

79
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:21,521
So it's all your fault!

80
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:23,688
All right, just chill out. I'll make it up to you.

81
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:26,271
I know, we can go get some ramen, on me. 'Kay?

82
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:30,146
That's my money in the first place!

83
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:37,521
Chi... yo... ta...

84
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:40,188
Ni-ke-ra-ha-to

85
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:43,729

86
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:46,938
ra-to-na-ri-ha-shi-te-to.

87
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:02,313
A shark. Wow!

88
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:03,938
I'm home!

89
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,354
Oh! What are you up to, Hakase?

90
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:08,604
Nano! Check it out!

91
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:11,563
That cloud's a shark!

92
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:16,563
Oooo! Let me sneak a peek.

93
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,396
Would you look at that!

94
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,771
Isn't it awesome?

95
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:24,229
It really is.

96
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:28,813
That's right! Almost forgot. Look what I bought for you!

97
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:30,354
Milk.

98
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:47,271
Is it 4.5%? That's the best!

99
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:49,479
Yup, it's the creamier kind.

100
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:51,354
But why this specific type?

101
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,521
And what made you want it so suddenly today?

102
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:57,604
Heh! Oh, you'll see.

103
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,896
It goes great with my swiss roll!

104
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:11,854
Wait!

105
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,979
Why would you install such a strange additional feature?

106
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:15,563
I needed you to hold my cake.

107
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:18,938
That doesn't make any sense!

108
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:21,563
Nano! Please pass me the milk!

109
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:23,188
This isn't the time for that!

110
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:25,563
I think I have the right to be informed when a whole cake

111
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:27,813
is being stored inside my arm!

112
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,979
Ah! So yummy and cold!

113
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:34,854
Please stop ignoring the issue.

114
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:37,729
Imagine if someone outside saw my arm open.

115
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:43,146
Rolly, rolly, roll! Rolly, rolly, rolly!

116
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:55,021
Excuse me.

117
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:56,229
What's up?

118
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:59,771
I, uh. Could I have some cake too, please?

119
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,313
Yeah, sure.

120
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,396
Gimme one second.

121
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,563
Here ya go!

122
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,771
I really appreciate it.

123
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:21,063
Uh. You kind of forgot the cake part.

124
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:22,313
Huh?

125
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:32,313
I know! I have an extra sweet bun you can eat!

126
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:36,563
Help yourself!

127
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:37,896
It went back in!

128
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:39,479
Oops! That's my bad!

129
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:41,229
I accidently pushed the button.

130
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:43,771
Ahh! Why do you keep installing so many

131
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:45,396
bizarre functions in me?

132
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:47,729
Have you ever even considered how people would react

133
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:50,146
if they saw my head pop open in public?

134
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:51,521
What would happen?

135
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:52,854
Well, uh...

136
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:56,021
Didja hear their new album?

137
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:59,396
Yeah, it was great!

138
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:04,104
'Kay! I'll add a feature that lets you play music!

139
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,688
I think you missed the point!

140
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,354
I'd like you to stop adding functionalities for no reason!

141
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:13,896
You're not listening to me at all, are you?

142
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,854
Jeez...

143
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,479
Uh?

144
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:52,396
What is it?

145
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,396
A sweet bun.

146
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,304
No you don't!

147
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:58,271
Not after you already had an
entire swiss roll to yourself.

148
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:00,104
What?!

149
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:14,646
Something wrong, what'd I do?

150
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,146
'Kay, Fine!

151
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,604
I'll just have my other bigger, better, rolly-rolly cake!

152
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:20,271
What?! Really?!

153
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,729
Not again! Where is it going to come out from this time?

154
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:25,021
My stomach? Or my leg? Or--

155
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,063
For real?

156
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:33,896
Wait, why didn't you just put all of the food

157
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:35,896
in the refrigerator from the beginning?

158
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,563

00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:20,313
Oh, Mio!

163
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:23,396
What's up? Your face looks weird.

164
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,229
Can I see your homework?

165
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,188
Don't tell me that you forgot to do yours again.

166
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:31,896
Well... I'm not exactly proud of it.

167
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:34,188
Girl, you know you're never gonna learn

168
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,438
if you keep doing this.

169
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,979
Oh, yeah, I get that.

170
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:38,979
Come on. Just this one time?

171
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:41,938
I promise I'll never do it again. Please?

172
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,146
Yuuko.

173
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,938
That's what you say every time this happens.

174
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,604
I swear on my life!

175
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:49,354
Yeah, and you say that every time, too.

176
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:52,229
Oh. Do I?

177
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,063
Fine. Twist my arm, why don'tcha.

178
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:58,146
This is for real the last one.

179
00:12:58,229 --> 00:12:59,563
Like, for real, real.

180
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,104
I hear ya loud n' clear!

181
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:03,479
You're totally saving my butt with this, Mio!

182
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,063
Hey, Yuuko!

183
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:07,021
You have to come over here and see this.

184
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:10,313
All right, I'll bring this back as soon as I'm done.

185
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:12,729
Coming! Lemme see what you got!

186
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:15,854
Hang on.

187
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:18,896
I get the feeling I'm forgetting something important.

188
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:22,188
After finishing my homework last night...

189
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:24,271
I did a thing...

190
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:25,521
I won't...

191
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,146
I drew something.

192
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,146
...let you.

193
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,021
And that thing I drew...

194
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:33,896
I forgot to erase it!

195
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,438
I won't let you do this.

196
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:38,021
It's still in there!

197
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:43,313
Hey! Got a little problem here!

198
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:45,563
Yeah, I getcha!

199
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:46,813
I know!

200
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,646
Yuuko!

201
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,563
Hey, I just remembered that I totally forgot

202
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:51,729
to do my homework, too!

203
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:53,396
So, you don't need my notebook after all!

204
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,938
So, yeah, I'll be taking this thing back now.

205
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,438
Sorry 'bout it!

206
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:02,729
Yuuko?

207
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:05,313
Come on, you don't need it anymore--

208
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:07,271
I know you're just trying to pull a fast one on me,

209
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:08,771
but I'm not gonna fall for it!

210
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:11,146
I'll have it back in no time, I promise!

211
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:12,354
'Kay?

212
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:15,354
All right, now where were we?

213
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,479
This is bad.

214
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:19,438
Really, really bad.

215
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:20,813
If anyone sees that drawing,

216
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:23,146
my reputation is gonna go down the drain!

217
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,479
Why does my fate have to be in the hands of Yuuko

218
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:29,146
of all people?! If she starts spreading rumors...

219
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:37,021
It'll be catastrophic!

220
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:41,771
Yuuko!

221
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:44,438
So, turns out I gave you the wrong notebook.

222
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:45,896
This one here's for math.

223
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:48,313
Huh? But wait, look.

224
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,271
This says "math" right here on the front.

225
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:57,146
Never mind! I need it back, 'cause uh...

226
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,396
I have a bad stomach ache!

227
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,396
Uh-huh.

228
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:05,813
Gah!

229
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:08,729
I'll be done in a jiffy, so hold your horses, would ya?

230
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:12,021
It's all over. She's gonna see it, and then...

231
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:17,771
That's it. My short-lived high school life is done for!

232
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:19,646
Listen!

233
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:23,729
I'll buy it off you for a thousand yen!

234
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:33,854
Why are you running away?!

235
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:35,438
Come back!

236
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:37,854
Fine then! You want the truth?!

237
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,479
I'll tell you!

238
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:43,021
It's gonna explode!

239
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,271
There's no way.

240
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,854
She's too fast for me to catch up to her.

241
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:54,563
I'll miss you, life.

242
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:56,938
It was good while it lasted.

243
00:15:57,021 --> 00:16:00,313
Thank you, existence, for everything.

244
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:02,563
We had a lot of fun, didn't we?

245
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:06,229
Sure, it got a little weird sometimes, but overall,

246
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:09,563
I was pretty happy with how things were.

247
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:15,146
But this is the end! My life is truly over now!

248
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:17,438
And my banquet of boys...

249
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,771
I bid you adieu, as well.

250
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,229
Goodbye.

251
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,604
Wait! There's no way I'll let that happen!

252
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:32,604
The fire in my heart... must become an inferno!

253
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,646
In the end...

254
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:26,479
...I failed.

255
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:31,604
Wait, Yuuko!

256
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:34,021
Stop running!

257
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:36,854
You're in the hall!

258
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:48,438
Hey. Are you okay--

259
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:49,521
Uh!

260
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:00,729
Here.

261
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,688
Pass your notebooks to the person in front of you.

262
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:06,271
And if you forgot your homework, please speak up now.

263
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,063
It was almost really bad there for a second.

264
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:12,354
But I guess all's well that ends well.

265
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:18,271
Now I can go back to living my ordinary... life.

266
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:19,729
Ahh!

267
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:20,563
Huh?

268
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:21,688
I never erased it!

269
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:23,688
Yo.

270
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,646
What seems to be the problem?

271
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:29,563
Teacher! I, uh...

272
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:31,521
Forgot my homework!

273
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:36,229
There we go.

274
00:18:36,313 --> 00:18:38,604
Hakase, would you mind tidying up the room

275
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:40,896
and putting your stuff away, please?

276
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:55,021
Sorry, but I just don't think I'm ready

277
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,188
to do something like that.

278
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:59,438
I'm gonna go play now.

279
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:03,563
Uh...

280
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,479
But then, I ended up telling him everything anyway!

281
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,188
Wow, are you serious? Come on, dude!

282
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:12,521
Um, excuse me!

283
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:15,104
Annaka! Could I have a moment?

284
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,479
Yes?

285
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:20,188
Well, you see. This is just a minor thing, but...

286
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:24,563
I think your hair ribbon might be too big. Don't you?

287
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:26,688
But look! Bunny ears!

288
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:38,063
Sweet buns are tasty.

289
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:39,521
You said it.

290
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,813
Welcome, miss!

291
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:10,438
Sasahara. You do realize that you're a member

292
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:13,063
of the cultural festival committee, right?

293
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,688
Can you at least try to be a bit more serious about this?

294
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:19,146
Oh, I'm being quite serious.

295
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:20,896
As the president of the drama club,

296
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:23,146
I'm always doing my part around here.

297
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:26,188
Or did you perhaps not notice that, Miss Tachibana?

298
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:29,438
Don't patronize me!

299
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,313
It's sweet.

300
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,479
Would you listen?!

301
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,104
We're supposed to decide on the programming

302
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,521
for the culture festival.

303
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:37,479
Your drama club has nothing to do with it!

304
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:39,604
Seems like they changed the brands.

305
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:47,729
Why on earth did I have to be paired up

306
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,271
with you of all people?

307
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:52,021
It tastes quite nice.

308
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:55,521
Here I am, wasting my time when the kendo tournament

309
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,646
is coming up. Ah, man.

310
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:58,979
I never should have volunteered

311
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:01,729
to be a committee member in the first place.

312
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:09,479
Heh.

313
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,146
What are you doing?! We need to come up with an idea!

314
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:18,104
But you're too busy reading manga over here.

315
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:20,896
Sorry, but this volume was just released.

316
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,146
Don't you have at least one good thought?

317
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:27,688
Was my Wine Tasting Tournament idea not suitable for you?

318
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:29,188
Of course it wasn't!

319
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,563
I already turned it down!

320
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:32,229
Think of something!

321
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:45,896
Hey, Sasahara.

322
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:51,896
So, what's your excuse for slacking this time?!

323
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:55,646
Well. I'm fresh out of ideas, for starters.

324
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:59,521
Huh. I'm not getting a signal here.

325
00:22:07,646 --> 00:22:10,896
What?! And where do you think you're going?

326
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:13,604
I'm taking a visit to the restroom.

327
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,396
This freakin' guy.

328
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:22,188
Huh. It seems like she was in no mood today.

329
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:25,021
I thought my Wine Tasting Tournament was a stellar idea,

330
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:27,479
but she thought otherwise.

331
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:31,688
However, she has yet to suggest a single idea of her own.

332
00:22:31,771 --> 00:22:37,354
Honestly, I'd fear for my life if I mentioned that to her.

333
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:40,813
There's only one way out,
I must be the one to present an idea

334
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,604
that she agrees with.

335
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,188
But that means...

336
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:47,854
I need to bring myself down to a commoner's level.

337
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:54,188
I suppose I have no other options at this point.

338
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:12,188
It's not like you're special to
me or anything like that, okay?

339
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:54,229
The purity of Asia.

340
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:58,813
I am a sweet bun.

341
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:01,396
Since I'm not very popular in the Kansai region,

342
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:04,188
people aren't exactly sure what to call me sometimes.

343
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:05,604
But now you know!

344
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:08,688
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 03.

345
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:10,271
Look forward to it!
