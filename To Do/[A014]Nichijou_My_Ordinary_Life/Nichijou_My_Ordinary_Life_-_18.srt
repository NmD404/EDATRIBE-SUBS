1
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:05,400
I'm telling ya,

2
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:07,359
Daiku Coffee is pretty great after that remodel they did.

3
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:09,067
Really?

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,775
See? Check it out!

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:11,984
You weren't kidding.

6
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:14,650
It's like a real café now.

7
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:16,150
Welcome!

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,900
I've already been here,

9
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:20,984
but take as long as you need to
figure out their menu and order.

10
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,817
Oh, really? Okay.

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,775
Yeah, lemme get a white chocolate mochaccino

12
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,609
in a grande, please.

13
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,109
Huh?

14
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:30,734
And if it's not too much trouble, can I get it with

15
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:33,442
caramel sauce, hazelnut syrup,
extra whip, chocolate chips,

16
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:36,567
and an additional shot of espresso, affogato style?

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,817
Screw this!

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,442
Wait! Where are you going?

19
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,525
My previous attempts at researching Nano Shinonome

20
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,734
were unsuccessful.

21
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:23,400
But luckily, I have a plan!

22
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:25,234
Now with double the oxidizing strength,

23
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:26,609
unleashing the power of oxygen,

24
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:29,317
it'll make my tough problems disappear like magic!

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,525
It's Mr. Oxidation Plus!

26
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,359
With this, I'll finally have my chance to study that girl!

27
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:36,692
For the sake of science!

28
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,775
I don't even know what I wanna study first!

29
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,109
There are so many options.

30
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,442
Maybe I'll start--

31
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,400
See what you can muster!

32
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:51,609
Oh, no. What do I do?

33
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:54,525
Whoa. I guess we're working
with these compass things today.

34
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,817
It looks like you're pretty excited to get started, huh?

35
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,609
Uh, sure!

36
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,025
Hey, guys!

37
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:00,775
Today's class is a study hall now.

38
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:03,567
Yeah! All right!

39
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,442
I wonder if it's because Ms. Nakamura collapsed again.

40
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:08,067
She sure does fall over a lot, doesn't she?

41
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,275
Hey, Sasahara!

42
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,484
You're supposed to be on cleaning duty!

43
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,442
I completed the sweeping responsibilities assigned to me.

44
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:21,359
Uh! But you left a pile of crap on the floor!

45
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:23,525
Hm. Did I really?

46
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:25,400
Go back downstairs and finish it up!

47
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:27,525
I'm curious as to how you knew that you would be able

48
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:28,650
to find me on the roof.

49
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,025
Don't be stupid!

50
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:35,525
It's a nice day so I came to enjoy the warm weather,

51
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,025
and you just happened to be up here, okay?

52
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,484
I see.

53
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:44,525
Sorry for troubling you.

54
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,359
I appreciate you always looking out for me.

55
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,567
Hm.

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,484
Don't you dare take it the wrong way!

57
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,984
It's not like I did it for you or anything!

58
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:01,525
Wow.

59
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:28,942
It's my day off!

60
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,609
I've got plans to meet up with Mai in the next town over.

61
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:33,942
She said that there would be
free candy involved if I came,

62
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:35,817
so how could I say no?

63
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,775
Want some bread?

64
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:41,692
Oh, no thank you, it's fine. I ate earlier, so--

65
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,192
I thought dogs were like, not allowed on trains.

66
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:51,900
Here.

67
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:53,067
I'm quite all right.

68
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:56,192
Look, my stop is coming up,

69
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,150
so I better hop out of my seat
right now and get ready to go!

70
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:04,067
The next stop is Tokisadametonyamachi.

71
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,900
Good call, Mr. Announcer man!

72
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,900
We've now arrived at Tokisadametonyamachi...

73
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:14,192
Perfect. Get me off this thing.

74
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:17,359
So long train-riding people. Yuuko out.

75
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,484
This is fine!

76
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,484
I'm just taking longer for dramatic effect!

77
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,192
I gotta keep my cool!

78
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,067
Once I'm off the train, this'll all be over!

79
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,859
I'm so sorry! I wasn't looking where I was going and--

80
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,567
Come on! Don't sweat it!

81
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,817
I'm in the next town over,

82
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,609
and it's practically a different country here!

83
00:05:46,692 --> 00:05:48,734
I'll never see any of these people ever again,

84
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,942
so it's totally fine!

85
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:56,025
Is it just me or am I being followed?

86
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,775
I'm just imagining things!

87
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,442
It's pro'bly 'cause I'm still flustered from earlier.

88
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,400
Things will be fine if I focus on getting

89
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:03,942
to the Daiku Burger place.

90
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:06,109
Where ever that is.

91
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:08,734
Well, according to the map Mai gave me...

92
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,859
...this thing is nothing but treble.

93
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:13,650
I'll just ask for directions. Yeah.

94
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:14,775
'Scuse me, but do you know how

95
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:17,900
to get to Daiku Burger from here?

96
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:20,650
Ah! Okay! That's it! You better stop following me around

97
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:22,525
or I'm gonna report you for breaking some sort of law!

98
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:23,859
I'm sure I can find one!

99
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,400
I heard you're looking for the Daiku Burger nearby.

100
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:27,942
I'm actually meeting somebody there,

101
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:30,400
so I can show you the way if you need some help.

102
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,734
Welcome!

103
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:42,900
Hm?

104
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:44,567
Sorry, Sis. Club ran long today.

105
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,817
You're late!

106
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,859
Looks like she was telling the truth.

107
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,525
Thank you for your patience!

108
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:55,442
I don't see Mai, so I guess she isn't here yet.

109
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:58,109
Aw, man.

110
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:03,067
This has been a day, and it's barely even started!

111
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,442
Oh, well. At least I'm in a different city.

112
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,275
Yeah! I just need to look at the bright side!

113
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,609
I'll learn from what happened here,

114
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:10,609
so I can be prepared for when it matters!

115
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:11,859
That's right!

116
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:13,567
If I can survive this level of humiliation,

117
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,275
I can take on anything the world throws at me!

118
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,734
Yuuko.

119
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:18,942
Sorry I'm late.

120
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:23,109
Wait, what? Is that what I think it is?

121
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,859
Trick or treat.

122
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,317
I'm already in this deep. Might as well commit.

123
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,942
I'm all in!

124
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:35,400
Trick or treat to you, too.

125
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:37,859
Don't they know Halloween was last week?

126
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,942
"The Life of Crow"! Check it out!

127
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,317
I'm not sleepy enough to sleep right now.

128
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,859
You could always try counting sheep

129
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,067
in your imagination.

130
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,025
I've heard that helps.

131
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,275
Okay, I'll try counting sheepies.

132
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,359
One sheepy jumping over a fen--

133
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:17,109
She fell asleep after one?

134
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,567
Wow, that really works!

135
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,942
Let me try!

136
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:22,359
One fluffy sheepy--

137
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:25,109
That sheepy never made it over.

138
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:32,859
There ya go.

139
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:36,025
Thanks a lot! You're the best, sis.

140
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:39,400
Hey, so does that Sasahara guy teach you

141
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,150
how to do stuff like this?

142
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,400
What makes you think that?! Huh?

143
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:46,859
Why would I ever go to a guy
like that to teach me anything?

144
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,359
I just thought you two seemed close, so--

145
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:49,942
Well, we're not close, like, at all!

146
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:51,692
And don't you dare think that we are! You got it?

147
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:53,692
Uh, sis, you're scaring me.

148
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:54,859
But if you two aren't close,

149
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,609
then why did you iron his handkerchief?

150
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:58,817
Uh, that was just something I found on the ground

151
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,359
and wanted to fix up a little.

152
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:01,484
Did you wanna make it nice

153
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,400
because it was Sasahara's?

154
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,400
Yeah, right. I would never do that.

155
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:07,442
I felt like practicing my ironing, and the iron

156
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:09,192
just so happened to be out and ready to use

157
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,984
and the handkerchief I found also just happened

158
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,859
to be sitting underneath it.

159
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:14,317
I guess.

160
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,900
Yeah! It was just circumstance!

161
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:19,525
Dang. She's so transparent.

162
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,692
That doesn't explain why you looked so happy

163
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,609
ironing something you found on the street.

164
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,567
There's a simple explanation for that!

165
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,234
It... was because...

166
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:31,317
It's because the Earth must've entered the Photon Belt

167
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,567
at that moment and reality shifted.

168
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,984
You'll never guess what happened!

169
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,234
Yeah? What?

170
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:56,942
I finally talked to Oono yesterday!

171
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:58,650
Wow! Really?

172
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:04,484
Two hours by train. And one hour by bus.

173
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:09,234
I left behind the hustle of city life.

174
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,942
In its place, I now have the peacefulness

175
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:14,317
of S Town's countryside.

176
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:26,609
I searched for so long,

177
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,150
never thinking for a moment that I would actually be able

178
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:30,900
to find it again.

179
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:32,567
Yet I never wavered.

180
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,525
I continued my quest for that one special book.

181
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:39,192
It brought a spark of color and excitement into my heart

182
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,109
when I was a child.

183
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:45,692
Coloring the gray, uneventful days of my youth.

184
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:49,234
This is the place. The library.

185
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,150
At last... I can see it once more.

186
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:06,234
Fate was kind enough

187
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:09,025
to bring me and this book together.

188
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:11,442
And fate has my thanks.

189
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,442
While trying to ignore my racing heart...

190
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:20,150
...slowly...

191
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:23,942
...I open up the cover.

192
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,317
Time's almost up, so finish what you can,

193
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,900
and don't forget to put your name on the top

194
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:37,525
before you turn it in.

195
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:42,359
Ten, nine, eight, seven.

196
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:43,442
Uh?

197
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:47,317
Six... Five...

198
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,400
And four... And three...

199
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:55,400
Two...

200
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:58,275
And one...

201
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:00,525
Zero!

202
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:03,275
Okay. Everybody pass your papers up to the front.

203
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,900
You do know that Halloween is over already, right?

204
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:32,275
Helvetica Standard.

205
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,609
Gross! I wanted to like this coffee,

206
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,442
but it's not very coffee-y.

207
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,734
You wanna run that one by me again? It's not coffee-y?

208
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:44,275
I can't really think of any other way

209
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,650
to explain how it tastes!

210
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:47,859
It's simply not coffee-y enough!

211
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:50,400
Here, try it and you'll see what I mean! Come on!

212
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:54,234
Okay. I don't see the big deal, it's just coffee, right?

213
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,859
It's not coffee-y enough.

214
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,400
Hop! Hop! H--!

215
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:02,317
Hop!

216
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,192
Hop!

217
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:03,984
Hop!

218
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,025
Hop!

219
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:07,234
Hop!

220
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:12,067
Hey, guys! I finally finished my latest project!

221
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,525
Look, Biscuit #2!

222
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:15,400
I'm Biscuit #2.

223
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:18,484
Oh. It's that thing.

224
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,775
Okay. Ouch.

225
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:24,317
Come on! Don't ignore him like that!

226
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,275
Um, but I've already seen this one before.

227
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:28,692
He's not a "one," he's a "two," and that's different!

228
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,442
He's <i>way</i> cooler than before!

229
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:32,942
Sure.

230
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,859
My name is Biscuit #2.

231
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:40,025
I was made by Hakase Shinonome, and I'm a biscuit robot!

232
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:43,525
As my name implies, I run solely on biscuits.

233
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:47,025
Biscuits are like fuel. They give me life.

234
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,067
Hakase, I require a biscuit at once!

235
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,609
Wha...?

236
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:52,942
But this is the last one and I wanna eat it.

237
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:54,275
Huh?

238
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:03,359
Biscuit #2's special skill is speed reading!

239
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,192
Check it!

240
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:06,275
I'm finished.

241
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,317
Done.

242
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,192
Uhh...

243
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:10,025
Why aren't you excited, Nano?!

244
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:12,734
Well, it's just that I can speed read also.

245
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,567
Then how come you always read so slow?!

246
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,734
Explain that!

247
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:17,900
Um, I enjoy taking my time with books.

248
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:19,275
It makes me feel like I'm reading them

249
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,317
like a normal person!

250
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:24,400
Yawn.

251
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:26,942
Now what seems to be the problem, Biscuit #2?

252
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,650
Looking at all of these tiny letters

253
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,234
is kinda making me sleepy.

254
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:32,775
That's how a normal person reads.

255
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,984
Why don't you ever say how amazing I am

256
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:40,400
when I do all this awesome stuff?!

257
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:42,775
Oh, wow, I had no idea it would make you that upset.

258
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:44,192
I'm not upset, you are!

259
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:45,984
If it helps, I've always thought what you do

260
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,275
is pretty impressive.

261
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:49,817
I'm pretty impressive,

262
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,400
but you don't have to make such a big deal out of that.

263
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:52,650
I don't know if I'm the one

264
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:54,400
that's making it a big deal.

265
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,609
Okay!

266
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:57,775
So tell me more about how impressive I am!

267
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:00,025
You're as impressive as a mountain range!

268
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,775
I don't know what that means, so try again.

269
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,400
'Kay. You have an incredibly vast knowledge!

270
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,734
Like it's big? As big as what?

271
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:09,359
How 'bout as big as a whale?

272
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,400
Oh, I like the sound of that!

273
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:12,734
Whales are pretty big, huh?

274
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:13,942
They're the biggest!

275
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,234
Never say something is good enough.

276
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:28,859
Never say "this is good enough."

277
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:30,692
"That's good enough."

278
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,484
So, what do you plan on doing?

279
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,567
Play a board game!

280
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,984
What's your act gonna be?

281
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,150
I'm doing an exciting,

282
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:47,734
yet intellectually stimulating, quiz game!

283
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,442
Entertaining the princess for prize money

284
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,109
seems like a great way to pass the time,

285
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:52,859
and it can end up being kinda fun.

286
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:54,317
Feels nice to enjoy ourselves

287
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,025
and take a break from all the serious stuff.

288
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:57,025
Yeah! For sure.

289
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm sure you all thought you knew where the ball was.

290
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,192
But in reality, it's under here.

291
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,025
Not bad, #66!

292
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:10,442
That's quite the hidden talent you got goin' there.

293
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,609
Heh. To be honest, my dream is to become

294
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:14,234
the Royal Magician someday.

295
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,942
I'd say that dream might become a reality soon!

296
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:17,817
I hope so!

297
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,317
All right! I'm getting pumped!

298
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,275
Let's get this thing started already!

299
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,734
Men! The time has come!

300
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:34,529
Silence!

301
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:38,567
We'll now proceed in the order
indicated by the slips you drew.

302
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,067
Whoever drew one, come forward.

303
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,567
That would be me!

304
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,400
Whoa, #66 right off the bat!

305
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:47,359
Looks like this will start with a bang.

306
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:49,775
The Royal Magician, huh?

307
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:52,150
Embrace your dreams, 66!

308
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:06,859
Now, go ahead and guess which cup has the--

309
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,942
I just wanted to be a Royal Magician!

310
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:12,650
Next.

311
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,650
Whoever drew two, step forward!

312
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:18,192
My turn now.

313
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:21,567
It's time to show the world what I can do!

314
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,817
I'll make a name for myself right here!

315
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,650
Hey. Who's that?

316
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:31,234
It's him, Funny 4! If anyone can do it, he can!

317
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:35,275
I am #4, here to entertain.

318
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:44,317
Next.

319
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,984
I can't believe 4 failed.

320
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,650
Hey, you doin' all right?

321
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,734
I'm up next.

322
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:53,067
Huh? Wait, aren't you the quiz guy?

323
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,609
I'm so screwed.

324
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:57,567
But I don't have a choice. The quiz game's all I've got.

325
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,734
But if I make it easy enough,

326
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:02,775
maybe it'll appease the princess
and I won't fall to my doom.

327
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:03,984
It'll be fine.

328
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,900
As long as she gets the answers right...

329
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,025
I'll just give her simple, easy-to-solve questions.

330
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:14,234
Uh, #6! And I'm here to give you a quiz!

331
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:17,775
Can you name something that has

332
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:21,442
the word "bread" in it but is also inedible?

333
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:24,900
Uh, it's a multiple choice question!

334
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:26,525
Uh, The first option is breadbox

335
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,192
and the second option is melon bread!

336
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,775
Wow, that's easy!

337
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:30,984
Ah!

338
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:38,067
I give up.

339
00:18:42,984 --> 00:18:45,609
That is... the correct secret answer!

340
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,442
My whole life, I regretted nothing.

341
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:52,609
Except this!

342
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,192
We're so dead.

343
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,317
Even the quiz master was sent packing.

344
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,234
Next.

345
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:00,900
Um, I'm #7!

346
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:03,692
And I can recite every location
the Olympics have ever taken--

347
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:09,067
We'll never forget your courage, #7.

348
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,859
What's the matter?

349
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,692
Is no one here capable of entertaining the princess?

350
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:17,359
What am I gonna do?

351
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:19,400
And here I thought a cheerleading routine

352
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:20,400
would be a good idea.

353
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:21,692
Speak for yourself!

354
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:23,234
I was splitting chopsticks with my butt cheeks!

355
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:25,025
I was gonna dance with a sushi mat!

356
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:28,275
I thought I'd be cool to shred a cabbage!

357
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:35,317
We're all doomed. Every last one of us.

358
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:40,275
Relax.

359
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,650
You didn't forget that you have me around, did ya?

360
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:45,025
Wait! You're the--

361
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:48,442
His harlequin antics have made him the best clown in town.

362
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,692
There's nobody funnier than this guy.

363
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:54,109
He's... Harlequeen 13!

364
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,984
I'll turn those frowns upside-down

365
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:59,317
and put on an unforgettable show in the process.

366
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,942
Boom!

367
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:01,442
Hang on a sec, 13!

368
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:04,150
I dunno what you have planned, but it's suicide!

369
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:08,734
Do you honestly think I would dance Swan Lake

370
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:11,234
or something stupid like that?

371
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:14,400
Just watch and learn.

372
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,025
I'll show you why they call me the Harlequeen 13--

373
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:25,067
Harlequeen 13!

374
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,692
Huh?! Why am I fall--?!

375
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,192
Next, #5.

376
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,775
Don't make me say it twice! Come on out!

377
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,275
Who drew that one? Who is #5?

378
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,650
Is that you?

379
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,942
No! That's just what it says on my hat!

380
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,817
Who is it then?

381
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,067
Not me!

382
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:44,942
Hang on. Aren't you #5?

383
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,984
Yeah. He's dead.

384
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:51,150
Number 5 had better step forward immediately!

385
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:53,025
What is the hold up?

386
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,650
Huh?

387
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:03,775
I knew it!

388
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:07,525
Next. I don't care who it is. Just go.

389
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:08,692
What do we do now?

390
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:10,067
We're all...

391
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,359
...completely screwed!

392
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,525
We could have a thousand more men

393
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:33,025
and it still wouldn't make a difference!

394
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:37,317
I've had enough of this stupid game!

395
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,525
And I won't watch this anymore!

396
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,650
I'll go stand in the hallway.

397
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,484
I'm a white chocolate mochaccino

398
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,734
with caramel sauce, hazelnut syrup, extra whip,

399
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:33,234
chocolate chips on top,
and an additional shot of espresso,

400
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:35,650
affogato style, in a grande size!

401
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:38,734
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 19!

402
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,400
Look forward to it!
