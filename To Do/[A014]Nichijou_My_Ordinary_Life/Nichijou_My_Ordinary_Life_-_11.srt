1
00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:05,175
Helvetica Standard.

2
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:06,700
Come on, you two.

3
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:08,659
When are you gonna get around to paying rent?

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,867
You're up to 60,000 yen now!

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,992
I'm so sorry.

6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:16,534
I don't want apologies! I want my money!

7
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,784
Last time, you said you'd be able to pay the rent in full

8
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,784
the next time I came around for it.

9
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:25,284
Well, next time is now, so cough it up!

10
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:30,867
There's no use stone-walling me in this situation.

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,617
I'm not leaving without your rent.

12
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,575
Um...

13
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:48,325
This is all a poor sparrow can spare.

14
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:27,659
One: Meso-American Slider.

15
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:30,284
Two: Western Box Turtle.

16
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,992
Three: Red-Bellied, Short-Necked Turtle.

17
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:34,200
It's two.

18
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:36,284
The answer is... number three.

19
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:38,492
Great job, everyone.

20
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,284
Whatever.

21
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,742
Hey, what are you still doing up at this hour?

22
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:44,950
Is your cold gone?

23
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,409
Mh-hm.

24
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:48,492
Then you should be good to go back to school tomorrow.

25
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:50,034
Your tests are coming up soon.

26
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:51,325
Fine.

27
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,950
You've been out for three whole days,

28
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:55,367
so you're gonna have to catch up on your homework quickly.

29
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,534
See if you can borrow your friends' notes from class.

30
00:02:58,617 --> 00:03:00,909
I better not see you bring home another failing score

31
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,950
like the last time.

32
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:03,284
You hear me?

33
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:06,159
Aw, come on, Mom! It's fine!

34
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:10,242
My finals don't even start until, like... tomorrow!

35
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,700
I totally forgot!

36
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:15,200
Why didn't you remind me?

37
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:18,117
You were much too sick to study anyway, so I let you rest.

38
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Nuh-uh! I'd study in my sleep!

39
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:20,950
Would you really?

40
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:21,742
I wouldn't!

41
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:22,867
That's what I thought.

42
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,950
You didn't even bring it up,

43
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:25,242
I couldn't even try to study!

44
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:26,867
Would you have studied if you'd known?

45
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,534
I guess not!

46
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:31,034
If you fail your exams, I'll kill you.

47
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,367
You don't have to go that far!

48
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,950
I'm super, ultra, great, delicious, wonderfully screwed.

49
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,867
Well, it looks like I have no choice.

50
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,534
The next school day starts in T-minus ten hours!

51
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:03,909
Luckily, tomorrow's tests are just for English and music.

52
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:07,534
In that case, I'll focus on English tonight.

53
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:09,450
'Kay, I just have to ignore

54
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:12,700
all of my natural lazy-person instincts and concentrate.

55
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:14,409
I won't procrastinate!

56
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:17,200
So that I can live on without regret.

57
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:20,409
So that I can laugh in each coming day.

58
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:23,242
Even through all the tears and sweat.

59
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:26,367
Even though obstacles stand in my way.

60
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,075
I will never give up.

61
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:32,325
I want to keep a smile on my face.

62
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,284
I am like a ship crossing the sea.

63
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,909
Sailing for the light where I want to be.

64
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:41,409
On a straight track.

65
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:44,034
Breaking the chains which hold me back.

66
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,159
Becoming my best self!

67
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:48,700
By Yuuko.

68
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:50,617
Perfect. I'm done...

69
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,825
...with a poem.

70
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:58,075
Things we think are freakin' cool!

71
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,450
It's nothing special. Fuggedaboudit.

72
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:07,367
The shy smile of a local mechanic!

73
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,700
It's go time.

74
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:10,159
I dunno what's gonna be on the test,

75
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:12,159
so I have to take it all in!

76
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:14,575
All right, vocab, come on!

77
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:15,409
Bring it!

78
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:17,784
Attempt: To make an effort.

79
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,534
Love: To earn my heart.

80
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:23,992
Always: We were always apart.

81
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:27,284
Confirmation: Your love is like.

82
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:31,617
Teleportation: It crosses even time, so.

83
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,992
Cosmos: Sailing through star and sky.

84
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:38,700
A midnight submarine: I want to ride with you.

85
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:40,117
Forever, with you.

86
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,825
Forever, eternally.

87
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,325
Forever, until the end.

88
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,825
I'm done! With another poem!

89
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,117
Ugh! It's over! I'm screwed!

90
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,534
No matter how hard I try, I can't study!

91
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:56,367
I'm so dead! My mom is gonna kill me!

92
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,992
Why did I have to get over my
stupid cold today of all days?

93
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:02,117
Being sick is way better than taking a test

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,659
that I'm doomed to fail!

95
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:07,117
If only I could be sick for a just little longer!

96
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:15,575
I got it.

97
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,992
My plan is completely foolproof!

98
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:21,325
Yup.

99
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,200
If I wanna get out of the test,

100
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,034
I'll make myself sick again!

101
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:30,950
It stings! But I gotta push through the pain!

102
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:33,534
My body is still weak from beating my last cold,

103
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:36,909
so I bet I'll be running a fever in no time.

104
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:43,700
Come on, come on! Just a little more.

105
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:47,325
If I can tough this out now,

106
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,034
then it'll all be worth it in the end!

107
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:55,492
The path will open!

108
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,700
If I can get a fever, then I'm all set!

109
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,700
I'll have some shaved ice for good measure.

110
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,700
I'll blast the AC, too!

111
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:04,242
And go to sleep on top of the covers!

112
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,159
Why do I have to be so freakin' healthy?

113
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:28,659
Yuuko! It's time to get up!

114
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:30,200
Last resort.

115
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,700
Thermometer... plus match...

116
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,367
...equals fever on-demand!

117
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,742
Are you up yet?

118
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:38,117
You're going to school today, right? Yuuko?

119
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,034
It burns! It burns!

120
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:41,325
What are you doing?

121
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,742
Mom, I got a fever!

122
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,742
Guess I must've gotten sick again.

123
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:46,075
How bad is it?

124
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,992
Uh. Well, lemme see.

125
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:51,950
Huh? It's 88.8 degrees.

126
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,075
What?

127
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,409
Now look at what you did! You broke it!

128
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:56,575
No, I didn't! I got sick again, I swear!

129
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,034
You seem perfectly healthy to me.

130
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,534
Yeah, It's probably because

131
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,117
there was something in the water.

132
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,284
Thanks, man.

133
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:06,950
I had no idea that today was the last day

134
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,492
to turn in our application.

135
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,950
One more day and the club would've been a goner.

136
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:13,034
But even if you turn in the form on time,

137
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,534
won't the club still get shut down

138
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:15,992
for the lack of members?

139
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:18,950
Nah, I wouldn't worry about that.

140
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,075
Tell ya what, how 'bout I bring you some juice tomorrow

141
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,242
as a thanks.

142
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:24,492
You don't have to do that. It's all good.

143
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,409
It's no problem at all! See ya!

144
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:30,034
Hey, I need to stop and buy a juicer

145
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,742
and an apple orchard on the way home.

146
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:32,950
Yes, sir.

147
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:48,200
Ah. So that's the power of the Daiku Group.

148
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:52,742
No string left.

149
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,159
I won't be able to tie together a straw doll

150
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:58,659
to put in the Principal's locker if I don't have any.

151
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:00,075
And what's worse,

152
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,992
it looks like I don't even have the straw to craft with,

153
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,367
nor do I have any money to buy any.

154
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,867
My wife handles the money, but she's gone.

155
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,117
We're all out of rice and I'm hungry.

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,450
At times like these, a swig of brandy would come in handy,

157
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:16,909
but my liver couldn't take it.

158
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:19,409
My favorite team lost, and for whatever reason,

159
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,867
the cheeseburger I ordered earlier

160
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,825
didn't have any cheese on it.

161
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,117
The visitor counter on the home page of my website

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,159
hasn't budged at all,

163
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:27,492
and not a single person logged on

164
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:30,617
to my usual online chat group yesterday.

165
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:53,575
That empty chat room reminds me.

166
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,200
When I got on to the bus the other day,

167
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:58,200
everyone else got off and left me alone.

168
00:09:58,284 --> 00:10:00,242
And that empty bus reminds me.

169
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:02,742
I went on a field trip back in high school.

170
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:04,409
Time for bed.

171
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:05,700
And just a couple of minutes

172
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,325
after we turned off the lights...

173
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:08,742
Who else is awake?

174
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,409
I asked everyone, but they were already asleep.

175
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:16,409
And speaking of sleep,

176
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,909
I haven't been getting much of it lately.

177
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:20,617
Since I can't get any rest,

178
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,950
I ended up snacking through the night,

179
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:25,825
and I've wound up putting on some weight.

180
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,325
And speaking of food,

181
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,784
I got a present for my birthday last month.

182
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:32,867
But it was just a roll of bread.

183
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:41,242
This is no good!

184
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:43,534
All of this negative thinking is getting me nowhere!

185
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:44,575
What I really need to do

186
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,200
is remember the good things in life.

187
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:49,742
Who could that be?

188
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:51,075
Yes?

189
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,700
Oh-ho!

190
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:53,992
Kimiko!

191
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:56,159
Mom is still away on her trip, right?

192
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:57,867
I thought I'd come by and make dinner.

193
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,575
I see. Well, thank you.

194
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,325
Hi, Grandpa!

195
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,534
Hello there, Mi.

196
00:11:02,617 --> 00:11:04,700
Oh. Looks like you've grown taller, huh?

197
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:07,409
Just what I needed.

198
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:09,284
I'll spend some time with my grandson,

199
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:10,784
who hasn't a care in the world.

200
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,034
Guess what, Grandpa?

201
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:13,367
Hm?

202
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,325
I made a dumpling when I was at the park earlier.

203
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,909
You can have it if you want!

204
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,159
That so?

205
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,492
You're hungry, so you should eat it!

206
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,867
How sweet.

207
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,825
It's real chocolate, so you're gonna like it!

208
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:31,534
Oh, can I really? Well, thank you.

209
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,159
What's with the water works?

210
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:36,617
I guess you've always been the sensitive type.

211
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,450
'Kay, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.

212
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:40,367
Okay.

213
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,200
That's right.

214
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,450
There's no point in focusing

215
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,617
on all of the negative things in life.

216
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,867
I made it with love just for you, grandpa!

217
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,075
Come on, hurry up!

218
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,784
Eat the dumpling! It's yummy, I promise!

219
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,992
Well, uh, this is...

220
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,117
Eat it! What are you waiting for?

221
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,159
You should eat it! It's tasty!

222
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:04,617
I'm sure.

223
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Somehow, happiness tastes just about as good as dirt.

224
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:15,534
Hey, Mom? Grandpa fell down.

225
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,867
Your order. Thanks for waiting.

226
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:56,284
There is nothing--

227
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,992
nothing greater than peace.

228
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:16,325
Trying to kill me?

229
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:20,075
It's finished!

230
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,075
What's up?

231
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:24,242
Super-duper glue!

232
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:26,659
That is quite large.

233
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:28,284
Because it's super-duper.

234
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:33,867
I'm gonna spread this so Nano and Sakamoto

235
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,950
will get here stuck when they least expect it.

236
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:39,992
What kind of prank are you tryin' to pull now?

237
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,909
You're being so obvious no one is gonna fall for your--

238
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:45,409
Gotcha!

239
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,784
You got me in what?

240
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:50,034
Hey! Get this stuff off of me!

241
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:52,034
I've got things to do, ya know!

242
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,617
It'll only come off with water.

243
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,325
Then go get some water and set me free!

244
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,450
Hold on, it's snack time.

245
00:13:58,534 --> 00:13:59,825
Hey!

246
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,159
Since it's snack time, I need to go to the kitchen,

247
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,367
so see ya for now.

248
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,492
No!

249
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,242
My feet. Hang on.

250
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,034
Oh, no. Uh.

251
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:11,450
Hey.

252
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:13,367
Do something. This sucks.

253
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,992
Heh. You look like a bug

254
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:16,659
who got stuck in a glue trap.

255
00:14:16,742 --> 00:14:17,992
What are you laughing at?

256
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,784
You're stuck in here, too!

257
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,492
Uh. Oh, that's right.

258
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:24,284
Serves you right!

259
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,075
That's some karma for ya!

260
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,700
That's weird. I-I can't get out.

261
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,825
It's your own fault for being such a troublemaker.

262
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:37,409
I've fallen and I can't get up.

263
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:40,159
Hang on. Where'd Sakamoto go?

264
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:45,284
Kitty-kitty? Kitty-kitty?

265
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,825
There you are!

266
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,742
This won't come off without water.

267
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:05,200
I won't be able to eat snacks if I'm stuck here.

268
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:07,617
What if I'm stuck to the floor for a really long time

269
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,325
and get super hungry?

270
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,659
I won't be able to eat my snacks.

271
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:13,159
Am I'm gonna starve?

272
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:15,867
I don't wanna become a skeleton.

273
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,575
I'm actually dying here.

274
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,242
Hello! I'm back!

275
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:22,117
It's Nano!

276
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,659
I'm happy to be home.

277
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:26,034
It's so hot out there and-- What happened?

278
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:27,492
How'd you end up like that?

279
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,950
Well, I put down this glue!

280
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:32,367
Just like that! And it got all sticky-like!

281
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,034
But then I tripped and fell,

282
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:36,242
and got stuck in it, and now I need water, and I need...

283
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:37,367
Water?

284
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,617
That's right!

285
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,575
You should really get up off the floor first.

286
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:44,034
And then we should get this mess cleaned up before--

287
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:48,117
Huh? What is this stuff?

288
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,825
Hey! Uh.

289
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,242
How did he--? Here, I'll, uh--

290
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:56,492
Oh, no! My hand came off!

291
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,659
I don't understand what's happening!

292
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,825
Oh, no! My other hand!

293
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,367
President.

294
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:28,575
So this is the true power of the Daiku Group.

295
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:49,950
Ha. Well, that sure was a lovely rainbow we just saw.

296
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:33,367
Hey! Guess who!

297
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,700
Well, is it Hakase?

298
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:38,909
Yay, that's correct! Good job. How'd you know?

299
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:43,325
I mean, it's kinda obvious. No one else lives here, so...

300
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,575
Okay! Now it's your turn to play, Nano!

301
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,325
Huh? All right then.

302
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,450
Hey! Guess who!

303
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:50,409
You! Nano!

304
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:54,284
It's another peaceful day

305
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:55,784
at the Shinonome household.

306
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,659
Hey, Nano! I was right, right?

307
00:17:57,742 --> 00:17:59,909
Uh, yeah. You were.

308
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,867
Great! I get to go again now!

309
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,575
So turn around!

310
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:04,700
Sure.

311
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,700
This is bad. So bad.

312
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:30,950
Really bad!

313
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm still stuck on the first stupid question!

314
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:34,200
What is this thing?

315
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:36,742
It looks like some sort of low-level monster or something.

316
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,284
But how do I describe that in one word?

317
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:44,117
Wait, I've seen this. But where?

318
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,909
I think I asked Ms. Sakurai about it before, but when?

319
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,325
Let's see.

320
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:50,950
What is this supposed to be?

321
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:53,034
No, I'm not asking about the answer.

322
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:54,117
I'm wondering if you were the one

323
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,159
who drew this low-level- looking monster.

324
00:18:56,242 --> 00:18:59,492
That's it! I did ask about this dude!

325
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,367
I don't remember what she said!

326
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,950
Just calm down! I need to breathe.

327
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:07,992
If I panic, I won't be able to think straight!

328
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:10,617
All right, focus. What is this thing doing?

329
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,575
Flying? Was that it?

330
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:14,450
No, it can't be.

331
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:16,450
This little guy is so distracting!

332
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,742
Why can't I stop focusing on this monster?

333
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,617
Wait, monster?

334
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,784
This isn't just testing my language skills.

335
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,742
It's testing my sanity.

336
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:27,784
But this is the best I can do, so I should just move on.

337
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,992
So what's next?

338
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:35,159
It's the same monster swinging a tennis racket!

339
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:38,575
Which means the first answer is definitely not monster.

340
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:40,784
Why is this thing torturing me?

341
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,825
I'll just erase my first answer and start over.

342
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:48,159
Where is my eraser?

343
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:52,784
Every dang thing in my stupid life sucks!

344
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:56,284
What do I do now? This is so bad!

345
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:59,700
Do I just have to live with my mistakes?

346
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,909
Mai! You saved me!

347
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:08,117
I'm so glad we're friends! Best friends!

348
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:10,867
A sand eraser?

349
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,784
I can't use this! It'll rip my paper!

350
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:13,950
That defeats the purpose!

351
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,825
I don't have time to worry about that!

352
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:17,534
I need to see if Mai has a--

353
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,534
She went to sleep!

354
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:22,367
Uh. All right, ten minutes remaining!

355
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,700
My time! It's ticking away!

356
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:29,534
Come on, I gotta calm down.

357
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:30,909
That's right.

358
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:35,159
I have to relax... and just clear my mind.

359
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:39,075
Purge all thought. Be free.

360
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,867
Okay. And time's up!

361
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,909
No!

362
00:21:18,742 --> 00:21:20,659
It's raining.

363
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:29,367
Only in my heart.

364
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:07,825
Good morning, sir!

365
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:09,450
Yes, good morning!

366
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:12,200
No way! I just got a love letter!

367
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:13,867
Are you for real? Who sent it?

368
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,075
It says it's from Tanaka in Class Four!

369
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,534
Come on! Open it already!

370
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:19,367
Don't rush me!

371
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:28,992
I'm a dirt ball.

372
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,492
I'm an iron ball!

373
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,784
I'd tell you a joke, but none of mine are clean.

374
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:35,784
And I shall strike when the iron is hot!

375
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:37,325
Clang-clang!

376
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:39,159
The next episode of <i>My
Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 12.

377
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:40,617
Look forward to it!
