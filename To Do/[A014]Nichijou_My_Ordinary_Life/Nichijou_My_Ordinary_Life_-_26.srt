1
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:03,262
Hey, so, idea.

2
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:04,720
Yeah?

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,595
We should throw Nano a surprise birthday party!

4
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,887
Oh, sure! When do you wanna do it?

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,804
Today.

6
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:10,887
Today?

7
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,429
You could give us more of a heads up

8
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,012
before planning this stuff.

9
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:14,970
My b!

10
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:17,345
'Kay.

11
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:18,720
I got nothin'.

12
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:20,595
What can we put together in a day?

13
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:23,095
Well, I honestly don't even know
if today is her actual birthday,

14
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:24,845
so I wouldn't sweat the details too much.

15
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:26,012
Then what's the point?

16
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:26,845
Because.

17
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:27,762
Because what?

18
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:29,137
That's what makes it a surprise!

19
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,470
I guess so?

20
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:31,387
Hakase, too.

21
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,637
Huh?

22
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,887
We should also celebrate Hakase's birthday today.

23
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,095
Ooh! Yeah, sure!

24
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,720
Knocking out two birthdays at once? I like it!

25
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:41,304
Now that I think about it,

26
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:43,929
I guess surprise parties can still be fun for everyone,

27
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:46,929
even if it's not anybody's birthday.

28
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:48,220
Okay, I got it!

29
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:49,470
We should all go pick up a cake

30
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:51,429
for the party after school today!

31
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:52,637
Let's do it!

32
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,512
Does that sound good to you, Mai?

33
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:55,762
I left my purse at home.

34
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,595
Oh. That's all right.

35
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,179
Yuuko and I can split it then.

36
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:03,012
I actually forgot my wallet, too.

37
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:06,345
Please, Mio! We're beggin' ya!

38
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:07,804
Uh...

39
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,554
I suppose I never paid you back

40
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,220
for all that money I lost at the amusement park.

41
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,887
So, don't worry about the birthday cake.

42
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,887
It's on me.

43
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:18,970
I'm gonna go tell Nano about

44
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:20,554
the awesome party we're throwing for her!

45
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:21,929
It's supposed to be a surprise!

46
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:25,429
Close one.

47
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:26,970
I forget how dumb you can be.

48
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:31,429
Uh... Yeah?

49
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:33,429
Well, at least Koujirou didn't shoot me down.

50
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:34,387
Wow!

51
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,345
Hey! I wasn't shot down!

52
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,470
Oh, yeah? Then why'd you run away crying?

53
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:40,054
I, uh...

54
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:41,970
I was just surprised by the sudden turn of events

55
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:44,429
and needed a hot second to process it all, 'kay?

56
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:47,304
Koujirou having a girl on his arm doesn't mean anything!

57
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:50,137
And I haven't even tried to tell him how I feel yet.

58
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,720
Unless he turns me down to my face,

59
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:53,262
I won't give up on him!

60
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,220
He's the guy that I love! Got it?

61
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,012
So, deal with it! Okay?!

62
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,387
All right!

63
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,470
Do I have everything? Yup!

64
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,595
Hakase! I'm heading off to school now!

65
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:24,720
Nano!

66
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:25,887
Yoink!

67
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,595
Huh?

68
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,887
What'd you do that for, Hakase?

69
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,220
Because! I made you a little guy
so I'm taking the big one off!

70
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:46,637
Hang on. What exactly do you mean by "little guy"?

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,429
Here, I can show you.

72
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,804
It's, uh.

73
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:52,429
Are you saying that my back could be smooth

74
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:53,470
with this "little guy"?

75
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:56,512
Uh--yeah, I guess.

76
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,637
But this little guy can do more than just that!

77
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,762
It can, uh... Wait, uh...

78
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:06,012
--Nano? --Yes?

79
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,137
I kinda lost it.

80
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:10,220
Oh, no!

81
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:11,304
What's the matter?

82
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:12,304
Why are you being so rowdy

83
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:13,970
this early in the morning?

84
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:18,554
You little brat!

85
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:20,262
Stop leaving these weird traps all over the place!

86
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:23,512
Sakamoto broke the little guy I was gonna give you!

87
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:24,762
Wha?

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,970
Wait! Hang on, I, uh...

89
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:31,762
No. It was an accident!

90
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,554
Look! Mean old Sakamoto made Nano cry!

91
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:36,137
What are you talking about?

92
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,595
You're the one who left it on the ground!
It's not my fault!

93
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,970
I'm gonna go to school now.

94
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:48,220
Nano! You forgot this!

95
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:53,887
I, uh...

96
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:57,304
I can make another one if you want me to.

97
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:01,345
Would you be able to finish it before I get home?

98
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:03,929
It's not hard for me to make, so yeah.

99
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,512
Okay!

100
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,304
I'll be back real soon!

101
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:13,054
Great!

102
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:15,345
All right, I'm off!

103
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,679
See ya later!

104
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:19,720
Yeah. See ya.

105
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:28,095
Oh, my, how bizarre.

106
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:29,637
Huh?

107
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,429
Vice-Principal!

108
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:34,387
If it isn't the statue of me that stood in this very place

109
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,387
when I held the position of principal at this school.

110
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,679
Yes. Strange indeed.

111
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:43,179
I wonder what happened to your
statue, Principal Shinonome.

112
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,054
These young students do the darndest things.

113
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:50,970
I simply can't understand the
humor behind pranks like these.

114
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:52,845
It just doesn't make any sense!

115
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:54,054
Unless there is a reason.

116
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:58,512
Perhaps I have some secret supporters in the student body.

117
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:02,345
Vice-Principal!

118
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:03,887
We finished your delivery!

119
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:08,262
This is where you wanted us to put the statue, right, sir?

120
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:11,720
Uh, well, um, you must be mistaken.

121
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:18,345
Hey wait. Was this... your doing?

122
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,054
Uh--that's ridiculous.

123
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:26,345
This must be another part of the
prank the students are pulling.

124
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:29,554
It's quite elaborate, don't you think?

125
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,012
Excuse me, young man,

126
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,304
but could you take this statue away as well?

127
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:36,470
Huh? You really want us to take this dinky statue back?

128
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:37,387
Dinky?!

129
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,970
Understood, sir!

130
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:41,304
We'll be hauling this ugly thing
out of your sight immediately!

131
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:42,720
Ugly?!

132
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:45,387
Hey! We gotta load up this pathetic-looking one, too!

133
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:49,804
It's okay, Vice-Principal.

134
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,304
Don't take it personally.

135
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:53,095
We can put it right next to the crappy one

136
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:54,929
we already have on the back of the truck!

137
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:57,012
What?!

138
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:09,887
Huh? It's unlocked.

139
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:12,345
Hmm?

140
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:17,179
Oh, wow, I didn't expect you to be so early.

141
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:19,262
I thought I'd be the first one here.

142
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,637
I took the blackbird and everything.

143
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,512
So, did you come in to take part in the morning practice?

144
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,137
Well, I...

145
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,679
I, uh... just, uh...

146
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,262
I did!

147
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:35,179
What? Really?

148
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,595
Yes.

149
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:55,595
I should've known that I would end up

150
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,679
buying both of your lunches, too.

151
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:58,845
Sorry!

152
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,595
Nah, since you both forgot your wallets,

153
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,054
I really don't mind it.

154
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:04,054
Wow! That's so generous of ya!

155
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,095
You're the bestest!

156
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,720
Whoa. I hit too hard.

157
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,595
Yeah. You should really be more careful, you know.

158
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,429
That's my bad!

159
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:16,554
That's my head.

160
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,262
Sorry, I didn't see you there, Mai!

161
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,845
Me neither.

162
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:26,720
Oh! By the way, did you end up asking Nano

163
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:28,929
if we could come over to her place later today?

164
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:30,845
Crap! I totally forgot to!

165
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,929
So, I'll run and tell Nano about
her surprise party right away!

166
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,095
No! It's supposed to be a surprise!

167
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:39,720
Just ask if we can hang out at her house later!

168
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:41,054
I knew that, silly!

169
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:42,762
I don't think that you do!

170
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,595
Fine! I'll ask her myself!

171
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,470
Come on! I said I'd do it!

172
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:47,845
Yeah, and that's the problem!

173
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:49,179
Aww, you can trust me!

174
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,262
I really can't!

175
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,137
I can ask her.

176
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,595
Uh--wait! Hang on, Mai!

177
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:58,012
Don't worry about it! Just gimme a chance!

178
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,012
'Kay, I'm gonna go find Nano and ask about the thing!

179
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:06,929
I totally got this, guys!

180
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:16,429
I'm sorry!

181
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,220
No worries.

182
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:19,637
Godspeed!

183
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,762
Uh, yeah, sure, thanks.

184
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:24,595
And I'm really sorry! And, uh, bye!

185
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,095
Aw, man!

186
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,304
But I didn't want coffee.

187
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,262
Oh! That was my bad!

188
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:38,512
No big deal.

189
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:40,387
I get you're probably in a hurry right now.

190
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,929
I am! But I'm still sorry!

191
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:44,304
Come on!

192
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:53,720
Uh?

193
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:04,554
Um! Excuse me!

194
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:07,429
No running in the hallway!

195
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,012
Rainbow.

196
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:25,845
I just can't believe that it's actually over!

197
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:31,095
Found it!

198
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:35,304
Huh? Huh...

199
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,345
Aw man, that one stung.

200
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:50,595
--Yuuko! --Huh?

201
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,095
You're not hurt, are you?

202
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:55,429
Oh! You're just the person I was looking for!

203
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,554
You were trying to find me?

204
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,470
Yeah! I actually wanted to--

205
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:01,262
Wait! That's not--!

206
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:02,179
I, uh...

207
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:03,887
Whoa! Are you okay?

208
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,345
I didn't hurt you, did I?

209
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:08,720
Oh. Don't worry. I'm all right.

210
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:11,179
Really? Well, that's good.

211
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:15,345
And, uh, this isn't what you think it is, I swear!

212
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:16,887
It's a trick I can do!

213
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,470
Anyway! I wanted to ask you

214
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:20,554
if me and the others could come
over to your place later today.

215
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,679
Huh? Sure you can.

216
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,554
Oh! Also, it's--!

217
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:26,679
Heh, heh, heh. I can't tell you anything else,

218
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:28,137
'cause it's a surprise!

219
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,512
Um, okay.

220
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,845
We'll see you later then!

221
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:33,554
Yeah. Sure.

222
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,762
It looks like I'll have to buy more

223
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:42,304
if Yuuko and the others are stopping by.

224
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:43,679
Can you believe we made it to the end?

225
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,595
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

226
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,804
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and one, two, three! ♪

227
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:59,345
What the heck?

228
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:44,095
This dumb pumpkin is too strong!

229
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:49,304
I'm so sick of that kid.

230
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:50,554
Why does she always pull that--

231
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:51,929
Taisho?

232
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,429
Is that you, Taisho?

233
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,137
It is!

234
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,804
Wait! Nakamura?

235
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:58,470
I've been looking all over for you!

236
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,387
I'm glad you're okay.

237
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,762
Why are you running?

238
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,429
Don't you remember who I am?

239
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:04,720
Of course I remember!

240
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,929
That's why I'm running!

241
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:09,012
Taisho, time for dinner.

242
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:09,929
Here.

243
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:16,137
Hm? What's the matter, boy?

244
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,429
Are you not hungry? Huh? Huh.

245
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,179
What's wrong, Taisho?

246
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,470
Time for your bath.

247
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,054
And now.

248
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:32,929
Bad kitty!

249
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,595
Oh, no. I have to hurry or I'll be late.

250
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,304
Okay, Taisho. I'll see you when I get home.

251
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:39,137
Bye.

252
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,887
Wow! Close one.

253
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,929
Gotta run.

254
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:49,929
Taisho!

255
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:52,387
Where'd you run off to, kitty?

256
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,512
Taisho!

257
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:56,220
Just get out of here already!

258
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:57,637
Oh! Ms. Nakamura!

259
00:13:58,595 --> 00:13:59,762
Nice to see you!

260
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,137
Uh, Nano?

261
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,845
Perfect! I'm sure she can do something!

262
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,637
Is something the matter?

263
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,762
You looked like you were searching...

264
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,095
It's like she's a robot moth

265
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,304
drawn to my flames of science!

266
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,470
But... I can locate Miss Shinonome

267
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,345
any time I want at school.

268
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:16,429
Right now, my cat takes priority.

269
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:17,929
Sorry to bother you,

270
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:19,804
but have you seen a black cat around here?

271
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:22,262
Oh! You wouldn't happen to own a black cat, would you?

272
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:23,512
What a fun coincidence!

273
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:24,970
Well. Sort of.

274
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:26,512
He ran away a while ago.

275
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:27,720
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,762
I have a black cat, too, so I can sympathize.

277
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:31,220
That so?

278
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,887
Would it be okay if I helped you look for him?

279
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,887
Of course.

280
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,512
Sorry for the inconvenience.

281
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:37,512
Not at all!

282
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:39,012
You are useless!

283
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,970
So, can you tell me more about your cat?

284
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:43,845
I heard you call out a name earlier.

285
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:44,679
What was it again?

286
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:45,970
It's Taisho.

287
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,304
That's an interesting name for a cat.

288
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:50,137
Huh?

289
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,804
My cat's named Sakamoto,

290
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:54,345
because that's what was written
on the box we found him in!

291
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,637
That's a weird way to name a cat.

292
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,179
That's true. It really is kind of weird, I guess.

293
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:04,262
Tell me, is he cute?

294
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:05,095
Huh?

295
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:06,220
Your cat Taisho?

296
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,595
Is he a cute kitty?

297
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,137
Heh. What a ridiculous question!

298
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,595
Of course he is.

299
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,762
Well, it's not like she meant to

300
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:17,970
treat me poorly on purpose.

301
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:20,179
Then again, if she kept that up,

302
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,970
my day's probably would've been numbered.

303
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,554
Wait, now that I think about it,

304
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:28,304
that's not any different from how I have it right now!

305
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:32,304
If I were to compare the two, they're equally bad!

306
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:34,304
Oh, it's this late already?

307
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:36,387
I'm sorry about this, Ms. Nakamura,

308
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,595
but I have to start heading home

309
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,220
since this won't stay fresh for very long.

310
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:43,387
Ah. Sure. That's fine.

311
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,637
When you find Taisho,

312
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,637
would it be okay if I came to visit him?

313
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,304
Of course!

314
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:51,262
You can visit whenever! Any day! Tomorrow even!

315
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:53,845
Well, I look forward to it.

316
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,304
Same here!

317
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:02,345
This--this sucks!

318
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,387
It doesn't matter who I go with, they're both the worst!

319
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:12,054
Hakase! Sakamoto! I'm home!

320
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,137
Nano!

321
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,429
Here's the little guy!

322
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,929
You really managed to finish it?

323
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,095
Yeah! But Sakamoto stepped on it again!

324
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:24,637
Sakamoto...

325
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,054
Yoink!

326
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:30,012
Wait. Did you--?

327
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:32,220
You're still okay with taking that off?

328
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:34,220
I'll make another one, quick!

329
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:38,762
You're the best!

330
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:41,845
♪ This goes here, and that goes here... ♪

331
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:44,887
I had no idea that this key would come off so easily.

332
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,095
It wouldn't budge at all

333
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:48,095
whenever I attempted to remove it by myself.

334
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,429
That was me!

335
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:50,929
I made it so you couldn't take it off yourself,

336
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:53,220
but any other other person could do it easy-peasy!

337
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,387
Of course she did.

338
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,720
Plot twist!

339
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:57,887
Anybody can hook it back up, including you, Nano!

340
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,679
That's an oddly specific feature.

341
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,387
I've been meaning to ask.

342
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,970
How will this new little guy
affect all the features I have?

343
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:06,470
Huh?

344
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:07,720
Once you have this new part in,

345
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:10,095
your big toe won't be able to fly off anymore.

346
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,137
I wouldn't consider it a loss.

347
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,679
That must be Yuuko and the others.

348
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:20,012
Wha? Yuuko!

349
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,762
Yuuko's here!

350
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:25,512
Oh, that's right!

351
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:27,637
I should probably hide this key.

352
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:33,054
I'm so glad I look like normal person now.

353
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,929
Maybe I'll get along better with everyone

354
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,470
without having to worry so much.

355
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:39,512
I'll be able to do things normally.

356
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:44,012
I can just live my ordinary life, doing ordinary things.

357
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:45,262
Anyway!

358
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:46,554
I wanted to ask you if me and the others could

359
00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:48,470
come over to your place later today.

360
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:53,304
I wanna leave it on 'cause it looks cute.

361
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,220
As long as you're happy with who you are,

362
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:59,512
that's all that matters.

363
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,929
I just wanted to stop by here and tell you that.

364
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:03,595
But I got distracted.

365
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,512
Nano!

366
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:20,220
Nano!

367
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:21,429
Hey, kid.

368
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,345
Shh! This is the important part!

369
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:37,179
Let's do it like we practiced!

370
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,054
All right, I got it.

371
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:41,679
Ready, and...

372
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:43,387
Hey, Nano!

373
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:46,637
Ta-da!

374
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,470
We brought a yummy cake for you!

375
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:50,012
To celebrate your birthday!

376
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,012
Huh? You all did what?

377
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:53,262
For my birthday?

378
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,970
Wait, how did you even--?

379
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,804
It was part of the surprise. Are you surprised?

380
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,179
Is that cake? I want cake!

381
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:01,679
Gimme! I want cake! I want it, I want it!

382
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:02,595
Hang on, Hakase!

383
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,679
You gotta wait your turn!

384
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:05,845
Be careful with that!

385
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:07,637
We're all gonna share.

386
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:11,387
Well, that sucks.

387
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,512
My cake!

388
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:13,429
What are we gonna do?

389
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:15,304
Mio spent a lotta money on that!

390
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,679
I brought another one.

391
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:18,804
Mai!

392
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:19,679
What the heck?

393
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:21,054
A shark!

394
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:26,970
What was that? Do it again!

395
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:29,637
Nah! This time it's Mio's turn!

396
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:33,679
I wonder how they found out today was my birthday.

397
00:19:33,762 --> 00:19:35,470
I didn't tell anyone.

398
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:52,887
Nano!

399
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,929
I finished making the little guy!

400
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:57,429
Thanks, Hakase!

401
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:02,637
Honestly, I always felt that this key was inconvenient,

402
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,762
and I really wanted to get rid of it.

403
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:10,804
But now,

404
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:11,929
I like it!

405
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:14,804
This key's part of who I am! Huh?

406
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:17,262
Now, with this little guy in, you have an extra feature

407
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:19,054
that makes your key spin around and round

408
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,512
whenever you're genuinely happy in your heart of hearts!

409
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,095
What's the point of that?

410
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,804
Oh! That's right!

411
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:30,554
Hakase, do ya think you could help me

412
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:32,345
carry this cake in to the other room?

413
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,345
Whoa! You got another cake?

414
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:36,762
I'll be right behind you after I make the tea.

415
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:41,095
Got it! Cake time, cake time, cake time, cake time!

416
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:44,845
Hakase?

417
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:46,262
--The cake. --Not another one.

418
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,220
Hey! Be more careful with stuff like that!

419
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:51,554
Are you okay? Any way I can help?

420
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:54,054
I just need something to wipe this cake off me!

421
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:55,054
Right!

422
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:56,054
I'll put the candle on it.

423
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:57,220
I wanna do it!

424
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:58,637
That's no fair!

425
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,929
We can save that for later.

426
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:01,345
Help us clean all of this up first.

427
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,345
We gotta clean it up before the cake cakes!

428
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:09,762
Hang on, Mai!

429
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:12,137
Hang on. What' so funny?

430
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,262
I, um... Uh...

431
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:15,679
Another one.

432
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,804
No! Stop! One's enough!

433
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,220
I still don't get what's happening!

434
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:27,887
I did it.

435
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,970
You better not have hay fever.

436
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:15,470
I'm fine, I just can't stop sneezing.

437
00:23:15,554 --> 00:23:16,970
Don't be silly!

438
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:19,679
If you wanna stop, you just gotta have the motivation!

439
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:21,220
I don't understand how motivation

440
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:24,262
has anything to do with constant involuntary sneezing.

441
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:26,720
Hmm...

442
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:29,220
Sometimes, you just gotta do it!

443
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:30,512
No way.

444
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:34,387
What a complete idiot.
