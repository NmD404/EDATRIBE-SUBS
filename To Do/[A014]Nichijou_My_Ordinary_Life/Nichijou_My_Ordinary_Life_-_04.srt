1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,561
I've noticed some unruly behavior

2
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:08,395
among the students as of late.

3
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:10,811
And since you are the school's guidance counselor,

4
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:12,895
I trust that you'll be stricter with students

5
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:14,395
and enforce our rules.

6
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:16,270
Of course!

7
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:18,895
Yes! You can count on me!

8
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:51,228
Just trust me, the next time...

9
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,728
That's right!

10
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:54,770
Becoming the guidance counselor was the first step I took

11
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:58,936
to growing as a person! I have to do my best!

12
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:12,395
Oh, my goodness! I can't believe what I'm seeing!

13
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:15,811
Wait, just calm down. You can do this.

14
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:17,103
Um. Excuse me!

15
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:19,895
Uh. What can I do for you, madam?

16
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:23,478
I'm sorry to bother you, but you see, uh, I was thinking

17
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,436
that it might be inappropriate to eat while walking?

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,936
Or something like that.

19
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,936
Apologies!

20
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,936
I skipped breakfast this morning.

21
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,228
And my stomach couldn't wait until lunchtime.

22
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:36,978
But I shall put this away immediately.

23
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:39,436
You mean it? Thank you so much!

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,686
I'm really glad you understand.

25
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,561
That wasn't so bad. All I had to do was speak up.

26
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:49,270
Please tell the chef...

27
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:56,520
...the meal was to die for!

28
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:04,395
If you don't stop making a scene in the hallway,

29
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:05,603
you really will die here,

30
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,686
so quit being such a weirdo at school!

31
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,603
Correct me if I'm wrong,

32
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:11,603
but I don't think those are allowed?

33
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,353
Hey, Misato! We're headed out!

34
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:14,770
Coming!

35
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:18,228
Sasahara! We'll continue this during the lunch break.

36
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,561
Don't you forget it!

37
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:24,020
The principal was right about the unruly behavior.

38
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,561
My apologies.

39
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:28,895
I'm sure she meant no harm.
She tends to be a bit dramatic.

40
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:30,061
Don't mind her.

41
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:34,770
Uh, okay. I guess, if you say so.

42
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:36,895
Oh! One more thing!

43
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:37,470
Question.

44
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:40,895
What do you call that frilly
piece of cloth around your neck?

45
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,478
Ah, you mean this?

46
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:46,686
Yes, I have to say, it looks rather dashing.

47
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,936
We live our ordinary lives, day after day, in succession.

48
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,561
Each hour can be considered a miracle in itself.

49
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,145
Uh.

50
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:04,103
So, you see. Each moment should be truly savored.

51
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,978
So, uh, you never actually said

52
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:14,436
what that frilly thing was.

53
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,770
Ahh! That's a good one!

54
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,520
Now, then. I bid you <i>adieu,</i> madam.

55
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:44,020
Thank you. I appreciate it.

56
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,936
...Go+Soccer club is a club that plays Go and Soccer.

57
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,686
Both individually, and at the same time.

58
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:55,228
Excuse me, Nakanojou! A moment please?

59
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:57,270
Yes. How can I help you?

60
00:04:57,353 --> 00:05:00,103
Uh, well, you see, thing is...

61
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:01,853
I was just thinking that your haircut

62
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:03,895
might be a little too extreme for school.

63
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,520
Uhh...

64
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,603
Uh. I mean, just by a little bit!

65
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,228
On second thought, it's not all that bad.

66
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,728
It's all I have.

67
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,353
Hey, I'm really sorry if I offended you.

68
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:15,395
I was only saying--

69
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:16,686
My hair.

70
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,478
My hair doesn't grow out on the sides!

71
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:26,520
Green light!

72
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:29,311
Still green light.

73
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,645
Green light...

74
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:34,561
And red light!

75
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:36,853
Everyone went home already.

76
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,603
Um, what are these?

77
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:49,186
Those are green plums.

78
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,520
I thought it might be kind of fun

79
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:53,270
if I tried pickling some of them at home this year.

80
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,145
Pickled plums are so sour.

81
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:57,145
But they're very healthy for you.

82
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:59,270
Plus, if you put them inside of rice balls,

83
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:01,270
it'll keep the rice from going bad.

84
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:03,270
Ah! Yum!

85
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:05,270
Hey, Nano!

86
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:06,686
I think not.

87
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,645
Gah! You say no, but I haven't even asked anything yet!

88
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:12,186
We bought you plenty of snacks
the other day, and I thought

89
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,353
I made it clear that we're not going to buy any more

90
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:18,853
of them until you finish the
ones you already have at home.

91
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,561
Are you listening to me?

92
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:23,020
Remember we came here for a purpose.

93
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:24,895
To shop for... uh...?

94
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:26,311
Sakamoto.

95
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,936
Right. We told Sakamoto that this grocery trip

96
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,561
was to get him food, so we can't get distracted by...

97
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,603
Whoa that's giant.

98
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:38,645
Um, 'Scuse me.

99
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:40,728
Yes? Anything I can help you with?

100
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:43,353
That thing up there. Is it new?

101
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,645
Yes, our snowman just came in this morning.

102
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:48,811
It's the only one we have in the whole store.

103
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,686
Can I eat it?

104
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,353
Well, I guess it wouldn't be too different

105
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,270
from a shaved ice dessert.

106
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,436
Oh, it's cold!

107
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,103
And cheap, too!

108
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:06,311
Gonna buy it?

109
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:08,978
Uh. No, I was just wondering how much it was!

110
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,520
Check out the snow man.

111
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:11,811
I want it.

112
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:13,770
Uh.

113
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:15,061
Young lady.

114
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:15,978
Yes ma'am?

115
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,770
If you're not going to buy that
snowman, please give it to me.

116
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:29,228
Okay, I'll take it!

117
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,686
So, I don't get to buy anything,

118
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,520
but you can buy whatever you want?
You're such a big meany.

119
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:38,520
Listen. It's not like that.

120
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:40,936
Yes, it is! You wouldn't let me get my favoritest snacks,

121
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,770
but you picked up a snowman just cause he's cute.

122
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:45,895
It's not fair! I wanna buy stuff too!

123
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:48,770
Okay, fine, I give-- you can get one snack.

124
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:51,520
Do you mean it?

125
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:52,811
All right. We're good.

126
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,061
So that's why you ended up buying that thing.

127
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:05,436
Uh-huh! It's cute, it's cold, and I like how it feels.

128
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,145
Hmm...

129
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:11,978
Okey-dokey, here's some more.

130
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,353
Yay!

131
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,811
Nano, I need more snow! Right away!

132
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,645
Coming right up!

133
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:25,353
You two are unbelievable.

134
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:27,936
Anyway, where's the food you got for me?

135
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:30,853
Oh.

136
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:36,478
She forgot my food.

137
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:41,645

Instead, focus on what your own goals are.

181
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:17,811

00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:23,520
Jeez. You two really need to learn some manners.

184
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,936
You've got no respect.

185
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,603
Sorry, Sakamoto. I'm not doing it on purpose.

186
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:30,228
Could you, for once, add the "mister"?

187
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,561
Want some gum? Would that help, Sakamoto?

188
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,103
How many times do I have to tell you

189
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,645
before you get it through your thick skull?

190
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:38,895
And what makes you think you can give gum to a cat--?

191
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:46,103
Would you cut it out?

192
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:47,436
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,145
Listen up. As I've explained before,

194
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,395
I'm older than you in human and in cat years.

195
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:55,645
And as your elder, I deserve respect...

196
00:13:55,728 --> 00:14:00,353
in the... form... of... the title "mister"...

197
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:03,020
So, uh...

198
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,103
You gotta... do the thing.

199
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:07,936
You know... what I said before... about the...

200
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,895
...you know, name and the...

201
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:11,603
What?

202
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,478
Can I go and use the potty?

203
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,770
Yeah! Sure! Go ahead!

204
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:20,811
Potty time!

205
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,770
And she took it with her.

206
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,186
As I suspected,

207
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,603
those two kids are the only ones living in this place.

208
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,395
Now I get it.

209
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:38,561
That explains why they're so undisciplined.

210
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,561
So, if I'm older than both of them,

211
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:46,478
I guess that means I'm the oldest in the entire house.

212
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:49,853
Heh. So be it. Seems like I'll have to step in

213
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:52,520
as the parental figure they're lacking.

214
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:56,686
Hm? This is quite the unusual family

215
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,020
I've been brought into.

216
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:01,520
Oh man, this thing is so much fun!

217
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:05,561
Hey, Sakamoto. What are you up to?

218
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:08,728
Crap! If she finds out

219
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:13,270
I was playing with an eraser,
she'll lose her respect for me!

220
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:18,228
The respect I worked so hard for.

221
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,061
I was, uh, taking a nap?

222
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:27,561
Cats sure do sleep a lot.

223
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:29,811
Anyway, that's the way things are.

224
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,270
The way things are?

225
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:33,478
Yup. Now you're getting it.

226
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:35,978
You've gotta get a grip on the basics first.

227
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:40,770
Like... learning how to respect... your... el... ders!

228
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:42,811
Oh man! This is so much fun!

229
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:48,895
Ah! Sakamoto! Do it again!

230
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:50,478
Do it again! Come on, the jump flip!

231
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,103
Hey! Don't forget the basics!

232
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,686
I told you to call me "mister" Sakamoto!

233
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,645
I'm home!

234
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:57,561
Hooray!

235
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:33,186
Don't you ever knock, Mom!

236
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,561
Green light!

237
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,811
Red light!

238
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:51,853
Green light!

239
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,686
It's like she begging me to make a joke

240
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,895
about how she's reading weird stuff.

241
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:05,686
Well, I guess I'll take the bait.

242
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,936
That book your reading is going undercover!

243
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,270
Yuuko.

244
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:13,936
Please don't ever make a joke like that one again.

245
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,228
Uhh...

246
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:18,020
The jokes you make are always so good.

247
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:22,103
My own aren't nearly as funny when compared to your jokes.

248
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,270
Uhh...

249
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:29,311
Well, I don't always come up with the jokes on my own!

250
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,228
Sometimes, the jokes come up with me!

251
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:33,103
Y'know! Like just now when you had your books

252
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,936
stacked up weird, it's almost like you were asking for it!

253
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,395
But, like. Thing is...

254
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,770
I wasn't sure you'd think it was funny.

255
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:42,353
Really, you weren't sure?

256
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,645
Are you being honest when you say that?

257
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:47,270
Uh? Huh...?

258
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:49,770
I figured that you would understand.

259
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:51,145
Huh?

260
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:52,478
I thought you'd catch on

261
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:55,103
to what I was doing since you're so intelligent.

262
00:17:58,395 --> 00:18:00,103
I had no idea you saw me in that way!

263
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:02,020
I mean, I'm flattered you think so highly of me!

264
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:03,603
And it's so good to know there's someone out there

265
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:05,270
who thinks I'm trustworthy.

266
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:06,853
Trustworthy?

267
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:11,811
I'd rather not bring trust into this.

268
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:14,603
And I don't think we should speak to each other.

269
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:17,603
After all, we aren't friends anymore.

270
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:18,728
Hm?

271
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:22,478
We're best friends.

272
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,936
We don't need words to convey our feelings.

273
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,728
You mean it?

274
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,936
Come on! Don't be silly!

275
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,103
Even though we're best friends, we can still talk, right?

276
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,645
But... Mai...

277
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:47,145
I would prefer it if you didn't touch me so frequently.

278
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:48,978
Uh. Um.

279
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,853
All right then.

280
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:52,645
Sorry.

281
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,395
Please stop it.

282
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:58,353
You keep saying things like that and I can't help it.

283
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:59,770
Huh?

284
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:03,853
I can't stop myself from liking you even more.

285
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:10,811
Huh...?!

286
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:14,353
Um, uh, hey, it's not a big deal!

287
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,311
Of course you like me! Because we're friends!

288
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:17,603
Best friends, right?

289
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:19,061
High-Five!

290
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,228
No, it's not like that at all.

291
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:22,311
Huh?

292
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,186
I do like you as a friend,

293
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,353
but I also like you like you as more than that.

294
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:36,520
Sorry. I just... can't really explain it.

295
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:41,561
Well, I... That's, uh...

296
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,478
What the heck is going on?

297
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:50,728
I knew something was up!

298
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:52,478
She's talking way more than usual!

299
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:54,228
Come to think of it, she was the one who suggested

300
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:55,770
that we go somewhere alone today!

301
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,978
Did she want to confess her feelings?

302
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:01,645
But why, and since when?

303
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:04,020
How long has she felt this way?

304
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:09,228
Hey, uh, Mai, I just have a little something to clear up.

305
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:13,936
Uh. The thing is, I don't know what to say!

306
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,353
This is all happening so fast,

307
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:17,395
and we're both so young, and we're only in high school!

308
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:19,353
We've got our whole lives ahead of us!

309
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,103
I think we might be rushing into things!

310
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,228
You know that I was just kidding, right?

311
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:26,936
That was super, ultra, great, delicious, wonderfully

312
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,603
hard to understand!

313
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,061
Why would you do that?!

314
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:33,978
You totally had me going there!

315
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:36,895
Now you're saying it was all a joke?!

316
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:38,145
I see.

317
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:39,603
Uh...?

318
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,686
You're usually so perceptive to these kinds of things,

319
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,353
so I was expecting that you would figure out

320
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:44,978
what I was up to and play along.

321
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:46,395
Well, I...

322
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,978
I had a feeling you were up to something.

323
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:50,936
You're a liar.

324
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,686
Not exactly. I knew that something was off,

325
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,186
it just took time for my brain to process the signs.

326
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,686
I almost had you figured out, too.

327
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,645
You ended up dropping the act before I could put it

328
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,978
all together and start playing off of you.

329
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,061
Didn't you just say that I totally had you going earlier?

330
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:07,353
Huh?

331
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:09,228
I hate being lied to more than anything,

332
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,811
so you can stop making excuses.

333
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,270
Uh...

334
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:16,103
Sorry.

335
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:18,186
Chill out I'm still just joking with you.

336
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,353
I don't even know what to believe anymore!

337
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:22,811
So you didn't notice then?

338
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:24,978
You couldn't catch the other joke I made?

339
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:29,811
I don't care, just tell me what it was!

340
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:31,645
It was at the very beginning when I said

341
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,853
I thought you were smart.

342
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:37,270
You went along with it,
so I just kept on messing with you.

343
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:41,228
That was why?!

344
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:45,770
Well, at least I can understand
why you made that first joke.

345
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:27,561
It's me!

346
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:29,686
Your friendly neighborhood apartment complex!

347
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,936
Can you believe I'm over 40 years old now?

348
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,145
I guess you could call me the land lady.

349
00:23:34,228 --> 00:23:36,561
That's got a raunchy ring to it, doesn't it?

350
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:39,478
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 5.

351
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:40,895
Look forward to it!
