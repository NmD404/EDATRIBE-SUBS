1
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:07,162
Nano Shinonome.

2
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:10,495
I've used every single trapping trick I have up my sleeve.

3
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,203
Since you still remain out of my reach,

4
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:14,078
your system has to be far more advanced

5
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:15,245
than I initially thought,

6
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:17,245
and I must know what makes you tick!

7
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:18,662
For science!

8
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:21,037
Unfortunately, my various attempts at capturing you

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,787
have garnered some unwanted attention at school.

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,328
I must tread carefully.

11
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:26,370
Hm?

12
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:31,578
Could that be...?

13
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,370
Wait!

14
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,245
Come back!

15
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,620
Don't you walk away from me!

16
00:00:46,662 --> 00:00:49,870
Me-Meow!

17
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:51,287
Thanks for the food!

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,662
Wait for your father to get here first!

19
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:55,203
Aww!

20
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:01,495
Hey, Sis, have you seen the remote?

21
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:03,870
I think I saw it next to the kettle.

22
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:08,537
Meow?

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,578
Hm?

24
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:12,828
That's the wrong cat.

25
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:15,203
Who's out here snooping around at this hour?

26
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:16,203
The heck are you doing?

27
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:17,578
Is that a thief?

28
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,870
Not good!

29
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:21,620
Hey, lady! What's the matter with you?

30
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:04,662
Hm?

31
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:07,370
Huh. It's Nano.

32
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:12,245
Thank you very much for the help.

33
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:13,828
Those books look heavy.

34
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:14,953
Not at all.

35
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:16,870
But I appreciate the assistance.

36
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:19,370
Mm. It was the least I could do.

37
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,287
Mio! Hey! Guess what I just saw!

38
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,537
Can you tell me later? I'm busy.

39
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,912
It can't wait until later!

40
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:30,287
I have to tell you about it right now!

41
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,620
'Kay, go.

42
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:33,453
I just caught Nano and Koujirou walking together

43
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:35,745
out in the hallway!

44
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,537
And?

45
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,787
Huh?

46
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,412
That's weird.

47
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:45,037
I thought she would totally freak out over this.

48
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:47,953
So?

49
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,453
Uhh.

50
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:54,412
Hmm.

51
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,245
So!

52
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:59,537
They, uh, were being all polite to each other!

53
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,828
Hmm.

54
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,287
Doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary to me.

55
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,328
Huh?

56
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,620
People talk to other people.

57
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:08,037
That stuff happens all the time.

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,120
So, yeah. Is that it?

59
00:04:10,203 --> 00:04:11,662
Um, guess so.

60
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:12,953
That's all I got.

61
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:14,620
All right, well, I've gotta finish this report

62
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:15,870
before the next class.

63
00:04:15,953 --> 00:04:17,162
So, you know.

64
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,162
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop distracting me.

65
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:21,495
'Kay, sure. Sorry.

66
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,537
Well, dang. That was a buzzkill.

67
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,578
So?

68
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,662
Huh?

69
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:28,828
And then?

70
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:29,870
What happened? After?

71
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:33,578
After what?

72
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:34,662
After you saw those two

73
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:37,078
being all buddy-buddy with each other.

74
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:38,245
Well?

75
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,745
You were so chatty just a second ago.

76
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:42,120
Well, um, he, uh...

77
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:43,495
Koujirou told Nano that he thought

78
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:46,162
her big stack of books looked really heavy.

79
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,662
And then?

80
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,995
And... then that's it.

81
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:57,037
Oh, my gosh, Yuuko!

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,828
You are so silly, you know that?

83
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:01,370
I always knew you were a total goofball,

84
00:05:01,453 --> 00:05:04,953
but all of your crazy talk really cracked me up this time!

85
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,287
I can't believe you made such a big deal out of this!

86
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,912
You can be such a little dummy-dumb!

87
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:11,703
It's kinda crazy how clueless you can be!

88
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:13,037
It's fine 'cause you're dumb!

89
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,287
Ya idiot!

90
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:18,453
I guess I forgot to mention that after they talked,

91
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:20,953
Koujirou and Nano started making out.

92
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,703
What? No way.

93
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,412
You're kidding. How could that even happen?

94
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,078
Well, it started off with a little bit of smooching

95
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:34,328
here and there,

96
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:35,912
then they went to the cafeteria for a snack,

97
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:37,120
if you know what I mean.

98
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,703
Turns out it was an actual snack,

99
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:41,245
'cause they bought some bread,
but one thing led to another...

100
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:42,787
...snd suddenly, Koujirou...

101
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,162
Koujirou what?

102
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,037
He took his clothes off outta nowhere!

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,745
He took off his clothes?

104
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:49,828
And then he mentioned that wanted to

105
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:51,328
get his hands on something "delicious,"

106
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,703
so Koujirou decided to make his move.

107
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:54,537
What move?

108
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,703
In the courtyard.

109
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:56,787
The courtyard?

110
00:05:58,828 --> 00:05:59,995
I totally forgot that I gotta

111
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:02,037
do that report thing before class, too!

112
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,537
Aw, crap!

113
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,912
We have to come up with our own subject

114
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:06,162
for this stupid assignment?

115
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:07,745
But what happened?

116
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:09,203
In the courtyard...

117
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,078
What did they do?

118
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:17,370
Ah? You decided to get the <i>yakisoba</i> bread again, I see.

119
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:20,078
So what? It's my favorite!

120
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,245
You sure do love that bread, don't you?

121
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:25,620
Looks like you're the Yakisoba Princess.

122
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:26,870
Well, uh...

123
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,203
What kind of bread did you buy then?

124
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,245
Me?

125
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:32,245
I bought a sweet roll.

126
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:34,162
Then... does that make him...?

127
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:35,453
Hm? What's wrong?

128
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:38,662
It's none of your business, so there! Hmph!

129
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:40,828
Does that mean... I should call him...

130
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:42,787
...the Sweet Roll Prince?

131
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:51,287
How delicious!

132
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,078
Then... does that make him...?

133
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,787
Hm? What's wrong?

134
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,328
It's none of your business, so there! Hmph.

135
00:06:58,412 --> 00:07:00,578
So then... does that mean...

136
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:04,412
...I should call him... the Silky-Skinned Beauty?

137
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:05,703
Let's eat in the courtyard!

138
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:07,162
What a splendid idea.

139
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:08,828
And then I heard the teacher ate a whale

140
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:10,245
that was caught in the wild!

141
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:12,287
Ha! That's preposterous!

142
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,120
I'm telling the truth!

143
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:14,995
But, if that's the case,

144
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,495
it means they went outside of

145
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:19,412
the established 200 nautical mile exclusive fishing zone.

146
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:20,912
Oh, that's no problem at all,

147
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:23,078
because the teacher is actually an Inuit!

148
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:25,828
Nano.

149
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:26,995
Hmm?

150
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:28,703
There's a crumb on your cheek.

151
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:30,953
Let me get that for you.

152
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:38,870
It was like a gentle moment

153
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:41,495
floating on the soft spring breeze.

154
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:42,703
Our moment.

155
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:44,037
in the courtyard.

156
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,537
Our rendezvous.

157
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,745
Rendezvous!

158
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:50,912
How am I supposed to focus like this?

159
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:52,828
I can't stop thinking about those two!

160
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:54,120
I have to know!

161
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,203
Yuuko!

162
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:58,078
I was just about to think of a topic!

163
00:07:58,162 --> 00:07:59,162
Tell me what happened

164
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,328
between those two in the courtyard!

165
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:03,120
Will you stop yelling at me?

166
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:03,995
Let's see.

167
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:05,328
They were, uh...

168
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:07,953
You're useless!

169
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:10,703
Fine then! I'll have to find out myself!

170
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:13,912
I'll go to the Courtyard of Eden!

171
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,870
Thank you again for your help.

172
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:19,828
It was my pleasure.

173
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:20,995
Farewell.

174
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:29,078
Huh? Mio, are you okay?

175
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,370
Why are you on the floor?

176
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:31,245
Nano.

177
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:32,662
Yes?

178
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,078
I heard that you were eating <i>yakisoba</i> bread

179
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,995
with Koujirou out in the courtyard.

180
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:38,370
And who is Koujirou? Uh--

181
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:42,537
Uh--oh, you mean that guy?

182
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,745
All he did was help me pick up

183
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:45,495
one of the books I dropped earlier.

184
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:47,453
And that's it?

185
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:49,495
Yup. That's all that happened.

186
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:52,078
But... what happened to the <i>yakisoba</i> bread?

187
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:54,162
Huh? What are you talking about?

188
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:07,828
Helvetica Standard.

189
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:08,912
Hey!

190
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,203
Come on, you can trust me!

191
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,578
Just tell me who you like, Yumi!

192
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:12,787
Aww.

193
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,078
I dunno if I should.

194
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:15,328
I won't tell anybody,

195
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:17,578
but if I do, I'll give ya a million yen! 'Kay?

196
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:18,787
All right.

197
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,453
But you better not tell anyone, you promise?

198
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:23,412
Yeah, totes!

199
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:24,745
It's Takashi.

200
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:26,162
Hey, everyone, listen up!

201
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:28,703
Yumi just told me that she likes Takashi!

202
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:47,995
Fascinating.

203
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:58,453
--Ha! --Head!

204
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:08,287
Thank you for all your help today.

205
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,620
Take this.

206
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:10,578
Huh?

207
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:20,620
That stupid prodigy!

208
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:25,620
It's so rare for you stop by the dojo nowadays.

209
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:26,912
With the competition coming up,

210
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:28,370
it's good to get some extra lessons

211
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:29,828
with our instructor outside of school,

212
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,245
so I can be ready.

213
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:32,453
And having Yoshino there

214
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:34,578
also helps out with my training a lot, too.

215
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:37,078
You're lucky, because she usually never shows up.

216
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,703
What? She doesn't?

217
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:40,578
She told me she actually starts to get worse

218
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:41,787
the harder she trains.

219
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,953
Like some kendo freak of nature.

220
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:46,287
So, if you don't learn from her,

221
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,328
who do you normally get your lessons from?

222
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:49,912
The instructor.

223
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:53,828
And Sasahara has also been
coming to the dojo a lot lately.

224
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:54,912
Hmm.

225
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:58,453
Sasahara?!

226
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:00,287
Since when does he go to the dojo?

227
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,703
Since always?

228
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,495
He was going there throughout all of middle school,

229
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:05,037
so it's really nothing new.

230
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,620
Yeah, but, well, I... I guess that's true.

231
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:09,870
I don't get why you're making such a big deal.

232
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:11,453
Aren't you in the same kendo club?

233
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:12,578
The one at school!

234
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,037
No, we are not!

235
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,495
He's been in the drama club ever since his first year.

236
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,370
Hmm?

237
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:20,037
Wha?!

238
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,912
He's part of the drama club?

239
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:24,620
Why isn't he in the kendo club?

240
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:26,162
How the heck am I supposed to know?

241
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,620
If you take a weird guy like him

242
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,037
out of something cool like kendo,

243
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,370
all you're left with is a weird dude!

244
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:33,203
You don't know Sasahara like I do,

245
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:35,078
'cause you've only ever seen him at the dojo.

246
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,745
What do you mean?

247
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:39,037
I mean that his performances in the drama club

248
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,412
are a bit out there,

249
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:41,703
but they're honestly pretty unique and interesting.

250
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:43,078
Don't be silly. This is grape juice.

251
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:44,995
I guess I can imagine that.

252
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:46,162
So, you get it?

253
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:47,662
What I don't get is why you haven't just

254
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:49,703
invited him to the kendo club yet.

255
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:50,953
It's such a waste!

256
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:51,715
What?

257
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,495
Why do I have to be the one to invite him to the club?

258
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:57,037
I don't think about him. He can do whatever he wants.

259
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,412
But I bet you guys could totally

260
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:00,453
make it to nationals together with his help!

261
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:01,787
Don't hold your breath.

262
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,703
He ran off and joined that stupid little drama club

263
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,078
of his own accord.

264
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:08,078
Who cares? I don't! That idiot!

265
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:10,120
But if you insist...

266
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:12,662
There's no need to twist my arm.

267
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:15,370
Maybe I can invite him for your sake.

268
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:17,912
Oh, wow.

269
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:20,412
I can read her like a book.

270
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:21,662
--So? --Huh?

271
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:23,495
When does Sasahara come to the dojo?

272
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,328
Uh--

273
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,328
Well, he stops by every three days or so,

274
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:30,828
so I get the feeling that he'll probably be there tomorrow.

275
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:32,912
Mm...

276
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:34,537
'Kay, whatever. It's not like I care.

277
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:37,412
Hey, Sis.

278
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:38,787
What?

279
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,953
You should just confess your feelings to him already!

280
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:45,787
I don't wanna hear it from someone younger than me!

281
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,078
I'm going home!

282
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:53,953
Sis. You're so transparent.

283
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,787
It's freezing!

284
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:13,537
Icy hand attack!

285
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:16,620
See ya!

286
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:36,578
Fascinating.

287
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,870
Yuck.

288
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:43,703
Mm!

289
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,995
Ahh, so yummy!

290
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,703
Thank you for all of the food!

291
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:54,493
Hakase!

292
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:56,995
You need finish those green
onions you flicked to the side!

293
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:58,578
I think it's still a bit too early

294
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,703
for me to eat green onions right now.

295
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:02,537
What is that supposed to mean?

296
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,078
Regardless,

297
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:06,328
you should finish every bit of food that's on your plate.

298
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,870
But the green stuff is always bitter,

299
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:09,578
and gross, and weird, and whatever.

300
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,620
If you don't finish your food,

301
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:13,328
then you don't get snacks tomorrow.

302
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,828
Just look at Sakamoto and follow his example.

303
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:17,495
He eats his food no matter what--

304
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:23,162
Sorry. I'm just not feeling it.

305
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,495
Oh, no! What happened?

306
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:27,578
Aw, come here, kitty! Are you doing all right?

307
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:29,453
I'm fine. It's just a little cold.

308
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,495
I'll sleep it off--

309
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:33,870
You'll have a hard time recovering if you don't eat.

310
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:35,203
Can you at least give it a try?

311
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,870
I think I'll pass.

312
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:38,537
Would it help if I got you some milk?

313
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,787
Don't think so.

314
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,662
Then I'm at a loss.

315
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:43,787
Do you feel like eating anything at all?

316
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,037
Not really.

317
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
I don't even wanna think about it.

318
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,370
Oh, no.

319
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:51,578
Here, Sakamoto, you can have my green onions.

320
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:53,120
Ya tryin' to kill me?!

321
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,203
Ooh.

322
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:09,328
Are you sure there's nothing I can get for you?

323
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:10,995
Yeah.

324
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,620
Then I'll just leave this milk right here

325
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,203
in case you change your mind.

326
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:18,245
If you need anything at all, let me know, okay?

327
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:19,703
Sure.

328
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:25,537
I think I'm coming down with a cough,

329
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,870
so can you get me some chocolate?

330
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:27,870
Please and thank you.

331
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:29,578
Only if you eat your green onions.

332
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,162
Why does Sakamoto get offered stuff for free

333
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,495
but I don't?

334
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:35,203
Because Sakamoto's sick and needs the help.

335
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:37,620
Well, I'm coughing over here, so I can be sick, too!

336
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,662
Sick people usually aren't this energetic.

337
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:42,037
I just really want chocolate and it's pumping me up!

338
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,828
I can be sick and excited at the same time!

339
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:45,037
If you're actually sick,

340
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,620
then you have to take some medicine.

341
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:49,037
So, do you wanna take medicine?

342
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,453
Forget it!

343
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:53,412
Wait, Hakase!

344
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,245
Did you put yourself in timeout?

345
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,995
Leave me alone!

346
00:15:57,078 --> 00:15:58,703
You hate me, so that's why you're being mean

347
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,495
and making me eat those yucky green onions!

348
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:01,912
And you like Sakamoto more

349
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,162
because you're not making him eat any onions at all!

350
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,203
Wait, I don't think you understand.

351
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:07,370
Cats can't eat onions.

352
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:08,870
It's toxic for them.

353
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:10,828
Well, how was I supposed to know that?!

354
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:14,370
You're so silly.

355
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:19,453
If I'm being honest, I actually like you the most.

356
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:22,620
Is that true?

357
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:23,662
You betcha!

358
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,703
So can I have chocolate now since you like me most?

359
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,412
Lemme think.

360
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:31,287
I'll let you have it if you eat your onions.

361
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,078
What? No fair!

362
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,787
You're being the worst most-liker of me ever right now!

363
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,037
Then maybe I'll just go like Sakamoto the most.

364
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,287
Can you make up your mind already?

365
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,745
Okay, I choose both of you!

366
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:46,495
That doesn't count, Sakamoto!

367
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:26,078
Which floor would you like?

368
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:29,203
The seventh floor, please, if you wouldn't mind.

369
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,828
The thing is,

370
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:38,870
I don't remember feeling embarrassed this year.

371
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,787
Now then.

372
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,245
Let's talk about your hopes and dreams for the future.

373
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:49,912
Hmm.

374
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:58,953
A manga artist.

375
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,162
Um, that's right.

376
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:03,828
Your drawings have always been excellent,

377
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:04,912
so this is great!

378
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:06,745
Huh? Well...

379
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:08,203
I believe in your skills.

380
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,287
So, feel free to chase your dreams.

381
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,245
I wish you the best of luck!

382
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:14,953
Hmm?

383
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:28,162
Let's see, Yuuko wanted the melon juice,

384
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:30,328
but what do I wanna drink?

385
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,245
Well, money is pretty tight this month,

386
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,037
so I probably shouldn't get anything fancy.

387
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,203
Just stick with the usual banana juice.

388
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,078
Oh! Wait! Don't roll away!

389
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,078
Sorry about that--

390
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,203
Wait. No. Yes? Yes! No!

391
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,078
It's him!

392
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:55,787
Koujirou's right in front of me!

393
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,412
I hope I didn't startle you.

394
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,328
You're practically a deer in headlights right now.

395
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:04,912
No! You're fine and I'm fine and sorry!

396
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:05,745
Mm.

397
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,037
Come on!

398
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,412
Talk about something.

399
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:09,828
Anything at all!

400
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,620
So, uh...

401
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:14,453
The weather sure is nice today, isn't it?

402
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:16,953
Wait! No it isn't, you idiot!

403
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:19,953
See? The sky's all gray and gloomy!

404
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:27,745
That was rich.

405
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,078
Yeah.

406
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:31,620
By the way, miss, might this coin belong to you?

407
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,578
Uh, yes!

408
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:35,787
Is that right?

409
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,787
Well, this is certainly a surprise.

410
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,578
Huh? 'Kay, sure.

411
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:42,370
Perhaps I was fated to come across you and this coin.

412
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:43,495
Huh?

413
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:44,953
This just so happens to be the only day

414
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:47,412
I've forgotten to bring my wallet with me to school.

415
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:49,662
And right as my throat was becoming parched,

416
00:19:49,745 --> 00:19:52,287
I was conveniently walking near a vending machine.

417
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,120
And lo, I picked up this coin.

418
00:19:57,578 --> 00:20:01,037
The heavens... are shining down on me.

419
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:03,828
In a way,

420
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,995
the drink I'm to receive is like ambrosia,

421
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:08,870
passed down to me directly from on high.

422
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:19,453
Um...

423
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:34,995
This vending machine...

424
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,120
Huh! Looks like it can be quite the prankster!

425
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,078
Oh! Yeah!

426
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:42,578
To think.

427
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:45,078
A simple dispenser of drinks managed to get the best me.

428
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,453
Must be a bold contraption

429
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,912
to be able to pull off such an admirable feat.

430
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:50,120
I like it!

431
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:53,120
You deserve my coin, you dastardly device!

432
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,620
Uh, Koujirou?

433
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:10,453
Shh.

434
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:44,287
I don't really know why, but...

435
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,453
...I feel like I've gotten a little closer to him.

436
00:21:49,078 --> 00:21:51,787
Mio! Where's my juice?

437
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:10,287
I wonder if she was trying to tell me something.

438
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,162
Yoshino is so strong and skilled,

439
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:14,745
she's practically unstoppable.

440
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:17,620
The Knight.

441
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,203
What does it mean?

442
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:20,537
What do I do with it?

443
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,120
Confess your feelings already!

444
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:26,162
Hey, Sis, the bath is free now.

445
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:27,078
Uh--

446
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,078
I wonder.

447
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:43,870
Is Koujirou looking at the moon right now, too?

448
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:45,953
Sasahara!

449
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:47,662
You're not half bad, y'know!

450
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:50,328
You should come back and train with me sometime!

451
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:51,162
Mm.

452
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,203
Cool!

453
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:56,495
I might even teach you my secret move next time!

454
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:03,162
Sis!

455
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:05,787
Look, what's that over there?

456
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,745
Hm?

457
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:09,620
Sisters!

458
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:13,620
Don't barge into my room and scare me like that!

459
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:15,662
I wasn't interrupting a special moment, was I?

460
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,162
No, of course not!

461
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:21,078
Don't worry about it!

462
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:22,828
Are you blushing?

463
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:24,287
No! I'm not!

464
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,953
Just leave me alone!

465
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,912
I'm a vending machine,

466
00:24:57,995 --> 00:24:59,245
and here's my MO.

467
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:01,328
When you're low on cash and need a snack,

468
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,453
we'll eat your change and won't give it back!

469
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,037
Respect my law!

470
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,578
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 25.

471
00:25:08,662 --> 00:25:10,245
Look forward to it!
