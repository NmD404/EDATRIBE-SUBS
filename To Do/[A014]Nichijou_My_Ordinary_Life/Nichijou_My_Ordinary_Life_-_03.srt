1
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:18,297
Hey, can I ask you something?

2
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:19,381
Yeah, of course.

3
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:21,422
Not that this is necessarily a bad thing,

4
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:24,172
but why do you wear those exact same hair ties every day?

5
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:25,589
Oh, you mean these?

6
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:27,589
Hm... 'Cause I wanna.

7
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:28,797
Sure, but why though?

8
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:31,089
There's no real reason, it's just my thing.

9
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:32,089
Okay...

10
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,297
Aw man, I forgot my math notebook.

11
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:40,797
Hang on! We have a math class today?

12
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:43,631
Of course we do! That's why we had homework for it.

13
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:45,297
I'm gonna run back and grab my stuff.

14
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:46,672
You go ahead!

15
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:50,047
Well. I didn't do that homework, anyway,

16
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:52,589
so none of this matters to me.

17
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:56,672
Oh! Hey, Mai!

18
00:02:58,297 --> 00:03:00,339
<i>Selamat pagi</i> !

19
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:11,297
Well, well, well, look who it is!

20
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,839
It's my bestest pal herself!

21
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:16,006
You've finally come to grace me with your presence, huh?

22
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:18,922
You sure do take things to a whole 'nother level, dontcha?

23
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:20,881
Y'know! Like a mountain!

24
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:24,714
Tell me! What's it like being
an actual real-life mountain?

25
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:29,464
Well, I guess she doesn't like

26
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,422
being called a mountain.

27
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,089
I get it.

28
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:04,381
You're mad at me.

29
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:06,756
And I think I understand why.

30
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,589
Yesterday I stole a bite of broccoli from your lunch.

31
00:04:09,672 --> 00:04:10,881
The last piece.

32
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:13,089
And now you're angry.

33
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,381
But don't worry.

34
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,839
I got you a new thing of broccoli!

35
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,589
You shoulda told me that you liked it so much

36
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,089
before I shoved it in my mouth!

37
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:22,256
But we can put all that behind us, now, 'cause you've got

38
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:26,839
a new broccoli! So, there we go. Problem solved!

39
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:28,714
Anyway, my old man flipped the channel

40
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:31,964
just as fast as he could.

41
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:39,506
It's not about the broccoli then.

42
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,381
Maybe the cauliflower?

43
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,922
Probably not.

44
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:56,756
I've done so many potentially offensive things,

45
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,214
I don't even know which one she'd be mad at me for!

46
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:05,464
Although, there is one thing that does stand out.

47
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:09,131
I'll have to bite the bullet and apologize.

48
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:11,631
I don't want her to stay mad at me forever!

49
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:12,964
Okay!

50
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,964
Hey, Mai! Listen!

51
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,339
Sorry for eating your main dish!

52
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:25,006
And for stealing your apple bunny!

53
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:26,172
And your rice!

54
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,631
And for leaving the beans!

55
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,756
Oh, come on!

56
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,464
Why are you so mad at me?

57
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:34,714
That's all I can think of!

58
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:37,464
If it's not your lunch, then what is it?

59
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:40,881
Maybe it's because of what happened that one time!

60
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:44,422
When that Buddha statue was on your desk.

61
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:47,422
Is it because I accidently snapped its head off?

62
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:50,881
Or that I took it home and did a crappy job at fixing it?

63
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:54,922
U-Uh!

64
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:58,922
Was it because I buried it and had a secret funeral?

65
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:01,089
Or because I changed my mind, dug it back up,

66
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:04,422
and left a memorial on your desk?

67
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:05,964
Or because I changed my mind again

68
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,256
and decided to cremate it instead?

69
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,214
Well?

70
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:11,714
Help me out! I'm dying here!

71
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:25,422
Ah. Okay, so you were just listening to music

72
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:26,547
this whole time.

73
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:29,006
You couldn't hear anything, could you?

74
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,256
It's no problem, since I really was just talking

75
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,589
to myself anyway, so you didn't really miss much!

76
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:35,172
Man, that was a close one.

77
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:38,089
I almost spilled every bean I had to her.

78
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:40,339
--That last part. --Huh?

79
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:41,714
Buddha.

80
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:43,047
I didn't know.

81
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,589
Excuse me, Tanaka?

82
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:55,047
I'm sorry, but do you have a moment?

83
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,547
Well. Uh.

84
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,297
I just wanted to say that...

85
00:06:58,381 --> 00:06:59,797
It's about your hair.

86
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:02,672
Don't you think it's getting a little big these days?

87
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,047
You know what?

88
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:05,256
Yes?

89
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,089
How 'bout a pancake?

90
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,422
Ah, crap!

91
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,881
I totally forgot I had to do this worksheet!

92
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:22,714
But I still have five minutes until class starts.

93
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:25,797
Mio already let me copy her work yesterday.

94
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,589
I'm begging you!

95
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:32,631
I can't ask her again!

96
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:35,631
That means, I have no choice.

97
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,089
Hey, uh, Mai?

98
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:40,422
So, this is totally embarrassing.

99
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:41,714
But I kinda, sorta,

100
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:44,256
completely forgot to do today's math homework.

101
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,839
Do you think it'd be possible if
I could take the quickest little

102
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:48,131
peek at yours before class starts?

103
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:49,047
Kay.

104
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,214
Oh, wow, really? Thanks!

105
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:54,922
Just gimme one sec! I'll have it copied in no time!

106
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,089
This sucks! I'm so late!

107
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,089
This sucks! This sucks!

108
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:01,714
Don't make such a racket in the morning, Masao!

109
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:02,631
This sucks!

110
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:04,381
I'm so frickin' late!

111
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:06,797
Oh, yeah? Well, I just got laid off!

112
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:14,089
Well, isn't that something.

113
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:16,464
Sorry Mai, but I think you might have given me

114
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:19,881
the wrong paper by mistake, because...

115
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,714
I'll buy you some juice!

116
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:28,547
Here.

117
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:29,714
Thanks so much!

118
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:31,047
I'm so late for school!

119
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:34,506
My dad just got laid off! It sucks for both of us!

120
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:37,922
Wait! The heck is that?!

121
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:38,964
Look behind you, Masao!

122
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:40,464
You've got way bigger problems now!

123
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,297
What are you gonna do?

124
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:44,589
Uh. I mean...

125
00:08:44,672 --> 00:08:46,047
I've got bigger problems!

126
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:48,297
Why am I getting caught up in this weirdo comic?!

127
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:49,672
I can't get distracted!

128
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:53,172
I'll throw in an extra snack if you help me!

129
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:54,422
Here.

130
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:56,297
You're the best! All right, yeah, cool.

131
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:59,464
That's what I'm talkin' about. I knew you had it in you.

132
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:02,214
You didn't have to mess with me like that, you big tease!

133
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:04,797
Anyway, time to knock this thing out!

134
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:15,839
I don't even have today's worksheet. Oh, well.

135
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,506
I want to go to New Orleans.

136
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:34,881
So. Anyone know the solution?

137
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:37,589
Not a single person?

138
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:40,339
Mr. Akagi's class is the worst thing ever.

139
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,839
You get bonked on the head if you forget your homework,

140
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:46,256
and get yelled at for answering a question wrong.

141
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,631
Remember that a lack of in-class participation

142
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,547
will negatively affect your grade.

143
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:54,381
So that's how he's gonna play it.

144
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:58,297
Well, it'll take more than that to trap me, sir!

145
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:02,714
Now, what to do?

146
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:05,589
I guess since today is the 23rd, let's go with

147
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,964
the student assigned to seat number 23.

148
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:08,964
Not me!

149
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:10,756
Nakanojou!

150
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:11,589
Huh, he's absent?

151
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:13,631
What?!

152
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:17,006
Ohh! An arm cramp!

153
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:22,381
Of all times to be stuck like this.

154
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:28,547
Oh no, he might actually call on
me now that I can't back down.

155
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,256
I've gotta hide in the blind spot of his laser eyes.

156
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,547
Just gonna--

157
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:35,714
I'll pretend it was the chair!

158
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:37,131
Give it a little scoot.

159
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:40,006
Hey! I think maybe somebody's phone was just ringing.

160
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,547
Vibrate only!

161
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,047
Let's just hope that they have a "smart phone."

162
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,797
Get it?

163
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,089
Looks like you kids are in a great mood for math!

164
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:53,381
Right?

165
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,047
Uh, so, anyway, moving on.

166
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:18,756
Miss Aioi.

167
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,839
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

168
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:30,589
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

169
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:31,714
Ready!

170
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:34,089
And lift off!

171
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:35,172
Woosh!

172
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:37,006
Why though?

173
00:11:57,756 --> 00:12:00,381
Okay. I already bought sugar and milk,

174
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:02,047
so I can mark those off the list.

175
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:03,922
But I feel like I'm forgetting something important.

176
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:06,297
Did you see that insane sale on eggs today?

177
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:08,714
Yeah, I don't have that much room in my fridge, but...

178
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:11,006
Wait that's right! There was a special on eggs

179
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,714
at the store, and the sale ends today!

180
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,589
Mm... Do I have enough time?

181
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:20,464
If I hurry back now, I think I can make it.

182
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:22,881
Huh?

183
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:25,047
Aww!

184
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:28,297
A little black kitty cat!

185
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,297
Aww! You're just the cutest!

186
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:40,672
Uh! Hold on.

187
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,756
We can't adopt a cat right now.

188
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,881
I already have my hands full with Hakase.

189
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:47,756
Sorry, kitty.

190
00:13:06,214 --> 00:13:07,756
I'm back from the grocery store.

191
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,297
Hiya Nano.

192
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:10,756
Huh?! It's that cat!

193
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,381
I captured the beast!

194
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:14,964
You can't bring in cats that you find on the street.

195
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:18,589
What? But he's so cute.

196
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,964
You do have a point.

197
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:22,964
But he still can't stay here!

198
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:25,172
Come on! Don't you think he's cute?

199
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:30,047
Well, I guess I do. But it's not about his cuteness.

200
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:32,547
It's just that, taking care of an animal can be

201
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:34,797
a big responsibility. So...

202
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,172
Can you handle it, Hakase?

203
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,589
I can!

204
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:39,714
Even though you won't be getting any assistance from me?

205
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:42,464
That means you're the one who has to clean his litter box.

206
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:44,422
You're not gonna help with anything?

207
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:47,297
Fine! Then you're not allowed to pet him ever!

208
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:50,047
That's not fair!

209
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:53,089
All right, maybe I can help... just a little bit.

210
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:58,381
Hakase! He's napping on my lap!

211
00:13:58,464 --> 00:13:59,922
I'm gonna pet him now!

212
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:06,422
He's so fluffy!

213
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,214
Huh? Don't hog him!

214
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:10,881
I want to pet him, too!

215
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:13,047
His belly is so fluffy!

216
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:15,589
And his sides are super fluffy too!

217
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:17,631
His right paw is extra fluffy!

218
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:20,256
And his left paw is super fluffy too!

219
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,839
His little tail is the fluffiest!

220
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:26,964
His tail isn't as fluffy as this spot behind his ears.

221
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:28,672
Huh? But I think it's probably

222
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:30,589
one of the fluffiest features he has.

223
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:32,839
You're wrong! His tail isn't fluffy at all!

224
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,756
What's the matter?

225
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,631
You aren't hurt anywhere, are you?

226
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:46,922
Eureka!

227
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:48,631
Hold on a second!

228
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:49,964
Hakase?

229
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:03,422
Hey, Nano! Check it out!

230
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:05,172
I made a scarf that'll let him talk!

231
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:07,089
What an amazing invention!

232
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,714
Now, let's have Sakamoto try it out.

233
00:15:09,797 --> 00:15:11,006
Sakamoto?

234
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,464
You decided to call the cat Sakamoto?

235
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:16,089
Yup! 'Cause it's the name that's on his box.

236
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:19,006
I guess that's the simplest way to go about it.

237
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,672
Okay! All done!

238
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,797
You think he's really gonna talk?

239
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,589
He'll talk, all right.

240
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:30,172
Here it comes.

241
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:37,339
I don't care who you think you are,

242
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:39,256
that petting was excessive.

243
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,547
Huh?

244
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:42,839
Also, it's common knowledge

245
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,422
that a cat meows when it's hungry.

246
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:47,131
Not that it matters, since I can spell it out for you now.

247
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,089
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:50,047
I wasn't aware of that.

249
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:51,422
And then there's you!

250
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:53,422
Taking the name straight from the side of the box?

251
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:54,589
Have some imagination.

252
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:57,381
I'm so sorry.

253
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,922
I told you the same thing, so I agree with him.

254
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:01,964
Yeah, but!

255
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,839
How old are you two anyway?

256
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:04,964
Eight years old.

257
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,339
I'm one year old.

258
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:10,672
In your human years, I'd be 20 years old.

259
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:14,047
It's Mr. Sakamoto. Capiche?

260
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:15,464
Capiche...?

261
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,714
While I do appreciate the free room and board,

262
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,631
there needs to be some ground rules.

263
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:23,297
And you'll respect those rules
since I'm the oldest one here.

264
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:25,172
Another thing you should know about cats...

265
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:26,422
Just because we're fluffy,

266
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,381
doesn't mean we can be pet indiscriminately.

267
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:29,756
Umm...

268
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,839
To be honest with you, I enjoy being pet.

269
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:33,089
But there's a limit.

270
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:37,131
You understand? Life is all about moderation.

271
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:39,756
I'll go put him back where you found him.

272
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,589
'Kay...

273
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,089
Huh?

274
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,422
My humblest apologies.

275
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:54,547
Hm?

276
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:11,381
Helvetica Standard.

277
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,214
Here you are!

278
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:16,547
Really?

279
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:18,797
But I'm late on my rent payment again this month.

280
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:21,214
And you're still okay with giving me free food?

281
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:23,922
It's fine, I'll always here to help someone in need.

282
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,964
If there's anything else I can
do, feel free to let me know.

283
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:31,006
Do you mean it? Well then, uh...

284
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,756
How about some money?

285
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,089
For the rent.

286
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:35,464
Don't think that I'm going to let a greedy goblin

287
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,714
take advantage of my kindness.

288
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:39,506
Yeah, that makes sense.

289
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:46,464
Now. Vice-Principal.

290
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:47,839
Is this...?

291
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:50,131
What, is something the matter, Principal?

292
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:51,589
You're sweating.

293
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,714
Why don't you go ahead and look inside the doll's body?

294
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,131
If I win this thing, I don't owe you the extra snacks

295
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:13,047
from any of our previous deals.

296
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,631
Got it?

297
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:15,839
Yeah.

298
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:17,381
I'm totally gonna win!

299
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,589
The battle for snacks and juice begins!

300
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,464
Ready... Go!

301
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:25,631
It's okay, Mai!

302
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:28,381
You were a little early on the start.

303
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:30,422
Isn't that right, Mio?

304
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:33,964
I suppose it's possible she jumped the gun. Just a tad.

305
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,339
See? It's fine. We can start over!

306
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,547
Arm wrestlers, take your positions.

307
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:40,714
Ready... Go!

308
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,589
And Mai is the winner!

309
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:47,464
Huh?

310
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:49,297
You caught me off guard!

311
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:52,214
I'll admit, I might have underestimated you.

312
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,339
But now I'm all warmed up and ready to go for real.

313
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:57,339
All right, bring it on!

314
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:04,214
Man, I didn't think my arm would still be this sore!

315
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:05,922
It's from my all-nighter!

316
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:09,006
But I'm just gonna shake it off
and get my head in the game.

317
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:14,089
'Bout time I got serious. Think you can handle me?

318
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:17,547
Ah, dang it! I completely spaced on that one!

319
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,422
I can't believe I threw three rounds in a row!

320
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:21,339
I never woulda seen that coming!

321
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:23,381
That's quite the surprise!

322
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,297
Okay. That's enough.

323
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:28,672
Hold on. Just you wait and see.

324
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:31,797
Mm-hm, I get it. I understand what happened now.

325
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:33,214
Of course! It's simple!

326
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,714
You're all out of beginner's luck,

327
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:37,047
and now it's the end for you! Prepare to meet your doom!

328
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:38,464
Ready!

329
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:48,297
Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events?

330
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,589
What do they call you again?

331
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:52,922
--Hey now. --The immoveable object, right?

332
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:58,464
Mio, hold this for me!

333
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:01,714
'Cause I'm about to unleash the unstoppable force.

334
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:04,672
Prepare for something really special!

335
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,714
Would you please cut that out?!

336
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:09,756
It's because you're not even trying!

337
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,172
I can't fight for real if you don't take this seriously!

338
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:14,172
Come at me with everything you've got this time!

339
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,172
I'll unleash my ultimate moves!

340
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,256
Earth Destroyer!

341
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:18,422
Shooting Star!

342
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,881
Death!

343
00:20:20,964 --> 00:20:21,756
Death!

344
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:46,589
Why? I don't get it.

345
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:49,172
Why does it have to be this way?

346
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:51,464
It's only arm wrestling.

347
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:56,464
How can you be so freakin' good at it?

348
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:00,172
I completely forgot I had to pee this entire time.

349
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:02,214
I'll be right back.

350
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:05,714
I knew something was throwing
me off from the very beginning.

351
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,256
Yuuko?

352
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,131
One extra snack from the station.

353
00:21:10,214 --> 00:21:12,631
And 23 juices.

354
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:48,672
My stupid arm cramp got me caught and yelled at

355
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:52,547
for not doing my homework. Today really is the worst.

356
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:54,422
More importantly, tell me!

357
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,131
I need to know what happens to Masao!

358
00:22:57,214 --> 00:22:58,589
Come on, Mai!

359
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,422
Okay fine, I'll buy you another juice

360
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,506
if you show me what happens next.

361
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:04,714
--Here. --Yoink.

362
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,922
I don't know what I expected.

363
00:23:27,297 --> 00:23:29,881
What was that <i>natto</i> doing inside of me anyway?

364
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:32,172
Was that supposed to be some kind of joke?

365
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:34,589
Well, if it was, it was "natto" very funny!

366
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:36,214
Really, that's the last "straw."

367
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:39,172
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 4.

368
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:40,464
Look forward to it!
