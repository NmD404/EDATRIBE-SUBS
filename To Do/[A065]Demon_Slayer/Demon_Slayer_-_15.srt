you're able to conduct yourself
in a way that's honorable

00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,717
Inosuke: This place
is full of 'em,

184
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,586
as far as the eye can see!

185
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,853
What a pain!

186
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:49,855
Tanjiro: Yeah, you're right.

187
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:52,725
Inosuke?

188
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,593
Inosuke: What do you want?

189
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,929
- Tanjiro: I appreciate this.
- Inosuke: What?

190
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,932
Tanjiro: When you said you'd
go check things out with me,

191
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,735
- I was relieved.
- Inosuke: Huh?

192
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,404
Tanjiro: That ominous scent I
was picking up from the mountain

193
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:09,942
scared me a bit, so having you
here makes me feel better.

194
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,544
So thanks.

195
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,979
( Inosuke sighs )

196
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,882
Woman: I believe
you will find them

197
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,418
comfortable and pleasant
to the touch.

198
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,621
Always live your lives
in a fashion

199
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,424
where you are able
to hold your heads up high.

200
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,892
I wish you luck in battle.

201
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,895
( Inosuke sighs )

202
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,832
- Tanjiro: Inosuke.
- ( Inosuke gasps )

203
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,936
( Tanjiro grunts ) Let's go.

204
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,715
We've come to help out.

205
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,852
I'm Tanjiro Kamado,
rank mizunoto.

206
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:57,856
Demon Slayer 2:
A mizunoto? You serious?

207
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,659
They should have
sent us a hashira.

208
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,663
No matter how many mizunoto they
send in, it won't be enough!

209
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,130
- ( Inosuke growls )
- ( Demon Slayer 2 groans )

210
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,399
Tanjiro: Inosuke!

211
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,933
Inosuke: Ah, shut up!

212
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,536
The only thing I see
around here that's not enough

213
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,938
is this sputtering
pool of sweat in front of me!

214
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,942
Now, how 'bout you tell us
just what is going on here!

215
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,412
Demon Slayer 2: Who do you
think you're talking to?

216
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,946
Did you forget
that I have seniority?

217
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,550
The crow gave us orders
to come to this place,

218
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,054
and ten of us Corps members
gathered here.

219
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,356
¶

220
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,359
not long after
we entered the mountain,

221
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:35,661
that's when it started.

222
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,468
¶

223
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:47,673
( Demon Slayer 3 groans )

224
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,676
( Demon Slayer 2 gasps )

225
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,715
( Narrating ) The slayers
began killing each other.

226
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,318
( Overlapping yells, screams )

227
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:08,761
Demon Slayer 2: I...

228
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,330
( Woman vocalizing )

229
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,832
Demon Slayer 2: I was so...

230
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,672
( Crow gasping )

231
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,940
Demon Slayer 4:
You did well to return.

232
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,809
It would appear that...

233
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,812
Most of my children
have been killed.

234
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:31,684
We may very well find
the twelve kizuki there.

235
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,353
It would seem I'll
have to send in some hashira.

236
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,322
¶

237
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,260
Giyu...

238
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,897
And Shinobu.

239
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,298
( Shinobu chuckles )

240
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,133
Both: Understood.

241
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,302
¶

242
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,836
Shinobu:
If only humans and demons

243
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,638
could get along
with each other.

244
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,908
Wouldn't you agree, tomioka?

245
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,978
Giyu: That's a pipe dream,
as long as demons hunt us.

246
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:07,352
Zenitsu: I wonder
if the others hate me.

247
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:11,757
Would someone normally leave
their friend behind like this?

248
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,960
You'd talk him through it
if you were close, wouldn't you?

249
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:18,230
If they both had tried to
convince me to go, I would have.

250
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,498
- Inosuke: It's all right.
- Zenitsu: I'm sure of it.

251
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,969
But instead, they both
went on their merry way

252
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,504
up that scary mountain,

253
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,108
leaving poor, little me
all alone.

254
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:33,111
( Sparrow chirping )

255
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:33,946
( Zenitsu gasps )

256
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:41,987
( Sighs )

257
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,390
You don't have a care
in the world, do you?

258
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,793
All our human problems,
you have no idea.

259
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,996
- ( Sparrow chirps )
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

260
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,798
You think you're
being cute right now?!

261
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,066
Well, you're really not!

262
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,401
I don't like
this side of you one tiny bit!

263
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,204
Why can't you take some notes
from Nezuko, huh?!

264
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,807
She's adorable,
and she's a Demon!

265
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,809
Huh? ( Screams )

266
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,744
I just realized
he took Nezuko along with him!

267
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,081
Why did he have to go
and take my precious Nezuko

268
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,350
with him like that?!
Damn you, Tanjiro!

269
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,486
Taking a young girl like her
into danger?

270
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:15,954
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

271
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:20,259
I'll save you, Nezuko!

272
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,295
( Wires creaking )

273
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:31,236
Tanjiro: That rattling sound,
what is it?

274
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,371
- Demon Slayer: Not again.
- Tanjiro: Huh?

275
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,040
Demon Slayer:
I've heard this sound before.

276
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,708
It's the sound I heard

277
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:39,345
the moment before everyone
started to kill each other.

278
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,649
Tanjiro: Where's it coming from?

279
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:45,050
( Creaking continues )

280
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,052
( Chorus vocalizing )

281
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,090
- ( Demon Slayer gasps )
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

282
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,068
( All gasp )

283
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,070
¶

284
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,311
( Demon Slayer yelling )

285
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,286
( Wires creaking )

286
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,288
( Tanjiro gasps )

287
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,157
( Inosuke laughs )

288
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,425
These guys morons or somethin'?

289
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,894
They don't know that it's taboo

290
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,962
for us Demon slayers
to fight each other!

291
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,431
Tanjiro: That's not it!
They're acting odd,

292
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,967
like they're being manipulated.

293
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:36,969
Inosuke: Here we go.

294
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,172
I'm gonna cut 'em to pieces!

295
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,373
Tanjiro: You can't do that!

296
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,440
They're alive!

297
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,710
At least, I believe some are.

298
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,912
Besides, the bodies
of the ones who aren't

299
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,681
are still our teammates!

300
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,983
Inosuke: Listen, you.

301
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,852
Stop denying me at every turn!

302
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,921
( Tanjiro groans )

303
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,322
( Demon Slayer gasping )

304
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,291
( Straining )

305
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,000
( Tanjiro gasps )

306
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:12,204
I caught a strange,
sweet scent from his back.

307
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,613
It's threads! They're being
controlled by threads!

308
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:22,748
Cut them off!

309
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:23,749
( Inosuke chuckles )

310
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:24,883
( Yells )

311
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:33,825
I already knew about that
before you caught on.

312
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:38,029
Tanjiro: Where's the location
of the Demon controlling them?

313
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,697
( Breeze blows )

314
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,034
( Gasps )
What's that revolting odor?

315
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,102
Was just for a second, though.

316
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,038
( Spiders skittering )

317
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,707
Spiders?

318
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,212
( Demon laughs )

319
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:55,814
( Tanjiro gasps )

320
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,717
I get it!

321
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,920
The spiders
are just attaching people

322
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:04,122
to the puppet strings.
That means...

323
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:06,959
( Webs creaking )

324
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,931
( Demon laughs )

325
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:15,934
Now listen closely,
my precious little dolls.

326
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,605
Dance until
your arms and legs fall off.

327
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,273
Tanjiro: Cutting the threads
isn't enough.

328
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,076
The spiders
will just replace them.

329
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,144
So we--( Gags )

330
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,080
That horrible smell again.

331
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,250
What is it?
It's coming from far away.

332
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:36,221
Inosuke: So all we gotta do

333
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,757
is annihilate
those damn insects, huh?

334
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,626
Tanjiro: No way!
They're too small,

335
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,761
and there's gotta be
at least a million of them.

336
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,096
We gotta find the Demon
who's controlling them instead!

337
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:45,964
Inosuke: Gotcha!

338
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:50,302
( Grunting )

339
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:51,970
Tanjiro: It's no good, Inosuke.

340
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:55,106
Listen, if you have
some kind of power

341
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,375
that can pinpoint
the Demon's location,

342
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,844
that would really help!

343
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,113
This disgusting smell
has been blowing in,

344
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,982
but I just can't tell
where it's from!

345
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,318
You there, your name?!

346
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,385
Demon Slayer: Murata!

347
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,255
Tanjiro: Murata, the two of us

348
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,724
will take care of
the people being controlled.

349
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,692
In the meantime...

my family's peaceful life.

Tanjiro: He's floating?

356
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:39,951
No. He's standing
on the threads.

357
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,219
His family?

358
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:43,021

00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,324
to make quick work
of all of you.

360
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,026
Tanjiro: Who's mother?

361
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:50,763
( Inosuke growling )

362
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,172
Damn you!

363
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,908
Where the hell do you think
you're going? Fight me!

364
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:03,909
Fight--( Gags )

365
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:05,177
Tanjiro: You all right, Inosuke?

366
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,846
Inosuke: Why did he
even show up, anyway?

367
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:09,247
Tanjiro: I don't think
he's the Demon

368
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,249
who's controlling our people
with those threads.

369
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,118
We can't focus on him now.

370
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,920
Zenitsu: Okay, okay, okay!

371
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:16,221
I get it, all right?

372
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,125
You want me
to go find the one who is!

373
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,927
Shut up about it already!

374
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:25,397
( Growls )

375
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,332
Beast breathing.

376
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:31,136
Seventh form,
spatial awareness!

377
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,038
¶

378
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,279
( Breathing deeply )

379
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:01,900
I've found you, you Demon!

380
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,836
¶

381
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,309
Demon 2: I won't let
anyone get in our way.

382
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:16,915
The five of us are going to live
in happiness as a family.

383
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,220
No one on this mortal plane
will tear us apart.

384
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:23,521
