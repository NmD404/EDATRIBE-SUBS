to survive this long.

I know I have what it takes!

Whether it's today or tomorrow,

Zenitsu: Tanjiro,
where are you right now?

15
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:18,343
I can still hear
that creepy sound.

16
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,545
I just hope he's safe.

17
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,415
Shoichi: Um, zenitsu, is it me,

18
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,418
or are we just going
around and around in circles?

19
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,754
Zenitsu: I knew it! I was
getting the exact same feeling!

20
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,157
I knew I could rely on you
to help me out, shoichi!

21
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,626
All right.

22
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,496
Can you check to see
if this room is clear?

23
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,364
Hey, what's with that look?!

24
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,701
All right, all right, fine!
You win! I'll do it myself!

Tanjiro: I can do it.
I know I can.

42
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,015
I always finish what I start.

No matter what, even with
my body in this condition,

45

00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:04,917
Damn it! I can't win like this.

50
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,586
I need more
than just determination.

51
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,055
Calm down. Use your head
to think things through.

( Drum beats )

53
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:15,694
Think, tanjiro! Think!

54
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,603
That was close.
I barely scraped by there.

55
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,406
Kyogai: Curses!
This is irritating.

56
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:30,675
I need to consume some marechi

Kyogai: Eh?

64
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,558
It's kyogai.

Tanjiro: Kyogai!

66

Listen, I'm not
giving you that child!

I won't bend to you!

get my hands on that boy

72

among the twelve kizuki!

Disappointing. Your writing
is absolutely insipid.

80

Every last word on these pages
is utterly trite!

81

There's no beauty,
vulnerability, or impact.

82
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,625
Why don't you forget
this fantasy of being a writer?

83
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,162
It would simply be
a waste of ink and paper.

84
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:01,966
It doesn't help that you
never even step outside anymore.

85
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,637
It's no wonder
you're such a dull individual.

86
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,907
And, if that's the case,
you might as well stick

87
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,444
with your original hobby
of playing the drum.

88
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,579
Not that you're good enough

89
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,383
to be more than an amateur
with that, either.

The speed of these rotations

00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,915
What a terrifying skill.

104
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,917
Not only that,

105
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,720

five claws instead of three!

Now that I've dodged his strikes

without stepping
on those papers,

110
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,542
I can protect my wounds,

111
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,644
because I know
how to move around and breathe.

112
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:56,515
Take quick, shallow breaths.

113
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,618
Use that breathing technique

114
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,755
to reinforce the muscles
around your broken leg!

115
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,890
Also, right before
the claw attack,

116
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,493
there's a strong scent of mold.

My blood demon art...

154
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,231

Wow, it worked.

162
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,102
He said it would
automatically extract blood

163
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,971
when applied like this,
but seeing it in action

164
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,274

00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,335
I was told that,
under yushiro's spell,

175
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:05,738
it would be invisible
until it meowed,

176
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,007
and then vanish again
when it meowed a second time.

177
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,676
So it's true, then.

178

00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:42,374
There's no beauty,
vulnerability, or impact.

185
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,844
¶

186
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,312
kyogai: It wasn't worthless.

187
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,515
At the very least,

188
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,051
that child didn't believe so.

189
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,155
He respectfully avoided
trampling upon my work.

190
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,825
Tanjiro: May your soul
rest in peace.

191
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,262
( Kyogai crying )

192
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:13,872
Both my blood demon art
and my drum playing...

193
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,711
Have been recognized.

194
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,251
Tanjiro: Kiyoshi! Teruko!

195
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,321
Are you here? Answer me!

196
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,391
Teruko! Kiyoshi!

197
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,525
( Teruko screams )

198
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,194
( Kiyoshi yells )

199
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,395
( Tanjiro groans )

200
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,130
Teruko: Uh...

201
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,266
Kiyoshi: Sorry, tanjiro.

202
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,135
Tanjiro: Why are the two of you
throwing stuff at me?

203
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,470
Kiyoshi: We're sorry

204
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,173
the drum we were using
disappeared, so we panicked.

205
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,809
Tanjiro: I see.

206
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,278
Well, you're safe. I'm glad.

207
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,047
( Teruko crying )

208
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,086
Tanjiro: You did a great job
hanging in there.

209
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,221
You, too, Kiyoshi.

210
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,424
Come on. Let's head outside.

211
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,093
Kiyoshi, hop on.

212
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,295
( Footsteps shuffling )

213
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,830
How's your leg feeling?

214
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,232
Kiyoshi: Not too bad.

215
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,967
Tanjiro: Just hang on
a little longer.

216
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,904
I'm picking up
zenitsu and shoichi's scent.

217
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,973
They're probably outside.

218
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:22,974
Seems they're both sa--

219
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,175
( gasps )

220
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,444
I smell blood.

221
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,979
Kiyoshi: What's the matter?

222
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,049
Nothing. Let's hurry along.

223
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,017
¶

224
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,125
- ( Thump )
- Swordsman: Take this!

225
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,994
Come on! Move it!

226
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,064
Now, you spineless coward!

227
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,332
Draw your sword, and face me!

228
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,300
( Tanjiro gasps )

229
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,138
( Shoichi sobbing )

230
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,873
Zenitsu: Tanjiro...

231
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:00,479
The box, I protected it.

232
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,414
You told me...

233
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,550
This was
more important to you...

234
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,319
Than your own life.

235
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,456
That's why I did it.

236
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:21,200
The fact is, I've always
had really good hearing.

237
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,173
There have been times
when I knew what people said,

238
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,375
even though
I had been fast asleep.

239
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,311
That really
creeped everyone out.

240
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,383
I don't hear any more demons.

241
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:41,086
You must have
finished the job, tanjiro.

242
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,189
I can hear you all

243
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:48,394
and also these
odd-sounding, loud footsteps.

244
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,331
Shoichi: Zenitsu! Zenitsu!

245
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,867
Please, wake up!

246
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,205
Oh. Thank goodness!

247
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,007
Are you all right?

248
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,274
( Zenitsu groans )

249
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,210
Shoichi: When the room
spun around earlier,

250
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,612
we ended up
getting thrown outside.

251
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,614
We fell
from the second-story window.

252
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,151
( Zenitsu gasps )

253
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,619
- Did we, really?
- Shoichi: Yeah

254
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,222
you made sure that I was
protected at the time, though,

255
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,558
so I didn't end up
getting hurt at all.

256
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,227
Zenitsu: I'm glad to hear that.

257
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,164
So what's
with all the tears, then?

258
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,399
Huh?

259
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,504
Now I understand!

260
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:34,639
I fell right onto my head,
didn't I?!

261
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,707
Shoichi: Yes.

262
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,176
Zenitsu: Am I gonna--

263
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,643
am I gonna die?!

264
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,312
Oh, no. The world
is starting to spin.

265
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,715
- Is this the end for me?!
- ( Swordsman laughing )

266
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:45,650
Zenitsu: What's going on?
I don't like that sound!

267
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,587
Kiyoshi: Watch out,
'cause, ready or not,

268
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,455
I'm comin' through!

269
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,323
( Zenitsu shrieks )

270
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,725
There it is again,

271
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,460
that terrifying boar monster!

272
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,197
( Swordsman laughs )

273
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,265
Picking up
a demonic presence here.

274
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,333
( Zenitsu gasps ) Hey, wait.

275
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,536
I know where I've heard
that voice before.

276
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,538
He's the fifth survivor.

277
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,339
During final selection,

278
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,275
he was the first
to rush up the mountain

279
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,411
and the first to come back down.

280
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,546
- What a force of nature!
- Swordsman: Hmm?

281
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,218
( Laughs )

282
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,287
I've found you, demon!

283
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,622
( Roars )

284
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,623
Zenitsu: Stop it!

285
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,226
¶

286
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,094
swordsman: What the hell?

287
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,495
Who are you?

288
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:32,297
Get outta my way!

289
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,633
Zenitsu: My name
is zenitsu agatsuma!

290
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,436
I'm a demon slayer,
the same as you!

291
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,439
Swordsman: Oh? Are you, now?

292
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,307
Then, you should already know!

293
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,110
We gotta get rid
of that thing at all costs!

294
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,312
Now get the hell out of my way!

295
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,447
Zenitsu: I refuse!

296
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,781
This belongs to tanjiro--

297
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,583
swordsman:
Don't you argue with me!

298
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:55,654
I'll deal with him and his box
if that's the case.

299
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,257
I won't say it again. Move!

300
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,659
( Zenitsu whimpering )

301
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:03,595
Swordsman: Do you wanna die?

302
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,597
Zenitsu: This box,

303
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,266
I won't let you touch it!

304
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,667
I don't know what's inside,

305
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,802
but I know that it's
precious to tanjiro!

306
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:13,404
Swordsman: Are you serious?

307
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,740
Use your damn head!

308
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,276
There's a demon in that box!

309
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,078
Don't you get that?

310
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,279
Zenitsu: Of course I do!

311
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,147
I've known that
from the very start!

312
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:27,486
I knew he was
traveling with a demon,

313
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:32,291
because the sounds demons make
aren't anything like a human.

314
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,759
That said,

315
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:37,829
the sounds I hear from tanjiro
are so kind and gentle,

316
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,765
it makes me want to cry.

317
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:45,771
I don't think I've ever heard
anything like it before.

318
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,642
All living creatures
constantly give off vibrations.

319
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,711
The world is full
of sounds ringing out...

320
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,315
Breathing, heartbeats,

321
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,083
the rhythm
of blood circulating.

322
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,586
By listening closely,
I'm able to tell

323
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,523
what kind of thoughts are
going through someone's head.

324
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:09,328
Even so, I've been deceived
by others many times.

325
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,664
That's because
I've always stubbornly believed

326
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,733
in whomever I wanted.

327
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:18,537
Tanjiro, despite being
a demon slayer,

328
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,739
is traveling with a demon,

329
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:25,344
but I'm sure he has
a good reason for doing so.

330
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,278
Whatever that reason may be,

331
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:30,549
I'm sure I can
put my faith behind it.

332
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,551
I'll do it.

333
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,952
Swordsman: Huh?

334
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,487
Zenitsu: I'll ask him.

335
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,690
I'll ask tanjiro
about the demon myself.

336
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,625
Until that happens,

337
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,961
just leave it alone!

338
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,663
( Both grunting )

339
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,839
Swordsman:
Let go of me, damn it!

340
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,041
- ( Zenitsu yelps )
- Swordsman: You're a pest!

341
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,911
( Grunts )

342
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,446
( Growls )

343
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,415
Zenitsu: I won't
let you touch that!

344
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,387
It's important to tanjiro.

345
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,255
Stay away from it!

346
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:16,461
You're not laying a finger on it
until he gets back!

347
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,796
Swordsman: Damn you!

348
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:18,664
( Sputters )

349
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,332
Take this!

350
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,402
- ( Blows landing )
- ( Both grunting )

351
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,671
Swordsman: Move it!

352
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,473
Zenitsu: No! I refuse!

353
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,409
¶

354
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:34,946
swordsman: Take this!

355
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,616
Come on! Move it!

356
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,219
Now, you spineless coward!

357
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,353
Draw your sword, and face me!

358
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,689
( Tanjiro gasps )

359
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:47,959
( Shoichi sobbing )

360
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,229
Zenitsu: Tanjiro...

361
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:55,434
The box, I protected it.

362
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,769
You told me...

363
00:18:57,838 --> 00:19:00,639
This was
more important to you...

364
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,274
Than your own life.

365
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,511
That's why I did it.

366
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:10,381
Swordsman: You idiot!
After all that bluster,

367
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,584
you don't even bother
to draw your sword!

368
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:16,588
If you're a fellow demon slayer,
then let's see you fight!

369
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,457
( Zenitsu groaning )

370
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,861
( Tanjiro growls )

371
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,329
Swordsman: If you're
not gonna fight,

372
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,265
then get the hell out of my way!

373
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,233
¶

374
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,503
- ( blows landing )
- ( Both grunting )

375
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,273
Swordsman: Move aside!

376
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,777
- ( Blows landing )
- ( Both grunting )

377
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:43,615
( Tanjiro growls )

378
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,417
Swordsman: Fine, then.

379
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:48,954
If all you're gonna do
is keep me from doing my job,

380
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,689
then you leave no choice,

381
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:53,558
but to take you out
along with that box!

382
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:55,894
( Zenitsu groaning )

383
00:19:58,499 --> 00:19:59,764
Tanjiro: Stop it!

384
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,233
Swordsman: Huh?

385
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,770
( Zenitsu groaning )

386
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:11,710
Tanjiro: I said stop!

387
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,713
( Yelling )

388
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,949
( Chorus vocalizing )

389
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,123

390
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,991
( singing in Japanese )
