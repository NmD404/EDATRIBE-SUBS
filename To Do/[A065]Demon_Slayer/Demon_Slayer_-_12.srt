Swordsman:
Hope you're ready for me,

00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,205
'cause I'm comin' through!

3
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:10,075
Demon: It's all so infuriating!

Tanjiro: Teruko!

8
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,483
Hold on to the furniture!

( Grunts )

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,220
That demon has special powers!

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,356
You shouldn't be attacking
so recklessly!

12
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,025

Demon: How maddening,

19
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,004
all these cursed insects
running amok in my house.

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,205

25
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,421
I can't believe
the room spun around!

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,357
Now, this is
what I call a fun time!

27
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,225
( Laughs )

28
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,563
Tanjiro: Get your dirty feet
off of her!

29
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,901
Swordsman:
Who the hell are you, kid?

30
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,704
Tanjiro: Stepping
on a little kid like that!

31
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,905
What are you thinking?!

32
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,107
( Swordsman laughs )

33
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,576
You got spunk. I like that.

34
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,380
Having a human send me flying,
that's a first for me!

( Yells )

36
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,917
Tanjiro: Why is he
coming after me?

37
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,785
Isn't he a demon slayer?

38
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,856
Swordsman: These swords
do a lot of damage.

39
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,190
They're not the kind

40
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,526
you delicate little flowers
would use.

41
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,728
The way they shred through flesh

42
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,197
is what I pride myself on
the most.

43
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,799
Tanjiro: This is foolish!
There's a demon right there!

44
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:17,202
Swordsman:
You think I care?! Hah!

45
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,204
Demon: Measly insects.

46
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,605
You're irksome.

47
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,074
Now die!

00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,810
( Tanjiro gasps )

49
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,346
The floor just ripped apart.

50
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,283
It happened at the speed
of the beat of the drum

51
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,652
and in the shape
of a beast's claws!

52
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,158
Rotating right.

53
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,427
Back left.

54
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,829
Demon: Insects.

55
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,699
Miserable vermin!

56
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,035
( Swordsman groans )

57
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:54,038

to understand.

( Drum beating )

60
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,247
Tanjiro:
We're in another room now?

61
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,317
But that demon
didn't strike his drum,

62
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,252
so what does this mean?

63
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:11,723
I'm picking up the scent of
multiple demons in this house.

64
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,993
Is there another demon
with a drum, then?

65
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,328
Is that why...

66
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,863
( Sniffs )

67
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:19,864
( Teruko whimpering )

68
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,334
Tanjiro: I can smell blood.

69
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,536
It's gonna be fine.

70
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,471
You just stay behind me.

71
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,140

¶

74
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,350
another human mauled and eaten.

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,020
Teruko: Is something wrong?

76
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,357
Tanjiro: No, we're fine.
There's no demons.

77
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,259
Come on. Let's head out.

78
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,829
Keep your eyes forward,
all right?

79
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,297
Don't look behind you.

80
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,567
( Sniffs )

81
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,837
I smell something else,

82
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,640
a unique scent of blood
that I've never smelled before.

83
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:06,044
Seems like
there wasn't much bleeding.

90
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,542
Excuse me.
Can we stop, zenitsu?

( Wailing )

93
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:49,554
You gotta warn me first
before you speak up!

94
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,557
You can't go surprising me
like that here!

95
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:57,362
My heart nearly jumped
out of my mouth just now!

96
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,630
Shoichi: Sorry about that.

97
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,365
Zenitsu: If I had
a heart attack,

98
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:01,900
you would have been
directly responsible!

99
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,503
You'd be a murderer!
Do you understand?!

100
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,971
Shoichi: Well, it's just that...

101
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,108
You've been sweating, gasping,
and shivering really badly.

102
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,510
Zenitsu: What about it?!

103
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,312
I'm doing the best
I can here, all right?!

104
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,449
Shoichi: Um,
forgive me for saying so,

105
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,784
but you're making me
really nervous, too.

106
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,586
Zenitsu: Oh, no! I'm sorry!

107
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:26,191
It's just I feel if we
make too much noise here,

108
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,594
that demon you saw,
it might find us, right?

109
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,664
That's why
I think it would be best

110
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,599
to be as quiet as possible!
Don't you think?!

118
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,818
It's just my luck
we'd run into a demon!

120
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,790
Stay away! Stay away from us!

121
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,260

Zenitsu: W-we don't taste good!

125
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sure I taste awful!
I'm serious!

126
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,535
This kid's all skin and bones,

127
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:13,338
so he'd be dry
and taste terrible!

128
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,873
( Demon laughs )

129
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,943
How will I know for sure
until I have a lick?

131
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,347
Are you kidding me?!

132
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,816
His tongue is like
a bolt of lighting!

134
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,820

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Zenitsu, you've gotta get up!

138
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,962
( Zenitsu wails ) My knees!

139
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,498
My fear is in my knees!

140
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,101
Shoichi: This isn't the time
to complain about that stuff!

141
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,835
( Zenitsu groans )

142
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,504
Just leave me behind, okay?

143
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,106
Make a run for it!

144
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,840

do something like that.

146
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,444
What a sweet kid.

147
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,747
As useless as I am,
he's sticking by me.

148
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,049
I gotta find
a solution to this.

149
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:01,853
If I don't protect him, I don't
wanna think of what'll happen.

150
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,656
Dying before he reaches
adulthood would be tragic.

151
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,792
But I'm so horribly weak.

152
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,459
Shoichi: Get up!

153
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,796
Zenitsu: I don't have
the strength to protect him.

154
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,465
But, if I don't,
then that would mean...

( Demon laughs )

156
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:18,337
I'm going to relish
using my tongue

157

out through your ears.

185
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,618
Shoichi: Zenitsu?

186
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,890
Zenitsu: Thunder breathing...

187
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,491
First form.

188
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,960
Thunderclap and flash.

189
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,963
( Demon gasps )

190
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,500
( Shoichi gasps )

191
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,507
( Zenitsu snorts )

192
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,942
( Gasps )

193
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,580
( Shrieks )

194
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,181
It's dead?!

195
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,117
When did that happen?!

196
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,853
What the hell?! This is weird!

197
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,889
What is this? Yuck!

198
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,491
( Gasps )

199
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:24,663
Shoichi, did--did you just...

200
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,067
( Gasps ) You saved me!
Thank you so much!

201
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,736
I'll never forget
that you did this!

202
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,871
Why didn't you
just tell me from the start

203
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,074
that you were so powerful?!

204
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,276
- ( Sobbing )
- Shoichi: Huh?

205
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,678
What are you talking about?

206
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,880
Zenitsu: You say something?

207
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,083
Shoichi: Huh? No.

208
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,952
Uh, mm-mmm.

209
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,620
It's nothing.

210
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,756
We should go now.

211
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,223
Zenitsu: Yeah.

212
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:54,025
( Swordsman panting )

213
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,761
Damn it!
He sent me flying again!

214
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,831
These last three days,
it's been the same old crap.

215
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,100
I don't like making my way

216
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,901
through a cramped building
like this!

217
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,770
It's just not my thing

218
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,171
( growling )

219
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,109
( Demon growls )

220
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:13,979
Swordsman: Huh?

221
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,047
Demon: You dodged that.

222
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:19,250
You seem quite spry, human.

223
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,189
Your healthy flesh will be
well worth gouging out to eat!

224
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,790
( Swordsman growls )

225
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,994
( Exhales )

226
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,063
Self-taught style,
beast breathing!

227
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:36,135
It's gonna feel so good to rip
such a huge target to shreds!

228
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,003
( Demon laughs )

229
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,539
You've got a lot of guts
to charge me head-on like that!

230
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,007
( Groans )

231
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,943
( Wailing )

232
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,745
( Swordsman laughs )

233
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,747
Revel in your own death,

234
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,749
and serve as my catalyst!

235
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:51,750
( Demon gags )

236
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,653
Swordsman: Fang three, devour!

237
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,555
¶

238
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,360
( swordsman laughs )

239
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:05,164
Coming through! Coming through!

240
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:08,600
( Footsteps rumbling )

241
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,971
Demon: Marechi, I need it.

242
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,240
To devour even one,

243
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,576
I would have as many as 50--

244
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,045
nay, 100 bodies worth.

245
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:24,916
I must search for more humans
with marechi and devour them.

246
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,786
In doing so, I will be able

247
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,857
to reclaim my place
among the twelve kizuki.

248
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,692
( Demon gobbling )

249
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,134
Kibutsuji: Kyogai.

250
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,335
( Kyogai grunts )

251
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,338
Kibutsuji:
Why have you stopped eating?

252
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,607
( Kyogai gasps )

253
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,209
Kibutsuji: Have you
reached your limit?

254
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,878
Kyogai: No, sir. I can go on!

255
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,748
( Groans )

256
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,753
P-Please! Give me
just a little more time.

257
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,821
Kibutsuji: I think not.

258
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,091
I am stripping you
of your number,

259
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,228
because you have
nothing more to offer me.

260
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,963
Kyogai:
The more humans you devour,

261
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,365
the stronger you become.

262
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:16,235
Once he saw my potential,

263
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:20,239
master kibutsuji was willing
to share his blood with me.

264
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:25,310
The power of that man's blood
was simply astonishing.

265
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,845
I was sure that I'd grow

266
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,248
infinitely stronger
than ever before

267
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:34,119
and recognized into the ranks
of the twelve kizuki.

268
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:37,056
I would continue
to gorge myself on humans

269
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,792
and steadily become
even more powerful!

270
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,862
Or so I believed.

271
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,997
( Teruko gasps )
Kiyoshi, we found you!

272
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,333
( Kiyoshi gasps )

273
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,869
Teruko: Brother! Brother!

274
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,272
Kiyoshi: Teruko!

275
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:56,942
Who is he?

276
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,011
Tanjiro: Tanjiro kamado,

277
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,147
and I'm a demon slayer.

278
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,682
( Kiyoshi gasps )

279
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:05,751
Tanjiro: You two have
hung in there really well.

280
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,887
Can you show me your wounds?

281
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,822
( Kiyoshi sobs )

282
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,658
Teruko: Why, Kiyoshi?

283
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,163
¶

284
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,766
tanjiro: This ointment here
is really amazing!

285
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,202
My master gave it to me
for a time like this!

286
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,171
Wanna know something funny?

287
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,039
He always wears a tengu mask.

288
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,241
Kiyoshi: A tengu? Really?

289
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,043
Tanjiro: It's the truth.

290
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,445
Anyway, this ointment
is fantastic.

291
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,115
You'll feel better right away.

292
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,718
That'll do it!

293
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:42,988
Well? You feel better?

294
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,056
Kiyoshi: Yes.

295
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,327
Tanjiro: Tell me exactly
what happened if you can.

296
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,663
( Kiyoshi gasping )

297
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:55,801
A monster dragged me away,
and...

298
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,337
It nearly ate me.

299
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,872
Mm, but then...

300
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,274
Another one showed up
out of nowhere.

301
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:07,278
They started
fighting to the death over...

302
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:11,316
Who was gonna get to e-eat me.

303
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:15,420
Then...

304
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:19,158
The demon with the drums
growing out of him...

305
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,160
Left one of the drums behind

306
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,829
after he was defeated
by the others.

307
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:28,433
When I picked it up and hit it,
the room changed.

308
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:31,102
That's how I held out.

309
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:33,172
( Sobbing )

310
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,377
Tanjiro: A demon with drums
growing from him? That guy?

311
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:42,647
He said, I think,
something about "marechi."

312
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,250
( Kiyoshi gasps )
Yes, that's right!

313
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,853
I don't know what it means,
but he called me that!

314
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,921
( Crow caws )

315
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,590
The term "marechi"

316
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,393
refers to the owner
of a rare type of blood!

317
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,995
( Both gasp )

318
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,929
( Crow laughs )

319
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,330
What's that look?

320
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,132
I'll teach you respect!

321
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:02,801
Tanjiro: Cut it out!

322
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,271
When you say, "rare blood,"
wh-what do you mean?

323
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,207
Crow: The blood
of all living species

324
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,475
can be broken into types,
you see?

325
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:12,211
The more scarce the blood--

326
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,479
or the more uncommon it is,
I should say--

327
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:17,216
the more desirable
it is to demons,

328
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:21,286
for, you see, in terms of
nutritional value for a demon,

329
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,154
a human marechi is akin

330
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,157
to eating as many
as a hundred normal humans.

331
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:29,895
A marechi is like
a bountiful feast for them,

332
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,963
a delicacy for the ages.

333
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,365
( Both shuddering )

334
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:35,567
( Tanjiro sniffs )

335
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:36,568
( Gasps )

336
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,470
¶

337
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:45,043
marechi. Marechi.

338
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,112
( Tanjiro groans )

339
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,247
I'm gonna head out there.

340
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,448
( Kiyoshi gasps )

341
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,517
Tanjiro: Keep calm.
It's all right.

342
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,386
I'm going
to take down that demon.

343
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,257
- Teruko, listen to me.
- Teruko: Huh?

344
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,392
Your brother is really worn out
at the moment,

345
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,061
so watch after him, all right?

346
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,263
( Teruko grunts )

347
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,265
Tanjiro: Soon as
I leave this room,

348
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,000
use the drum to change areas,

349
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,270
just like Kiyoshi's been doing.

350
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,339
If someone tries to open
the door or you hear something,

351
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,342
strike that drum
to remove yourself from danger.

352
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:20,545
I promise
that I'll come for you.

353
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:23,081
I'll follow your scent back.

354
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,951
Then I'll call your names
so you know it's me.

355
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,287
( Both whimper )

356
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,556
Tanjiro: Just hold out
a little longer.

357
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,092
Can you do it?

358
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,494
( Both grunt )

359
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,330
Great! So brave!

360
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:42,301
I'm off.

361
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,269
( Footsteps pounding )

362
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:47,372
¶

363
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,208
( chorus vocalizing )

364
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:51,977
Strike it!

365
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:52,911
( Beats drum )

366
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:58,083
Kyogai: Damn insects.
So infuriating!

367
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,528
¶

368
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,265
( tanjiro gasps )

369
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,369
The right drum
flips the room right.

370
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,540
The left one flips it left.

371
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,476
Right leg, forward spin!

372
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,478
Left leg, backward spin!

373
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,616
The drum on his belly
launches that claw attack!

374
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,086
( Pounding drums )

375
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,989
¶

376
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,232
( Gasps )

377
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,567
So fast.

378
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:51,370
The speed of the rotations
and attacks are brutal!

379
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,239
Miss tamayo did treat my wounds,

380
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,709
but these injuries
aren't fully healed yet.

381
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:01,312
Can i--can I beat him?

382
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,182
I'm in so much pain.

383
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,085
I don't know how much longer
I can hold on!

384
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,720
This whole time,

385
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:11,256
I've just been grinning
and bearing it.

386
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:14,193
When I pulled zenitsu
off that girl he was chasing,

387
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,528
when I shouted at him
out of anger,

388
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,398
I was enduring
the most terrible pain.

389
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,000
I had to withstand it.

390
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:25,104
It was my duty
as the eldest son of my family.

391
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:29,340
Whenever I tense up,
my broken bones ache,

392
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:32,077
stopping me
from mustering any strength.

393
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,415
That demon's attack
is leaving tears

394
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,950
that look like claw marks.

395
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:42,221
I'm too scared
to move in closer.

396
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:46,291
If I charge forward
to get within striking distance,

397
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,494
I'm afraid that a flash of pain
will make me falter.

398
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,363
If that happens...

399
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,900
I'll be torn to shreds.

400
00:18:57,705 --> 00:19:01,172
I can't help but imagine
the most awful things.

401
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:02,641
Help me!

402
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:08,179
Urokodaki: Consider
the characteristics of water.

403
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:11,450
Pour it into a container,
and it's square.

404
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,652
Pour it into a bottle,
and it's round.

405
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:18,189
It can smash boulders or
flow as far as the eye can see.

406
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,059
Tanjiro: Of course.
That's right!

407
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,396
I remember. There are
ten water breathing forms,

408
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:27,599
so I can adapt to any opponent.

409
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,334
If you're wounded,

410
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,203
then you have to make a move
that will compensate for it.

411
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:36,508
I can take on any form, and
this flow will never be stopped!

412
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,881
More important than my bones,
my spirit was broken.

413
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,683
( Zenitsu weeps )

414
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,686
That's not gonna
do anyone any good!

415
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:50,421
Tanjiro: Would you stay
out of my head, please?!

416
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,492
Look straight ahead.

417
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,094
Steel yourself.

418
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:58,764
Give it everything you've got.

419
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,565
You can do it!

420
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,468
¶

421
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,905
I've been able
to survive this long.

422
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:09,441
I know I have what it takes!

423
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,378
Whether it's today or tomorrow,

424
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,713
I can assure you this!

425
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,848
( Kyogai growls )

426
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,651
Tanjiro: Without a shadow
of doubt in my mind,

427
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:22,854
I will not yield!

428
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:23,855
¶

429
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,758
( singing in Japanese )
