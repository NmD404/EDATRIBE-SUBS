( Singing in japanese )

7
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,466
Urokodaki:
The demon slayer corps.

8
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,535
We number in the hundreds.

9
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,939
An organization completely
unrecognized by the government.

10
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:20,679
Since ancient times, we have
existed to hunt down demons.

11
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,749
However, the identity of
the demon slayer corps's leader

12
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,752
has always remained a mystery.

13
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,754
Demons...

14
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,891
Their staple food, humans.

15
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,227
They hunt and kill them.

16
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,831
It is unclear when or where
they first appeared.

17
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,899
Incredible physical prowess.

18
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,902
Their wounds heal
almost instantly.

19
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,705
Flesh completely
restores itself.

20
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,641
Severed limbs regenerated.

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,643
Some can shape-shift.

22
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,312
Some have other powers.

23
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,781
They can only be killed
by sunlight

24
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,519
or decapitation
with a special sword.

25
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,921
The demon slayers
fight these demons

26
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,790
with mere mortal bodies.

27
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,660
As humans,
wounds are slow to heal,

28
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,864
and their lost limbs
are unable to grow back.

29
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:17,569
Nevertheless, they fight
to protect and defend humanity.

( Tanjiro panting )

32
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,285
Urokodaki: I am a trainer.

33
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,021
My job is
to teach new swordsmen.

34
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,357
There are many other trainers.

35
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,959
Each one is different.

36
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,296
They all educate their students
using their own methods.

37
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,700
To complete your training
and join the demon slayer corps,

38
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,367
you will have to survive

39
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,905
the final selection process
on mount fujikasane,

40
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,573
and I decide whether

41
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,242
you'll undertake
that challenge or not.

42
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,912
Tanjiro: As of today,

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,981
I'm going to start
keeping a journal for nezuko.

44
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,318
I'm descending the mountain
again today.

45
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,488
I'll train so that I can survive
through the final selection.

46
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,062
Day after day, I've made my way
down the mountain,

47
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:20,332
and I'm starting to learn
how to avoid most of the traps,

48
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,068
because I'm much stronger now,

49
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,537
and somehow
I've gotten even better

50
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,407
at picking up subtle scents
than I was before.

51
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:30,876
However...

52
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,748
The traps
are getting more difficult.

53
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,852
I'm starting to think
he wants me dead.

54
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,833
Today I carried my sword with me
down the mountain,

55
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,935
but it made moving
a lot harder.

56
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,372
( Yells )

57
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,707
The weight's throwing me off.

58
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,843
I get caught in every trap.

60
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,582
- 992...
- Today I swung the sword.

61
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,718
Actually, not just today.
That's been every day.

62
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,520
As soon as i'm
down the mountain,

63
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,122
I swing it 'til I feel
like my arms'll fall off.

64
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,792
1,000!

65
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
Urokodaki: Now do 500 more.

Urokodaki:
Swords are fragile weapons.

70
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,481
Tanjiro: That's how
my sword training started.

71
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,150
Though strong
along the blade's edge,

72
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,852
it's very weak on the sides.

73
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,591
So obviously you have to apply
the force where it's strongest.

74
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,760
The direction
the blade is facing

75
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,897
and the direction you swing
have to be exactly the same.

76
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,899
Otherwise, it'll break.

77
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,836
Urokodaki told me,
"if you ever break your sword,

78
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,904
I'll break
every bone in your body."

79
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,875
He sounded just like that, too,
very ominous.

80
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:14,980
Nezuko.

81
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,982

Today, I fell down.

87

I'm training to do it
as softly as possible

88
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,740
so I can get up quickly
from any position.

charge mr. Urokodaki,
and try to kill him.

was about breathing techniques

102

and fighting forms.

103
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,517
Total concentration breathing?

Urokodaki: That's right.

105
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,254
Also I'm going to teach you

106
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,924
how to use
all ten water-breathing forms.

107
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:35,794
Start by taking
a long, deep breath

108
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,131
so the oxygen flows
into every cell of your body.

109
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,800
This will enhance
your healing ability

110
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,537
and stabilize, as well
as energize, your spirit.

111
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,941
Now relax
your arms and shoulders,

112
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,010
but keep your lower body braced.

113
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,545

to come look at her,
but he couldn't find anything.

practicing what I'd learned
from urokodaki.

All the basics like holding
my breath and staying flexible.

190
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,893

all down in this journal.

even after six more months,

I can't cut through the boulder.

194
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,410
It's frustrating.

I'm sorry. Who are you?

286
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,970
The girl told me
her name was makomo.

287
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,475
And the name of the guy
who beat me up was sabito.

288
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:18,944
Makomo helped guide me

289
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,180
by pointing out
everything I was doing wrong.

290
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,217
She corrected
my unnecessary movements

291
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,685
and all my bad habits,

292
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,355
but, when I asked her
why she was helping me

293
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:33,359
and where she came from,
she wouldn't say.

294
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,494
Makomo: Sabito and I,

295
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:39,565
we both
love urokodaki very much.

296
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:43,369
Tanjiro: She said that a lot,
almost like a catchphrase.

297
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:46,504
She and sabito weren't siblings.

298
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,375
They were orphans,
and urokodaki raised them.

299
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,843
Makomo: We're not alone, though.

300
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:54,179
There are lots
of other children, too.

301
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,482
They're always watching you,
tanjiro.

302
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,251
Tanjiro: She is cute,

303
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,986
but makomo's a strange girl.

304
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:02,320
Hmm.

305
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,656
Her speech is
so abstract and dreamy.

306
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:08,126
Makomo: With total
concentration breathing,

307
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,995
your blood circulation
accelerates,

308
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:12,664
because your heart rate
is faster than normal.

309
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:16,134
That causes your body
temperature to spike as well,

310
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:20,472
allowing a human to fight
with the strength of a demon...

311
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,610
So it's crucial
to expand your lung capacity.

312
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:28,746
By introducing lots of air into
your bloodstream all at once,

313
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,817
your blood gets excited,
so your bones and muscles

314
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,153
start to heat up
and grow stronger.

315
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,290
Tanjiro:
None of that makes sense.

316
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,426
So how do I learn that?

317
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:45,631
Makomo:
Train until it kills you,

318
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,166
because really,
when you get down to it,

319
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,568
there's nothing else you can do.

320
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,704
( Tanjiro panting )

321
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:56,842
So I trained 'til my arms
and legs wanted to fall off.

00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,645
'Til my lungs and heart felt
like they were going to burst,

I swung my sword.

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,582
But still...

325
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,052
Sabito kept beating me.

but, this time,
his sword was real.

330
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,207
Sabito: It took you six months,

331
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,710

like you finally belong.

He looked happy, but also sad.
