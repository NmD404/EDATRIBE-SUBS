1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,066
Inosuke: Take this!

2
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,469
Come on! Move it!

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,072
Now, you spineless coward!

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,007
Draw your sword, and face me!

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,208
( Tanjiro gasping )

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,077
- ( Blows landing )
- ( Both grunting )

7
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:15,080
( Zenitsu groans )

8
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,548
Inosuke: Fine, then.

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,350
You leave no choice,

10
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,619
but to take you out
along with that box!

11
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,388
( Zenitsu groans )

12
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:25,591
Tanjiro: Stop it!

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,563
I said stop!

14
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,564
¶

15
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,633
( singing in Japanese )

16
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,929
¶

17
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:11,069
Tanjiro: Get away!

18
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,070
Inosuke: Hmm?

19
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,305
( Tanjiro yells )

20
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,546
( Inosuke gags )

21
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,484
Zenitsu: I heard it!
He broke his ribs!

22
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,353
Tanjiro: Aren't you part
of the demon slayer corps?!

23
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,557
You must understand why Zenitsu
refuses to draw his sword,

24
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,026
because it's taboo for us

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,029
to fight each other
without provocation!

26
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,565
But here you are, giving him
a completely one-sided beating.

27
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,767
Is that fun for you?

28
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,770
You are the lowest of the low!

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,707
( Inosuke coughs )

30
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,576
( Laughing and coughing )

31
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,249
So that's how you feel?

32
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,784
I didn't realize.

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,055
In that case,
let's fight barehanded.

34
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,924
Tanjiro: No! Did you even
hear a word I just said?

35
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,925
Listen.

36
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,127
( Inosuke growls )

37
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,630
Tanjiro: We're not supposed
to fight each other in any way!

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,067
Using your hands
doesn't change things!

39
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,402
Are you listening to me?

40
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,537
- ( Inosuke growling )
- ( Tanjiro yelling )

41
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,078
( Gasps )

42
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,812
( Inosuke grunts )

43
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,082
Zenitsu: Man, look at this guy.

44
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,150
How is he able
to move like that?

45
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,220
And with some
of his ribs broken, no less.

46
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,356
( Inosuke growling )

47
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,064
- ( Grunts )
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

48
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,636
Zenitsu: If we're
being fair here,

49
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,839
Tanjiro's guilty of going
against the rules as well.

50
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,674
He broke his bones.

51
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,182
( Tanjiro gasps )

52
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,085
( Inosuke snarls )

53
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,061
Tanjiro: The attacks
he's using...

54
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,529
( Inosuke grunting )

55
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,733
Tanjiro: They're unusually low.

56
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,137
The way we're fighting,
it's almost like...

57
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,307
I'm battling
a fearsome, four-legged beast!

58
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:33,411
Get down, and go
for a low blow of your own.

59
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,813
He won't be able to dodge this!

60
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,083
( Chorus vocalizing )

61
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,552
( Tanjiro groans )

62
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,221
How is he this flexible?!

63
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,391
It doesn't even seem human!

64
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,228
Inosuke: What did you
think of that move?

65
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,097
Pretty damn amazing,
don't you think?

66
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,500
Zenitsu: Singing
his own praises like that?

67
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,169
Give me a break.

68
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,439
Inosuke: Let me demonstrate
what else I'm capable of.

69
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,941
( Laughing )

70
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,580
Tanjiro: Stop it!
What are you doing?

71
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,649
Performing a stunt like that
in your condition

72
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,317
won't be good for you!

73
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,387
Inosuke: So? What do I care?!

74
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,722
Nothing can take away
from this moment

75
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,591
and the pleasure I feel!

76
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,195
Tanjiro: But you have to think
about the future as well!

77
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,463
Inosuke: Why should I?

78
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,064
Eh?

79
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,266
Tanjiro: Now calm down!

80
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:32,671
Do you hear?!

81
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,739
( Zenitsu wails ) That sound!

82
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,275
Did both of your skulls
get fractured?!

83
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,144
( Inosuke gasping )

84
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,286
( Tanjiro stammers )

85
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,688
Zenitsu: Uh...

86
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,424
Huh?! Are you kidding me!

87
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,160
That's what you look like?!

88
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,230
Inosuke: What the hell
are you saying?

89
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:03,035
You got a problem
with my face or something?

90
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,571
Zenitsu: I don't know
what to make of you right now.

91
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,040
You've got this ripped body,

92
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,642
but such a delicate face
to go with it.

93
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,644
Inosuke: What?
Why are you obsessed

94
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,513
with my face all of a sudden?

95
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,248
Zenitsu: No! I-I'm not!

96
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,316
It was just an observation!

97
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,052
Children: Uh...

98
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,254
Tanjiro: There's nothing wrong
with your face.

99
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,923
In fact, the girlish shape,
size, and complexion

100
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,391
are quite attractive!

101
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,727
Inosuke: You're a dead man!
You wanna go?

102
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,263
Tanjiro: I don't!
I won't fight you anymore.

103
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,331
Inosuke: Come on. Head-butt me!

104
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,466
Tanjiro: No! I'm done!

105
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,268
Inosuke: I said do it!

106
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,071
Tanjiro: You're too worked up.
Why don't you just sit down?

107
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:43,341
Inosuke: I got a better idea!
How about I tell you my name?

108
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:47,011
It's Inosuke hashibira.
Don't you forget it!

109
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,613
Tanjiro:
How is that spelled, exactly?

110
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,549
Inosuke: Huh? I..

111
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,818
I don't know how
to read and write, okay?

112
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,621
All I know is that name
was written on my--

113
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,223
( gags )

114
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,559
Zenitsu: Huh? What's wrong?

115
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,494
Shoichi: Guess he froze.

116
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,163
( Inosuke stammering )

117
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,099
Tanjiro: What's the matter?

118
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,001
( Inosuke stammering )

119
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,238
( Groans )

120
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,409
( Gurgling )

121
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,712
Zenitsu: Oh, no! He collapsed!

122
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,581
Is he dead?

123
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,449
Tanjiro: No, he's not.

124
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,119
I think it's a concussion.

125
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,988
I did head-butt him
really hard, though.

126
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,457
Teruko: But are you
all right, Tanjiro?

127
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,526
- Tanjiro: Yeah.
- Teruko: Amazing!

128
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,328
Can I touch your head?

129
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,996
Tanjiro: Sure.

130
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,598
Zenitsu: That's insane.

131
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,401
There's not a single drop
of blood from Tanjiro's head.

132
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,537
- How hard could it possibly be?
- ( Inosuke gurgling )

133
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,407
Zenitsu: I mean,
look at what it did to him.

134
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,143
Teruko: Tanjiro,
your head is so hard!

135
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,111
Tanjiro: You think so?

136
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,882
( Wind blowing )

137
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,717
( Birds chirping )

138
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,960
( Inosuke groans )

139
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,029
¶

140
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,900
( yelling )

141
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,634
( Zenitsu screams ) He's awake!

142
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,570
Inosuke: Fight me! Fight me now!

143
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:19,905
Get back here, you!

144
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,840
Zenitsu: I can't believe
this is how he acts

145
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,309
right when he wakes up!
( Squeals )

146
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,310
( Teruko yelps )

147
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,879
( Inosuke growls ) Huh?

148
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,920
What are you up to? Tell me!

149
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,054
( Rocks clatter )

150
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,589
Tanjiro: We're having a burial.

151
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:38,924
Inosuke: Burial?

152
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,527
Tanjiro: Yes,
and you should help out, too.

153
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,063
The fact of the matter
is lives were lost in there.

154
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,732
What's the point
in putting things

155
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,934
that have died
into the ground like that?

156
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,737
I'm not doing that,
not on your life!

157
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,472
Forget that crap!
Let's finish our fight!

158
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,743
Zenitsu: This guy's cold.
Did he really just ask

159
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,611
what the point
in burying people was?

160
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,347
¶

161
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,680
Tanjiro: I understand.

162
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,350
You can't do it,

163
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,784
because you're in too much pain.

164
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,686
Inosuke: Huh?

165
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,356
Zenitsu: I thought
it was just the boar guy,

166
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,291
but they're both crazy.

167
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:16,294
Tanjiro: Hey, it's all right.
Everyone handles

168
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,496
their pain threshold
differently, you know.

169
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,966
Moving those who died
outside the mansion

170
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,901
and then digging graves
for their bodies

171
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,903
is extremely hard work.

172
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,773
Zenitsu, these kids, and I
will do our best,

173
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,775
so don't you worry!

174
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,777
Kiyoshi: He's so odd.

175
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,712
- Shoichi: Strange guy.
- ( Inosuke growls )

176
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,115
Tanjiro: You should
get some rest, Inosuke.

177
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,716
( Inosuke growls )

178
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,919
Tanjiro: Sorry to ask
too much of you.

179
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,588
Inosuke: Huh?!

180
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,456
Don't underestimate me, damn it!

181
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,925
I can Bury 100, no, 200 bodies!

182
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,528
I'm gonna do way more work
than any of you! Just watch!

183
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,431

184

( Yelling )

185
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,811
Teruko: What's
that strange man doing?

186
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,345
Kiyoshi: Just look
the other way.

187
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:08,280
( Shoichi grunts )

188
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,686
( Crow cawing )

189
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:18,824
Descend the mountain!
Descend the mountain!

( Cawing )

191
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,694
Shoichi: Is that crow
talking to us?

192
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,696
Kiyoshi: This is all
a bit too much.

193
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:25,697
Teruko: Yeah.

194
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,833
Crow: All right, everyone!

195
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,302
It's time to follow yours truly!

( Inosuke grunts )

198
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:35,907
Huh?

199
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,709
¶

200
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,512
hey! Where are you going?

201
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,314
Tanjiro: Uh,
we're descending the mountain.

202
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,783
Inosuke: But we're not done
with our battle yet.

203
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,518
Tanjiro: You're tired,
aren't you?

204
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,986
Come on. We're heading down.

205
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,521
Inosuke: What?!

206
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:50,989
I'm not tired at all!

207
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,992
Let's fight!

208
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,828
( Crow cawing )

209
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:00,932
Zenitsu: No, you can't!

210
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,534
I won't allow it!

211
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,002
Don't go, shoichi!

212
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:05,603
Please, you gotta stay with us!

213
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,539
I've seen how powerful you are!

214
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:10,608
I need you around
to protect me from danger!

215
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,078
Tanjiro: Stop it!
He's obviously not interested!

216
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,481
Zenitsu: Don't leave me behind,
shoichi! I beg you!

217
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,683
Tanjiro: Stop that this instant!

218

220
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,622
Hold out your hands!

( Kiyoshi screams )

224
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,762
Crow: That will ward off demons.

225
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,500
As the one with marechi, be sure
to keep that on your person.

226
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,902
Tanjiro: It smells
like Wisteria.

227
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,570
Kiyoshi: What's that?

228
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,638
Tanjiro: A flower
demons can't stand.

229
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,307
Make sure not to lose it.

230
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,975
Crow: It's a demon repellent.

231
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,311
It will keep them at bay.

232
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,713
( Inosuke snarls )

233
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,583
Kiyoshi: Tanjiro,
thank you for everything.

234
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,985
We can all get home
on our own now.

235
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,388
Tanjiro: Safe travels.

236
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,856
( Inosuke snarls )

237
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,992
Crow: Now, everyone, follow me!

238
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,529
Follow yours truly!

Inosuke: Come on, and fight me!

242
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,471
I swear I'm gonna find
your weak point

243
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:14,672
and bring you down!

244
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,674
Tanjiro: I have a name,
you know.

245
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,344
It's Tanjiro kamado!

246
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,012
All right, gonpachiro kamaboko,

247
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,614
I'm gonna bring you down!

248
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,015
Tanjiro: Who are
you talking about?

249
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,084
- Inosuke: You, of course!
- Tanjiro: No, you're not!

250
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,554
Zenitsu: 'Scuse me!
Could you keep it down, please?!

251
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,888
( Tanjiro grunts )

252
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,558
( Owl hoots )

253
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,461
( Birds trilling )

254
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,966

family crest.

( Crow caws )

256
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,703
It's time to rest!
It's time to rest!

257
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,575
You've all had a tough day!
Rest up now!

258
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,444
Tanjiro: Huh?
Are you sure that's okay?

259
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,779
Now that you mention it,

260
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,848
I have been fighting
with injuries this whole time.

261
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,516
( Crow chortles )

262
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,318
Tanjiro: Is that a laugh or...

263
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,120
Inosuke: Let's eat this thing.

264
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,355
Crow: What?

265
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,859
Woman: Yes?

266
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,796
Tanjiro: Oh. Sorry to bother you
this late at night.

267
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,598
Zenitsu: A ghost! It's a ghost!

268
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,999
Tanjiro: Quiet!

269
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,268
- Inosuke: Who the hell are you?
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

270
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,005
Woman: Should I presume
that you are all demon slayers?

271
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,873
Inosuke: We are.
What's it to you?

272
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,008
Tanjiro: Inosuke!

273
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,277
Woman: Please come in.

274
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,246
¶

275
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:33,685
Zenitsu: That little old lady
sure walks fast.

276
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,321
Woman: This is
where you'll be staying.

277
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,729
A change of clothes
to cleanse your body.

278
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,434
And a warm meal
to cleanse your soul.

279
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,636
Zenitsu: She has
to be a monster!

280
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,571
Preparing all this so quickly?
There's no way she's human!

281
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:54,572
She can't be!

282
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,975
She's a monster grandm--

283
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,378
( Inosuke gobbling )

284
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,715
Zenitsu: Use your chopsticks.

285
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,584
( Inosuke growls )

286
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,287
( Laughs )

287
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:10,788
( Laughs )

288
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,391
( Zenitsu groans )

289
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,793
Tanjiro: Uh...

290
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,595
If you're really
that hungry, Inosuke,

291
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,397
go ahead and have
this bowl as well.

292
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,398
Inosuke: Huh?

293
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,067
( Wails )

294
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,135
Tanjiro: Take it.

295
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,802
Inosuke: I refuse!

296
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,339
Zenitsu: Is this moron for real?

297
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,407
He's forgotten all about the box

298
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,942
that was so important
to him earlier.

299
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,810
Give me a break!

300
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,014
( Inosuke snarls )

301
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,817
Woman: Your bedding
is ready, gentlemen.

302
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,487
Zenitsu: Again! The monst--

303
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,820
- ( groans )
- ( Inosuke laughs )

304
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,290
I'm takin' this one here.

305
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,892
First come, first serve!

306
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,162
Tanjiro: That's fine.
You can sleep wherever you want.

307
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,563
( Inosuke groans )

308
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,031
Tanjiro: Which one
do you want, Zenitsu?

309
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,767
- Zenitsu: Uh...
- ( Inosuke yells )

310
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,635
Zenitsu: Why me?!

311
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:01,039
Woman: Our doctor
is ready to see you.

312
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:01,974
Doctor: Greetings.

313
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,309
Hmm.

314
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,310
Yes.

315
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,644
I see.

316
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,548
Well, it's bad.

317
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,053
Zenitsu: Who would have guessed?

318
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,456
All three of us
have broken ribs.

319
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,663
This bump, though,
hurts a lot more.

320
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,932
Tanjiro: Sorry.

321
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,667
Zenitsu: 'Scuse me.
Where my apology?

322
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,537
I'm hurting, too.

323
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,939
You beat the crap
out of me earlier.

324
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,473
You sorry?

325
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,674
Inosuke: Not really.

326
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:37,943
Zenitsu: Just apologize!

327
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,878
- Inosuke: Forget it.
- Tanjiro: Hey, be nice.

328
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,948
Zenitsu: Look, Inosuke,
we just won't eat with you

329
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,616
if you act that way.

330
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,018
Inosuke: Huh?
How's that related?

331
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,954
Zenitsu: Because meals
always taste better

332
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,622
when you eat together,
you know?

333
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,357
Tanjiro: Yeah, he's right.

334
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,360
Inosuke: Did the two of you
hit your heads or something?

335
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,562
Zenitsu: Like you're one
to talk about that!

336
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,365
Woman: Do you need
any assistance in there?

337
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,698
Zenitsu: Ahh! The monster!

338
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:01,967
Tanjiro: Stop that!

339
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,936
( Groans )

340
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,773
According
to what the crow told me,

341
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,508
this house
with the Wisteria family crest

342
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:14,512
belongs to a family that was
once rescued by demon slayers.

343
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:18,049
That's the reason they're
housing us free of charge here.

344
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:22,588
Still, I didn't think they would
show us this much kindness.

345
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,723
Inosuke: Pays to be with
the demon slayer corps, huh?

346
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,525
Tanjiro: Now that
I think about it,

347
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,461
what made you decide
to join the group?

348
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,929
Inosuke: Huh?

349
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,399
Zenitsu: Well, you must
have had some kind of reason.

350
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,934
Inosuke: A member
of the demon slayer corps

351
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,736
barged in on me
on my mountain,

352
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,005
so we competed
to see who was stronger.

353
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,474
I took his blade as a reward.

354
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,610
( Both groan )

355
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,479
Zenitsu: I feel sorry
for that guy

356
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,414
Inosuke: And then I heard

357
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,750
of this thing
called "final selection"

358
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,552
and the fact
that demons really do exist.

359
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,755
Tanjiro: So that's what drew you
to the demon slayer corps.

360
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,958
And, hey, you grew up
in the mountains.

361
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,559
Same goes for me.

362
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,829
Inosuke:
Don't lump me in with you!

363
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,898
I don't have anyone
I could call family.

364
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,835
Only one thing gives me
comfort in this world,

365
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,971
and that's testing
my strength against others!

366
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,475
Tanjiro: Is that so? How sad.

367
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:21,513
( Zenitsu groans )

368
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,783
Hey, Tanjiro,

369
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:29,254
there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

370
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,391
You're traveling with a demon.
What is that about?

371
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:35,494
( Tanjiro gasps )

372
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,529
¶

373
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:46,604
Tanjiro: Zenitsu, you knew,
and you still protected the box.

374
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,741
You really are a good person.
You know that?

375
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:50,942
Thank you.

376
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,544
( Zenitsu gasps )

377
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:55,547
You don't have
to compliment me like that.

378
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:58,416
( Giggles )

379
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,886
Tanjiro: I've got
a keen sense of smell.

380
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,888
That's how I knew
from the start.

381
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:07,359
You're a kind person,
Zenitsu, strong, too.

382
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:10,762
Zenitsu: Hey, I'm not
that strong. Give me a break.

383
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,499
That's why I wanted
to bring shoichi along with us,

384
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,766
but you ruined it.

385
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,368
Tanjiro: Uh, but i--

386
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:17,435
that's--well...

387
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,437
( Thumping )

388
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:20,638
( Zenitsu shrieks )

389
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,574
Wh-what's happening?!

390
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,775
Is it coming after us now?

391
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:24,910
Tanjiro: You don't
have to worry.

392
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,778
Zenitsu:
How can you be so sure?!

393
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,847
- How?! How?!
- Tanjiro: Quiet down.

394
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,517
It's the middle
of the night, Zenitsu.

395
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,920
Inosuke: Why won't
he take the bait?

396
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,856
I took his food and everything.

397
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,391
Come to think of it,

398
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:43,461
what exactly was it
that got him so mad before?

399
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:44,763
I forget.

400
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,933
( Thump )

401
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,668
( Zenitsu shrieks )
It's not even locked?!

402
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,538
- You're kidding me?!
- Tanjiro: Shh!

403
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,340
Zenitsu: P-p-protect me!

404
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,807
Someone please protect me!

405
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,876
Even you'll do, Inosuke!

406
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:58,744
Inosuke: Stay away from me!

407
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,448
( Zenitsu groans )

408
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,219
( Squeals )

409
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,223
It's escaped!

410
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,824
( Yells )

411
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,826
I-I gotta hide! I'm so scared!

412
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:16,595
Nezuko: Hmm?

413
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,498
Zenitsu: Huh?

414
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:21,967
Tanjiro: Hey, Nezuko.

415
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,869
( Nezuko sighing )

416
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,576
Zenitsu: Huh?

417
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,478
¶

418
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:35,581
( Nezuko grunts )

419
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,983
( Zenitsu gasping )

420
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,386
( Inosuke grunts )

421
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,920
( Snorts )

422
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:45,857
( Groans ) That's enough
activity for one day.

423
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:47,593
( Snoring )

424
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:48,794
Tanjiro: I'll introduce you.

425
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,397
- Nezuko is my--
- Zenitsu: Tanjiro.

426
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:52,798
Tanjiro: Huh?

427
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,600
¶

428
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:56,268
Zenitsu: You didn't.

429
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,271
Tanjiro: Hey, what's wrong?

430
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:00,672
( Electricity crackling )

431
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,808
Zenitsu: Tell me you didn't.

432
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,280
Just who do you think you are?

433
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,615
( Tanjiro gasps )

434
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,549
Zenitsu: You've been
traveling with a girl...

435
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,751
This adorable?

436
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,822
Hanging around with someone
this cute day in and day out

437
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:20,759
and been having a great time
in the process, haven't you?

438
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,494
Tanjiro: Wait a minute.
That's not--

439
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,629
Zenitsu: Well, then, why did I

440
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,431
bear all that pain
and suffering?!

441
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,699
Tanjiro, you jerk!

442
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:30,302
You getting to be all, "ooh,"
and, "mwah," with a cutie

443
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:32,570
is not what I
was toiling away for!

444
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,440
I did not put myself
in harm's way

445
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,242
to get pummeled and kicked
around by a crazy boar guy!

446
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,646
Tanjiro: Zenitsu, calm down!
What has gotten into you?

447
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,981
Zenitsu: Did you think
I joined the demon slayer corps

448
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,050
because I thought it was gonna
be all sunshine and rainbows?

449
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,918
- Tanjiro: Well, i--
- Zenitsu: Guys like you

450
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:49,655
should be erased
from this world immediately!

451
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,924
I will finally make you pay
for thwarting my marriage,

452
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,662
as well as sending my savior
and protector shoichi home.

453
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,997
You shall face justice!

454
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:03,068
Don't ever disrespect the corps!

455
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,670
- ( Inosuke snoring )
- Zenitsu: You fiend!

456
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:08,540
How could you! ( Screams )

457
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,942
Tanjiro: Zenitsu, cut it out!

458
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,078
Zenitsu:
Mock the demon slayers corps,

459
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:17,349
and you'll get sent
straight to hell!

460
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:20,486
You shall feel my wrath!

461
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:24,022
