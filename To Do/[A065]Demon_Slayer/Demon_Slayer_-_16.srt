Damn! They are
all such useless puppets.

but to unleash that one, then.

where did you all go?!

197
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,847

to come check in on me?

You're so wonderful
and adorable, Chuntaro!

205
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,930
Not as adorable as Nezuko,
but I'd say a close second!

206

I really appreciate this!

Zenitsu: I'm sorry
for everything!

How about we just start fresh
and go look for Nezuko together?

Just one more.

Inosuke: Okay. I'm gonna
do it one more time, so watch!

215
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,889
Tanjiro: All right, fine.
I'll watch.

216
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,156

I don't need them anymore!

Damn it to hell.

228
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,377

We'll reach them
before you know it.

237

Tanjiro: Now that the wind's
changed direction,

238
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,751
my sense of smell is returning.

239
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,086
Then I'll know
exactly where it is.

240
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,656
There! I'm picking up
two more scents!

241

Inosuke!

242
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,695
Inosuke: I detected that thing
before you did.

243
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,030
I'm gonna hack its head
right off its shoulders!

Where the heck are you, Tanjiro?

You, too, Inosuke.
Don't just leave me here

You know what?

259
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,215
This is starting
to make me really mad.

260
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,482
I'm gonna find Nezuko

261
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,852
and then say goodbye
to this creepy forest.

262
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,190
Nezuko!

What do we do?!

Listen closely, all right?

272

Slash from
the right part of the neck

273
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,051
to the left part of its waist.

274
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,252
It'll be tough.

275
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,921
It's a lot of mass to cover.
That said...

276

283
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,004

Tanjiro: Inosuke,
this is a tough one,

289
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,294
but we can do it.

290
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,496
If we put our heads together,

291
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,498
we'll be able to win!

You're up, Inosuke!

305
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:47,086
Inosuke: It seems like he's
got everything figured out.

306
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:50,155
I gotta say
that's pretty irritating.

307
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,558
It's almost like he
can predict the future.

308
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:58,029
It's as natural for him
as water flowing from a river.

309
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:01,300
It's not about going first
for this kid.

310
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,303
It's all about
the battle itself

311
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:08,173

like a raging current!

All right, Inosuke!
You defeated it!

So that's why
you did that, Inosuke!

327

( Mother whimpers ) No.

328
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:13,172
That doll was my fastest and
strongest, and they still won!

329
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,508
It's Rui's fault for coming
to me with his threats!

330
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,976
That's why I panicked.

331
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,845

If I die, I'll be freed.

341
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,609

it's like I'm being showered

It doesn't hurt, not at all.

350

368
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:42,955
Those eyes.

369
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:49,528
Such kind eyes.

370
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:53,132
When I was human,
I think there was someone

371
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,635
who used to look at me
with those same kind eyes.

372
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,507
I wonder who that was.

I just know that it was someone
who always cherished me.

376
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,758
I wonder...

377
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,361
How that person is doing now.

381
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,079

of the twelve kizuki,

385
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:57,196
they're here on this mountain,

386
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,864
