00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:07,405
Susamaru: I wonder how
we should kill them. ( Laughs )

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,674
I can feel the power.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,212
I can feel the blood he gave me
coursing through my veins.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,081
Yahaba: And of course
we're going to be ruthless

6
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,550
when we kill them.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,220
( Yushiro gasps ) Get down!

( Yahaba chuckles )

11
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,435
Did you decide
how we'll kill them?

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,770
Susamaru: Ruthlessly!

13
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:38,671
Hah! Hah!

23
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,571
Turns out
you were right, yahaba.

24
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:50,775
This building just materialized
out of nowhere.

25
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,311
Yahaba: Huh.
The handiwork of someone

26
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,948
using a blood demon art
that can hide objects.

27
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,784
What is this?

28
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,454
We're tracking down
a demon slayer.

29
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,856
Is he with demons?

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,259
( Susamaru laughs )
Isn't this fun?

31
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,593
( Balls ring )

32
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,863
Yahaba: I have to say, susamaru,

33
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,466
your way of doing things
is just so immature,

34
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,535
utterly careless.

35
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,736
You splattered me.

36
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:21,606
My kimono is covered with dust.

37
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,408
Susamaru: Oh, stop whining.

38
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,809
Who cares about dust?

39
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,880
My temari just uncovered
their hiding place.

40
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,883
And now the real fun begins!

41
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,487

00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,557
Stop splattering me!

44
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,492
Susamaru: Stop being so uptight.

45
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,761
Your kimono
looks just fine to me.

46
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,497
And look.

47
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,769
( Laughs )

48
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:54,973
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

49
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,708
Tanjiro: A temari?

50
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,279
Throwing a temari
caused all this damage?

51
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,618
Yushiro: That woman,
did kibutsuji send her?

52
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,321
( Susamaru laughs )

53
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,756

00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,600
Yushiro: Lady tamayo! ( Gasps )

Tanjiro: Yushiro!

57
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,343
Damn it!

58
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,812
Nezuko, the lady
sleeping in the back room,

59
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,281
take her outside,
and get her to safety!

60
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,282
( Nezuko grunts )

61
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,217
Tamayo: It's too dangerous!

62
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,353
We have a basement!
Take her there!

63
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,755
Tanjiro: Good idea.

64
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,923
- Nezuko.

66
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,562
One down. Three to go.

67
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,897
Tanjiro: Her scent is different

68
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,768
than any other demon
I've ever met.

69
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,102
It's stronger or thicker.

70
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,839
It feels heavy inside my lungs.

71
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,677
( Temari ringing )

72
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,316
Susamaru: Hmm.
There's a demon slayer

73
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,585
who wears hanafuda earrings.

74
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,587
That would be you, right?

75
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,791
( Tanjiro gasps )
They're targeting me?

76
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,527
Miss tamayo, I want you
to go find a place to hide!

77
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,929
These demons are after me.

78
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,266
Tamayo: No, tanjiro.
You need to focus on the fight.

79
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,802
Don't worry about us.

80
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,271
We'll be just fine
without your protection.

81
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,375
We're demons, too.

82
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,411
Susamaru: All righty.

83
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,281
It's all over for you!

84
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,454
Tanjiro: It'll only swerve
if I dodge it.

85
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:01,366
The fastest thrusting technique
of all ten forms.

86
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,568
Total concentration.

87
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,769
Water breathing!

88
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,572
Seventh form! Drop ripple...

89
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,508
Thrust-curve!

90
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,609
( Splashing )

91
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,713
Susamaru: Oh?
You think you can soften

92
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,616
the temari's blow
by stabbing it like that?

93
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:19,784
How cute.

94
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,320
( Rattling )

95
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,689
( Tanjiro groans )

96
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,392
How does it
move around like that?

97
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,728
It did the same kind
of weird swerve

98
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,330
when it hit yushiro, too.

99
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,734
She doesn't seem to be
putting any spin on it, though,

100
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,536
so how?

101
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:42,608
Tamayo: Yushiro.

102
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,144
Yushiro!

103
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,481
( Squelching )

104
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,689

105
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,424
( Tanjiro gasps )

106
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,559
Yushiro: Lady tamayo!

107
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,228
I tried to tell you, didn't I?

108
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,964
I said not to get involved
with a demon slayer,

109
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,366
and I was right!

110
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,303
My concealment spell
is still a work in progress.

111
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,573
You should have known that
just as well as I do.

112
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,641
I may be able
to conceal buildings

113
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,443
and people and their scent,

114
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,913
but it's not like I can hide
the fact that they exist!

115
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,581
( Tamayo grunts )

116
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,916
Yushiro:
The greater our numbers,

117
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,517
the more traces we leave,

118
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,720
and the greater the odds
that kibutsuji will find us!

119
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:32,324
Tanjiro: Those demons
got so close to us,

120
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,728
but there was no scent
until they attacked.

121
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,597
Was that yushiro's
blood demon art?

122
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,065
Yushiro: I hate
anyone who gets in the way

123
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,837
of the time I spend alone
with you. I despise them!

124
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,806
I loathe them with passion!

125
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,242
It's unforgivable!

126
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,612
( Susamaru laughs )

127
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,248
That one's babbling now.

128
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,083
Who's having fun?

129
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,819
I know I sure am.

130
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:05,290
You're about to be killed
by one of the twelve kizuki.

131
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,425
Doesn't that
make you feel special?

132
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,828
Tanjiro: Twelve kizuki?

133
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,831
Tamayo: They're directly
under kibutsuji.

134
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,534
( Susamaru laughs )

135
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,841
Tanjiro: That's a lot of arms.

136
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,710
( Temari ringing )

137
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:30,382
Susamaru: Now, then,
let the games continue

138
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,184
until morning comes,

139
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,353
until you're all dead!

140
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,596
( Yushiro winces )

141
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,931
Tamayo: If I were to cast
my spell right now,

142
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,401
it would affect tanjiro as well,

143
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:53,405
and yushiro needs time in order
to switch to attack mode,

144
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,774
but if this goes on...

145
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,944
Tanjiro: It happened again.

146
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,781
They change directions,
even without hitting anything.

147
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:06,618
( Groans )

148
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,753
If I cut them in half,

149
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:12,624
it blunts the blow,
but they still hit me anyway.

150
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,093
¶

151
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,897
two different scents of blood.

152
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,632
There are two demons,

153
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,502
and the scent
tells me where they are,

154
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,536
but I can't...

155
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,610
Miss tamayo! Yushiro, no!

156
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,246
It's no use.

157
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,848
I don't have time
to protect them!

158
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,983
Tamayo: We'll heal ourselves
soon enough!

159
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,452
Don't worry about us!

160
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,654
Yushiro: Hey,
idiot demon slayer,

161
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,924
the arrows will tell you
which direction they're going,

162
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,526
so dodge the arrows!

163
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,662
Tanjiro: What arrows?

164
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,796
Yushiro: Seriously?

165
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,932
You're telling me
you can't see them?

166
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,334
I'm lending you
my sense of sight!

167
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,802
That should at least
give you the chance

168
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,438
to kill the temari woman!

169
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,148
( Tanjiro gasps )

170
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,618
I see them now.

171
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,688
She was using these arrows
to control the temari.

172
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,491
That explains it!

173
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,429
Thanks a lot, yushiro!

174
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,699
I can see the arrows!
That helps!

175
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,834
Yushiro: Then, hurry up,
and get rid of her!

176
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,704
Tanjiro: Nezuko,
let's go outside!

177
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,707
Take care of the one
in the tree!

178
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,241
( Nezuko grunts )

179
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:40,879
( Temari ring )

180
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,384
Tanjiro: I'm the one
you came here for.

181
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,721
Susamaru: You are
the demon slayer

I knew it.

183
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:56,562
I'm going to take off that head
of yours and bring it to him.

184
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,198
( Laughs )

185
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,267
This is so much fun!

192
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,865
Hyah!

193
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,638
Third form! Flowing dance!

194
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:48,713
Miss tamayo, are these two
closely related to kibutsuji?

195
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,114
Tamayo: Possibly.

196
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,116
Tanjiro: That's what I thought.

197
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,953
Looks like we found
your first blood samples!

198

199
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:05,063
Tamayo: Which means
I have two favors to ask you.

200
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:10,135
First, I'd like permission
to study your sister's blood.

201
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,604
Second, I need more samples.

202
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,472
I'd like you
to retrieve them from demons

203
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,475
as closely related
to kibutsuji as possible.

204
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:22,147
When I say, "demons closely
related to kibutsuji,"

205
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,015
I mean demons with powers

206
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,219
such like those
of kibutsuji himself.

207
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:31,190
Extracting blood from that kind
of demon won't be easy.

208
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,462
Tanjiro: Third form!
Flowing dance!

209
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,900
Miss tamayo,

210
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,904
are these two closely related
to kibutsuji?

211
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,806
Tamayo: Possibly.

212
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,277

( Susamaru laughs )

214
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,519
You think you'll be
able to take blood from us?

215
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:05,190
I'm not really sure what kind
of schemes you're up to,

216
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,992
but there's no way
I'm going to let you

217
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,396
do anything that will
displease him whatsoever.

218

( Tanjiro gasps )

219
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,467
Susamaru: If you want blood
from the twelve kizuki,

220
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,335
then give it a shot.

221
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,137
Let's see if you can!

222
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,006
Yushiro: Watch your back!

223
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,275
Don't let your guard down!

224
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:26,344
If they really are
some of the twelve kizuki,

225
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,880
don't underestimate them.
They're more powerful

226
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:31,016
than any other demon
you've faced before!

227
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,351
Tanjiro: Right! I understand!

228
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:34,820
Keep my guard up.

229
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:39,157
I'll watch my back,
be careful, and breathe.

230
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:40,459
'Kay! Here I go!

231
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,629
Yushiro: Lady tamayo...

237
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,977
Stop stirring up so much dust.

238

Tanjiro: That didn't take long.

243
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:18,396
She can regenerate so fast.

244
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,265
The demons
during final selection

245
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,001
were a lot slower than this.

246
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,439
Susamaru: He'll be so happy
having your head as a trophy.

Yushiro: Hey, demon slayer!

254
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,966
We're gonna need you to deal
with the arrow guy first!

255

Let the rest of us
take care of the temari woman!

All right.

00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,994
Time to get those blood samples!

266
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,731
I'll fight any demon I have to
if it means

267
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,600
the medicine'll be finished
even one minute sooner,

268

you are.

Susamaru,
can you believe our luck?

We found tamayo, the fugitive.

00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,238
She'll make quite a souvenir.

Yahaba, you think four heads

303

will be enough
for us to take home?

304
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,405

We only need two,

But even if I can see

hitting him won't be easy.

Any move is pointless
unless I can hit his opening.

pinpoint precision!

to be powerful enough.

324
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,362
his arrows can change
the sword's direction.

325
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,132

the eyeballs on his hands?

326

It doesn't look like they'll
go away until they hit me,

331

and my sword
won't do anything to them.

the direction of the arrows

First, the sixth form
to envelop the arrow!

353
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,822
Then I'll use the footwork
of the third form...

354
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,491
