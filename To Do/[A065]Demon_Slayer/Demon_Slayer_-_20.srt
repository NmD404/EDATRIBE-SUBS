for generations,

somehow manifested itself
into a technique

18
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,098

I don't know if it relates
to your sister's power,

54

all the same.

( Sizzling )

186
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,858
Sister: They were all fools,
but I'm not like them!

187
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,161
And yet, I still messed up!

188
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,401
Rui. Rui!

189
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,535
Mother's been killed

190
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,671
and our elder brother, too!

191
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,709
What now? The Demon slayers
aren't far behind us.

192
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:26,678
Rui...

193
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:30,716
Sh-shouldn't we
make a run for it?

194
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,753
No.

- Rui: I've told you before.

197
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,561
I really hate it when your face
changes back like that.

Rui: What are you looking at?

201
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,570
This isn't a play, you know.

202
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,775
Sister: I only
got my face slashed.

203
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:57,810
I got off easy.

204
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:00,813

( Grunts )

00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,388
Sister: It's no use.
That won't work.

208
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,792
My ball of yarn may feel soft,
but it's also quite durable.

Sister: First, the solvent

211
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,599
will melt your clothes
down to nothing,

212
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,735
and then it'll be your turn.

213
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,805
After you're reduced to a pulp,
I will feed on your remains.

214

Shinobu: Wow! That's incredible!

215
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:33,345

The moon's quite lovely tonight,
isn't it?

Shinobu: I can see
you have no intention

223
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,369
of being my friend, now, do you?

224
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,304
Sister: No. Wait!

225
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,373
Let me explain!

226
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:05,177
Someone's--someone's
forcing me to do all this!

227
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,046
If I don't,
I'll be torn to pieces.

228
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,316
Shinobu: My,
is that really true?

229
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,251
That does sound tragic.

230
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,586
I'll save you!

231
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,188
So let's be friends!

232
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,324
Sister: You--you're
going to save me?

233
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,592
Shinobu: Of course!

234
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
But in order for us
to be friends,

235
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,397
I must ask you
a few questions first.

236
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,598
( Sister gasps )

237
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,934
Shinobu: Tell me,
my sweet child,

238
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,503
how many have you
been responsible for killing?

239
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,173
Sister: Five humans.

240
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:39,945
( Gasps ) But I was ordered to.

241
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,613
I didn't have a choice.

242
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,883
Shinobu: Now, now.
There's no need to lie about it.

243
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,552
I know the truth.

244
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,088
That spell you cast to turn
one of our men into a cocoon

245
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,957
was most impressive.

246
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:55,026
You've eaten at least 80 humans.

247
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,295
Sister: I don't know
what you're saying.

248
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,631
I've only killed those five.

249
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,567
Shinobu: I happened
to come to this place

250
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,369
from the west, you know.

251
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,037
I saw things differently.

252
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,641
It was there that I witnessed
hordes of cocoons...

253
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,444
Hanging from the trees.

254
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:17,115
The human captives inside had
been liquefied, all massacred.

255
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:22,120
In that spot alone,
I counted at least 14 cocoons,

256
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,723
14 humans, all dead and gone.

257
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,794
Oh, don't mistake me
for being angry.

258
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,796
I'm just checking
if the death toll

259
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,730
is an accurate one.

260
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,133
Sister: What good does it do
for you to confirm that?

261
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,870
Shinobu: So I can see
you receive the proper penalty

262
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,005
and be reborn.

263
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,873
- Sister: Penalty?
- Shinobu: Yes!

264
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,410
That way, you and I
can become friends.

265
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:48,013
If you go unpunished after
having taken all those lives,

266
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,749
your victims
will never receive justice.

267
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:51,950
( Sister gasps )

268
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,885
Shinobu: I could
gouge out your eyeballs

269
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:57,756
or perhaps slash your stomach
and rip out your organs.

270
00:15:57,825 --> 00:16:00,225
For every life you've taken,

271
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,228
I'll exact the same amount
of pain on you,

272
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,696
and after you've
suffered through

273
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:09,367
all of the agony required,
your sins will be forgiven.

274
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:11,970
- Let's both give it our all.
- ( Sister shuddering )

Shinobu: Don't worry, my dear!

276
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,507
You are a Demon after all,

277
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:19,044
so none of this will kill you
or leave any lingering effects.

278
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,579
Sister: Who do you think
you're kidding?!

279
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,049
Die, you damn witch!

never be friends after all.

Aw, what a pity.

00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,611
My head, it hasn't been cut off.

291
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,247
That's the sword she's using?

292
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:33,651
I see. She's too tiny
and has no arm strength,

293
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,387
so she can't behead me.

294
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,523
Her life is mine.

298
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,277
Shinobu: Just because
you haven't been beheaded,

299
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,747
don't think
that you're safe from harm.

300
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:05,317
There are those like me, who use
poison with their swordsmanship.

Demon Slayer Corps,
insect hashira, Shinobu kocho.

302
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,763
I may be the only one
among the hashira

303
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:20,766
who is unable
to decapitate demons,

304
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,569
but creating a poison
that's lethal to them,

305
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,971
that's quite impressive,
don't you think?

306
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,506
Oh! Pardon me!

307
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,709
I guess you can't hear me
if you're dead.

308
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,045
Silly me!

Murata: Just barely.

314
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,859
What happened to the Demon?

315
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,863
Shouldn't you finish it off
or something?

316
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:54,933
Shinobu: I infected her
with Wisteria poison.

317
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,268
She's already dead.

318
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,536
We can leave her to rot.

If you were curious,
I'm an expert in pharmaceutics.

320
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,942
Your clothes were dissolved,

321
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:06,678
but your body
is more or less unscathed!

322
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,514
- I'm so glad!
- ( Murata whimpering )

323
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,286
Shinobu: Now, then,
to find the whereabouts

of the Demon she mentioned

325
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:19,157
who was forcing her
to do its bidding.

326
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:22,961
Though I wonder if Tomioka
has already finished the job.

Rui: I'll kill them.
I'll kill them.

329

I'll kill
that brother and sister,

330
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,442
no matter the cost!

331
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,580
Mother: What it
that is you want, Rui?

332
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,550
What do you mean by "family"?

333
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,319
Rui: I'm not sure.

334
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:51,523
I have no memories
of when I was human, you see.

335
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:56,794
Mother: Is that why you made us
pretend to be your family?

336
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,597
Rui: I thought that,
if I could feel a family bond,

337
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,733
my memories would come back.

338

339
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,904

That's right.

341
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:15,581
