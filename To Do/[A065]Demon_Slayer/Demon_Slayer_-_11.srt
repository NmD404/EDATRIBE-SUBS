Crow: South-southeast!

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:05,804
The next place you need to go
is south-southeast!

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,872
- Tanjiro: I heard you!
- ( Crow caws )

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,208
Tanjiro: You don't have to keep
squawking it at me, okay?

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,010
- Crow: South-southeast!
- Tanjiro: I'm begging you!

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,812
I got the message, so be quiet!

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,614
- Zenitsu: Please!
- ( Crow squawks )

8

Zenitsu: Please! Please! Please!

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,286
Please marry me!

11
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,422
You know I could die
any day now!

12
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,691
Marry me so I don't die alone!

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,295
Marry me!
I'm begging you, please!

14
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:33,298
- Tanjiro: Wh-what is he doing?
- ( Zenitsu sobbing )

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
Tanjiro: What on earth?

16

( Sparrow chirping )

17
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,504

19
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,275

Zenitsu: Come on!
I'm begging you!

25
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,485
There's no one else!

26
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,353
You're the only hope
that I have left!

27
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,488
Tanjiro: Mm. Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,356
So that's it, then.

29
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,691
Okay, I'll try to help.

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,227
( Sparrow trills )

31
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,895
Zenitsu: Please!
I'm asking you again!

32
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,465
Marry me! I beg you!

33
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,434
Tanjiro: Why are you
making such a scene

34
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,635
in the middle of the road?

35
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,637
She's clearly
not interested in you!

36
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,373
Also, you're stressing
your sparrow out!

37
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,308
Zenitsu: Wait. That uniform.

38
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,711
Aren't you that guy
from final selection?

39
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,312
Tanjiro: Don't go pretending
like we know each other,

40
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,914
cause we don't, 'kay?!

41
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,383
Zenitsu: Huh?! But we have met!

42
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,519
Don't you remember?!
Don't get angry at me

43
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,521
when you're the one
with the terrible memory!

44
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,393
( No audible dialogue )

45
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,665
Tanjiro: All right.

46
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,332
You're all set
to head home again.

47
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,800
Do you need help
with anything else?

48
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,670
Girl: No. Thank you very much.

49
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,937
Zenitsu: Hang on!

50
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,672
Don't you interfere!

51
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,607
That girl
is madly in love with me!

52
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,276
The two of us
are gonna get marrie--

53
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,344
( groans )

54
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,747
Aah! Hey! Ouch! That hurts!

55
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,815
Aah! Aah! Stop! Ow! Ow!

56
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,151
Tanjiro: Hey, calm down!

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,686
( Zenitsu wails )

58
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,888
Girl: When did I say anything

59
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,622
even resembling
that I loved you?!

60
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,292
All I did was come talk to you
while you were crumpled up

61
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,694
all disheveled
on the side of the road!

62
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,962
Zenitsu: Huh?! No!

63
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,898
So are you telling me
the reason you did that

64
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,966
wasn't because you were
falling in love with me?

65
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,902
Girl: Considering that I
already have a fiancﾉ,

66
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,371
that's exactly what
I've been trying to tell you!

67
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,708
Well, you seem to be
perfectly fine now, so goodbye!

68
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,375
- ( Huffs )
- Zenitsu: W-wait!

69
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,510
Come back! Please--

70
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,379
tanjiro: Would you
give it a rest already?

71
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,714
Zenitsu: Wh-why did you
have to get in my way?

72
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,983
This had nothing to do with you.

73
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,319
Why are you
looking at me like that?

74
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,588
Stop it! You're staring at me

75
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,524
like I'm some sort of
pitiful creature or something!

76
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,994
Now listen here, you!
The reason I missed out

77
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,763
on getting married
is all your fault!

78
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,667
( Tanjiro gasps )

79
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,469
Zenitsu: Say something,
would you?!

80
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,871
Look, during my next job,

81
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,873
I'll likely die.

82
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,343
The reason is
I'm just a weakling.

83
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,477
Do you understand?

84
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,812
You have to help protect me

85
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,747
until I manage
to get married, mister.

86
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,550
Tanjiro: My name's tanjiro.
And you are?

87
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,285
Zenitsu: Tanjiro?
That's good to know.

88
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,487
I'm zenitsu agatsuma.

89
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,290
Please, you've gotta do
what you can to save me.

90
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,492
Tanjiro: Aren't you
being a bit dramatic?

91
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,894
Why did you
even become a swordsman?

92
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,696
You're acting
utterly pathetic right now.

93
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,498
Zenitsu:
That's a harsh way to put it!

94
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,368
I got conned by a woman
and racked up a lot of debt!

95
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,437
The old geezer
who took it over for me

96
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,372
happened to be
this tough-as-nails instructor!

97
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,707
He made me train
to the bone every day!

98
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,909
It was so hellish,
I just wanted to die!

99
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,579
I was hoping that'd happen
during final selection!

100
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,913
But, since I survived,

101
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,449
this nightmare
continues to haunt me!

102
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,519
Agh! I'm so scared,
terrified, frightened!

103
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,455
I just know I'm gonna
get eaten by a demon soon!

104
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,458
My brains are gonna
get sucked through my ears

105
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,059
while I'm still alive!

106
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,995
Yaaah!

107
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,863
No!

108
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,666
Please save me!

109
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,002

Tanjiro: You better?

115
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,689
Zenitsu: A bit,

116
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,291
but now I'm feeling
really hungry.

117
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,028
Tanjiro: Don't you have
any food or rations on you?

118
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,363
Zenitsu: No.

119
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,701
Tanjiro: Here.
Take one of these.

120
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,037
Zenitsu: Really?

121
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,705
Thank you so much.

122
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,510
Hmm?

123
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,446
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

124
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,582
Tanjiro: Um, that was all I had.

125
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,259
Zenitsu: Hey, uh,
you take this half.

126
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,593
Tanjiro: You sure about that?

127
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,662
Thanks a lot.

128
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,546
I know what you mean

129
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,748
when you say that you're
terrified of demons,

130
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,150
but you should try
not to worry your sparrow.

131
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,220
Zenitsu: Huh?
You're saying it was distressed?

132
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,821
How could you tell?

133
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:59,691
Tanjiro: Let's see.
He says you're always whining

134
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,426
about not wanting to go to work,

135
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,961
and you're always
hitting on girls,

136
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,629
and you snore really loudly.

137
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,498
Yup, that covers it.

138
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,699
( Sparrow chirps )

139
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,702
Zenitsu: Wait.
He said all that?

140
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,970
You can understand
bird language?

141
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,572
- Tanjiro: Yeah.
- Zenitsu: No way!

142
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,039
You've gotta be lying to me!

( Crow caws )

144
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,111
Start running! Start running!

00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,180
Run, tanjiro! Run, zenitsu!

146
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,450
Both of you must head
to your next destination!

147
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,520
Run, tanjiro! Run, zenitsu!

( Sighing )

153
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,807
Hey, tanjiro, maybe I
should just hang back for now.

154
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,542
Even if I tag along with you,

155
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,077
I'm not gonna be able
to do anything.

156
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,949
Tanjiro: The scent of demons
is getting stronger.

157
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,517
There's something up ahead.

158
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:00,819
( Gasps )

159
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,454
A house?

160
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,965
I can smell blood,

161
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,567
but it's strange.

162
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,036
Zenitsu: Wait.
You can smell something here?

163
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,105
Tanjiro: Yeah, but this is
a whole new smell.

164
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,842
Zenitsu: A smell?
I can't say I'm getting that.

165
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,710
What about that sound?

166
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,646
You're able to hear that, right?

167
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,247
Tanjiro: Sound?

168

Tanjiro: They look scared.

172

Hey, there.

173
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,329
Is there a reason
you're out here by yourselves?

( Children shuddering )

175
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,537

They're definitely terrified.

176

Guess what.

177
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,940
I have got
something really cool here.

178

Ta-da!

180
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,613
It's a friendly sparrow.

181
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,082
( Sparrow chirps )

182
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,551
Tanjiro: See? Isn't he cute?

183
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,820
( Sparrow chirps )

184
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,688
( Children sigh )

185
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,457
( Shuddering )

186
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,831
Tanjiro: Talk to me.
Did something happen?

187
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,699
Is this your house?

188
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,901
Boy: No. No, it's not.

189
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,504
This is--this house is--

190
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,106
it--it belongs to a...

191
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,441
Monster.

192
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,777
¶

193
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,447
our big brother got taken away.

194
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,315
We were walking
down the road at night,

195
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,118
and this thing
appeared in front of us.

196
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,054
It went straight
for our brother,

197
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,857
never giving us a glance.

198
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,059
Tanjiro: Did it take him
into that house?

199
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,661
Boy: Yeah. That's right.

200
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,796
Tanjiro: So you two
followed them here?

201
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,099
That's real brave. Great job.

202
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,671
Boy: We used the traces
of his blood to follow them.

203
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,105
That thing really hurt him.

204
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,075
Tanjiro: I see.

205
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,743
It'll be all right.

206
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,678
We're gonna
go defeat the bad guy

207
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,480
and save your brother.

208
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,083
Girl: Is that true?
You'll help him?

209
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,152
Tanjiro: Yes. I promise.

210
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,221
- Zenitsu: Hey, tanjiro.
- Tanjiro: Huh?

211
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,224
Zenitsu: Uh, what is
that strange sound?

212
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,761
It's really unnerving
and never stops.

213
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,630
It sounds like a drum.

214
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,566
Tanjiro: A drum?

215
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,634
I don't hear anything.

216
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,237
( Drum pounds slowly )

217
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,838

221
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:46,719
( Drumming stops )

222
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,320
( Tanjiro gasps )

223
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,188
( Zenitsu gasps )

224
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,861
( Girl wails )

225
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:57,930
Tanjiro: Just cover your eyes!

226
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,932
( Zenitsu gasping )

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
Tanjiro: Are you all right?

228
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,869
Can you hear me?

229
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,071
Just hang on!

230
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,875
This is bad.
The wound is so deep.

231
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,877
Boy 2: Even though...

232
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,280
I was able to...

233
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:19,284
E-Escape from...

234
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,086
That horrible place...

235
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,157
A-And make it here...

236
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,158
( Gasps )

237
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:30,028
Was it not enough?

238
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,631
Am I still gonna die?

239
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,169
( Tanjiro gasping )

240

¶

241
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,149
He's gone.

242
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,886
I'm sorry
you had to suffer like that.

243
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,990
Zenitsu: Tanjiro...

244
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,391
By any chance,

245
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,125
would that happen
to be these kids'...

246
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,128
( Demon roaring )

247
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,129

- ( Zenitsu whimpering )
- ( Teeth chattering )

252
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,014
Tanjiro: We couldn't save him.

253
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,885
If we'd only gotten here
a little sooner,

254
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,287
things might have
been different.

255
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,024
Uh, hey, is this your brother?

256
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,893
Boy: No.

257
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,362
No, that isn't him.

258
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:41,033
He was wearing
an orange-colored kimono.

259
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,235
( Tanjiro gasps ) I see.

260
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,938
So it's captured
more than one person.

261
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:51,309
I promise to bury you
once I return.

262
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,446
Until then, please forgive me.

263
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,981
All right.

264
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,983
Zenitsu, let's go!

265
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,952
( Zenitsu stammering )

266
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,790
Tanjiro: Look, the only people
who can help them

267
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,658
are you and me now.

268
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,594
( Zenitsu whimpering )

269
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,667
Tanjiro: All right, then.
Have it your way.

( Zenitsu shrieks )

271
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,205
Hey! Tanjiro, don't be so scary!

272
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,807
Fine! I give in! You win!

273
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,676
I'll come along with you, okay?!

274
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,813
Tanjiro: Don't let me force you.

275
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,949

Tanjiro: In case
you run into trouble,

00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,290
I'm leaving this box.

280
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,893
If you need help,
it'll protect you.

00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,162
Okay. We'll be back.

( Zenitsu shuddering )

288
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,263
So, tanjiro,

289
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,466
hey, before we continue,

290
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,267
whatever's in this place
with us,

291
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:25,170
you'll be sure to protect me
from it, won't you?

292
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,006
Tanjiro: Zenitsu,

293
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:32,010
I hate to have to tell you this,
but, in my last fight,

294
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,412
I broke a leg and a rib.

295
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:37,883
Neither of them have
fully healed up as of yet, so--

296
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,818
zenitsu: Wait! What?!

297
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,219
You have broken bones?!

298
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,288
What do you think
you're trying to do to me?!

299
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:46,224
If you're in that condition,
my fate has been sealed!

300
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,426
I'm gonna d-d-d-die!

301
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,895
( Wails ) This is awful!

302
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,763
What am I gonna do?
I'm finished!

303
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,432
It's all over for me! Yaah!

304
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,234
I can't believe
you have broken bones!

305
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,770
I'm a dead man now,
completely and utterly dead!

306
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,972
- I'm dead! I'm dead...
- Tanjiro: Zenitsu,

307
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,908
you've gotta calm down.
You'll be all right.

Zenitsu: Don't feed me
your empty promises!

309
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,046
Tanjiro: No, it's true.
You're gonna be fine,

310
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,447

Boy: W-we're sorry.

00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,923
There were sounds coming
from inside that box.

315

Tanjiro: Still, I really wish
you hadn't left it behind.

316
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,730
That thing is more precious
to me than my own life.

326
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,623
Or could it be
that we somehow moved

327
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,226
during the beat of that drum?

in this mansion,
this is the strongest one.

342
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,802
It's eaten so many.

343
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,505
This one has to be
the master of this place.

You can't go around
yelling like that!

hears you and finds us,

Let's just go wait outside!

00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,960
Why would we do that?

356

Are you trying to escape
all by yourself?

00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,234
- aren't you a little ashamed?
- ( Zenitsu wails )

359
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,902
Shoichi: It's pathetic
that you're clinging

360
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,104
to the sleeve of someone
who's younger than you.

361
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,440
Why does a coward like you

362
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,574
have a sword on your hip
in the first place?

363
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,376
( Zenitsu gags )

364
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,112
( Groans ) Those words...

365
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,047
They cut me right to my core.

366
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:23,982
( Gags )

367
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,984
Listen here, you! I'm not
gonna be useful here, anyway...

368
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,385
Shoichi: Let me go!

369
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,054
Zenitsu: So I'm just
gonna go find an adult

370
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,788
- who can help us, okay?
- Shoichi: Let go of me!

371
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,159
Zenitsu: This isn't something
us kids can resolve on our own.

372
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:36,962
Uh...

373
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,267
No way!
You've gotta be kidding me!

374
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,136
How's this not the front door?!

375
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,804
Did I misremember?
I was sure it was here!

376
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,406
This one?

377
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,607
Maybe here!

378
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,876
Or here!

379
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,420
¶

380
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:06,424
it's a monster!

381
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:07,493
( Swordsman grunts )

382
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,428
( Zenitsu wails )

383
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,570
¶

384
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,105
what the heck?!

385
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:22,508
What's with that look?!
S-Stop it!

386
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:25,110
¶

387
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:27,046
( tanjiro gasping )

388
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:30,082
( Teruko sobbing softly )

389
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,387
If it hadn't been for them,

390
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,290
if it hadn't been
for them and their meddling...

391
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,658
Tanjiro: Teruko...

392
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
You gotta try not to scream.

393
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,664
The room might change again,
so don't go far, all right?

394
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,434
Go hide behind those shelves.

395
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,542
Demon: Curses. Curses!

396
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,545
Thanks to them,
he was able to get away.

397
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,680
That prey was mine
and mine alone.

398
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:06,351
Damn them. Why do
all these unwelcome guests

399
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,087
keep barging
into someone else's home?

400
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,356
It's maddening.

401
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,024
That prey belonged to me.

402
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:17,296
I found it with my own
two hands on my own property.

403
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,368
¶

404
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,436
those filthy rats.

405
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,372
I'll make them pay.

406
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,374
Tanjiro: Hey, you, listen up!

407
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:33,311
I'm a demon slayer,
rank mizunoto, tanjiro kamado!

408
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,381
It's my duty to slay you now!

409
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:39,318
Demon: A child with marechi
that I found myself!

410
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:45,591
Tanjiro: Got him.

411
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,125
( Drum beats )

412
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,594
- ( Gasps )
- ( Rumbling )

413
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:49,728
( Teruko screams )

414
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:52,998
Tanjiro: Teruko! ( Gasps )

415
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,900
¶

416
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,737
I thought this might happen.

417
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:01,139
The room's been flipped.

418
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,475
So this is his blood demon art.

419
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,111
This entire mansion
is his territory.

420
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,481
( Gasps ) What's this?

421
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,684
There's an odd scent,
but it's not a demon.

422
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,753
( Swordsman laughing wildly )

423
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,756
Better watch out,
'cause, ready or not,

424
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,559
here I come!

425
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,129
( Woman vocalizing )

426
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:26,298
¶

427
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,234
( tanjiro gasps )

428
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:30,702
Who is this guy?

429
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,738
He's wearing a boar's hide.

430
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:39,144
And he's
wielding nichirin swords.

431
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,382
Swordsman:
All right, you monster,

432
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:47,385
die on the battlefield,
and serve as my catalyst

433
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,455
so that I may become
even more powerful

434
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,589
and soar to new heights!

435
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,659
Demon: Infuriating.

436
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,593
Just infuriating!

437
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,395
( Tanjiro gasps )

438
00:19:57,465 --> 00:19:59,331
Swordsman:
Hope you're ready for me,

439
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,767
'cause I'm comin' through!

440
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,935
¶

441
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,771
