Tanjiro: Pardon me, sir.

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,007
Would it be all right
if I took that basket

4
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,009
and some straw and bamboo?

5
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,612
Man: You're more than welcome,
for all the good it'll do you.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,880
The basket's full of holes.

7

Tanjiro: Thank you.
I'll gladly pay you for it.

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,018
Man: No, you don't
have to do that.

9
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,620
I don't need it anyway.

10

11

for the straw and bamboo.

12

Is my demon kid sister
turning into a mole now?

34
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,773
Tanjiro: And she doesn't look
very happy about it, either.

35
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,044
Guess she really wants
to avoid the sun.

36
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,912
Hang on just a second.

37
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,719

38
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,787
You think you could fit in here?

39
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:06,191
I want to try to keep moving
during the day, too,

40
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,326

Tanjiro: Uh, guess not.

46
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,344
I can't believe
how grown-up she is.

47
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,014
Seems like yesterday
she was half that size.

48
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,216
Eh?

49
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,351
Hey, uh, nezuko,

50
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,755
remember how you
got really big the other day?

51
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,756
I've got an idea.

52
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,024
Do you think
you could get smaller?

53
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,227
Come on, nezuko.

54
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,028
Get smaller for me.

Woman: Mount sagiri?

63
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,451
If you really want to go there,

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,388
the fastest way
is over that mountain.

65
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,323
But the sun's about to set,

66
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:14,126
and you're hauling
an awful lot of luggage.

67
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,061
It's dangerous.

68
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,195
Tanjiro: Please don't worry.

69
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,396
I'll be careful.

70
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,599

have been going missing

It's a temple.

77
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,354
Looks like
the light's been left on,

78
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,156
so somebody must be there.

79
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,557

This path can be pretty rough.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,367
Somebody must be hurt!

is gonna have to pay.

Not bad, kid.

105
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,103
Just a little scratch, though.

106
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,805

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,108
Stabbing the head won't work,

188
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,777
so I'll have to crush it.

189
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,979
¶

190
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,853
I probably have to crush
his skull completely,

191
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:52,791
which means hitting him
with this rock over and over.

192
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,059
I bet he'll suffer.

193
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,731
Isn't there any way for me
to finish him off with one blow?

194
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,005
( Man sighs )
This kid's not going to cut it.

195
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,943
He's far too kind
and far too indecisive.

196
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,746
He stands against a demon,

197
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,615
yet the scent
of kindness remains.

198
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,885
He still has empathy,
even for a demon.

199
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:25,624
Giyu, this boy
will never make it.

200
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,962
( Demon groans )

201
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,229
( Gasps )

202
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,232
I blacked out
for a second there.

203
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,901
Does that mean
that my body's dead?

204
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,937
I think I'm gonna be sick.

205
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:43,708
You bastard, I'll kill you!

206
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,843
Get over here!

207
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,645
I'll devour you, damn it!

208
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,982
Now get over here where I
can reach you, you little brat!

209
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,184
- Hey, aren't you...
- Tanjiro: I took too long.

210
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,918
The sun's already coming up.

211
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,788
Demon: I am gonna enjoy
eating you more than--

212
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,790
yaah! ( Gasps )

213
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,159
( Screaming )

214
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,801
( Tanjiro gasps )

215
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,269
It only takes
that much sunlight to melt him?

216
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,439
No wonder nezuko was hiding.

217
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,342
Nezuko?

218
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,344
Nezuko!

219
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,146
( Gasping )

220
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,287
( Sighs )

221
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,156
( Nezuko groans )

222
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,860
Nezuko: You're all right.

223
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,031
Eh?

224
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,100
Hang on. Where's the old guy?

225
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,103
( Footsteps approaching )

226
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,712
He's holding a burial
for the people who got killed.

227
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,719
Excuse me.

228
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:05,990
Urokodaki: My name
is sakonji urokodaki.

229
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:09,661
You're the one giyu tomioka
sent my way, correct?

230
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,398
( Tanjiro gasps )
I am! I'm tanjiro kamado,

231
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,200
and my sister's name is nezuko.

232
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,935
Urokodaki: Tanjiro...

233
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,839
What do you intend to do
if your sister eats a human?

234
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:23,876
( Tanjiro gasps )

235
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,418
Urokodaki:
You're too indecisive.

236
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:37,155
You must learn
to make decisions quickly.

237
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,959
That's why you failed to kill
that demon before daybreak.

238
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,828
Do you know
why it took you so long

239
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,164
to answer my simple question?

240
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,368
Because your resolve
is too weak.

241
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,105
There are two things you must do
if your sister eats a human.

242
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,907
First, you kill her.

243
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,309
Then slit your own belly
and die.

244
00:12:57,378 --> 00:13:02,314
That's what traveling alongside
a demon like your sister means.

245
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:05,383
But you must never
allow this to happen,

246
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,920
no matter the cost.

247
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:11,123
Your sister taking the life
of an innocent person

248
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:14,326
is the one thing
that can't happen, ever!

249
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:17,930
Have I made myself
perfectly clear?

250
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:18,931
Tanjiro: Yes!

251
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,399
Urokodaki: Very well.

252
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,002
I will test
whether or not you are fit

253
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,738
to become a member
of the demon slayer corps.

254
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,208
Carry your sister,
and follow me!

255
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,043
( Tanjiro panting )

256
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,879
¶

257
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:44,088
So fast. But I thought
he was an old man!

258
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,092
And, still, I can't hear
his footsteps at all!

259
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:52,096
Nezuko, the ride may be bumpy,
but just hang on.

260
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:55,801
But then, you always
did know how to be patient.

261
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:59,104
Didn't you, nezuko?

262
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,375
Fixing your kimono again?

263
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,178
That settles it.
We'll have to buy you a new one.

264
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,981
Nezuko: No, no,
it's fine, really!

265
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,983
This kimono is my favorite.

266
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,318
Besides, it's not important.

267
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,054
I'd rather feed
our brothers and sisters.

268
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,790
( Giggles )

269
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,993
Tanjiro: I swear, I'll turn you
back into a human,

270
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,997
and then I'm gonna buy you
a beautiful kimono!

271
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,467
Everything I wasn't able
to do for the others,

272
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,469
I'll do it all for you!

273
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,372
( Panting )

274
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,945
Okay. Does this--
does this mean--

275
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:44,016
please tell me this means
that I passed the test.

276
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,157
Urokodaki:
We're just beginning the test.

277
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,959
We'll be climbing a mountain.

278
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,929
( Tanjiro gasps )

279
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,167
Urokodaki: I promise I'll
take care of your sister for you

280
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,068
while you're gone.

281
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,971
Tanjiro: I do
appreciate that, sir.

282
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,274
( Bird warbles )

283
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,314
( Animal bugles )

284
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:19,317
( Tanjiro panting )

285
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,186
Oh, man.

286
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,989
I'm so exhausted,
my legs are starting to buckle,

287
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,725
and I'm getting dizzy, too.

288
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:32,397
Urokodaki: Now find your way

289
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,333
back to my house
at the foot of the mountain.

290
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,336
This time,
I won't wait until daybreak.

291
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,338
( Wind gusting )

292
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,340
Tanjiro: Huh?

293
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,309
That's the test?

294
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,079
Uh...

295
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,013
I get it.

296
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,484
Because of the fog,
he thinks I might get lost.

297
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:56,088
All I have to do
is get back by daybreak?

298
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:59,157
No problem,
not with my sense of smell.

299
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,860
I've memorized
Mr. Urokodaki's scent.

300
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,732
( Gasps )

301
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:14,173
( Grunts ) What the?!

302
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,509
( Yells )

303
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,378
( Birds flapping, squawking )

304
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,381
( Groaning )

305
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,853
A tiger pit?

306
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,923
Of course.

307
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,525
There are traps
all over the mountain.

308
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,794
That's why this is a test.

309
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,831
( Gasps ) Oh, no!

310
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:41,367
( Grunts )

311
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,538
Crap, crap, crap.

312
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,407
If I keep
walking into these traps,

313
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,610
I'll never make it
down the mountain by morning.

314
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,479
Not to mention,
besides the traps,

315
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,214
the air here is--

316
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,951
the air is thin
on this mountain,

317
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,154
a whole lot thinner than
on the mountain where I grew up.

318
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,023
It's no wonder I feel so dizzy.

319
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:06,825
I can't breathe.

320
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,561
I hope I can make it.

321
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,030
I might pass out.

322
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,266
No, I have to make it!

323
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,302
Control your breathing.

324
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,571
Then sniff out
all of those traps.

325
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,241
¶

326
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,382
( Gasps )

327
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,220
( Grunting )

328
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,198
Yes, got it!

329
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,199
Piece of cake!

330
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,135
These traps were set by a human,

331
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:52,404
which means their scent
sticks out to me!

332
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,112
But I guess...

333
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,016
That doesn't solve
all my problems,

334
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,084
because i'm
still not athletic enough

335
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,286
to dodge
every single one of them!

336
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:12,290
I'll make it back,
no matter what...

337
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,292
For nezuko!

338
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,128
¶

339
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,015
( Panting )

340
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,790
I made it...

341
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,359
Back down.

342
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:53,399
Giyu: Dear urokodaki, sir,
forgive the intrusion.

343
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,134
There's a boy headed your way

344
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,402
in need of instruction.

345
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,238
He wants to be a demon slayer.

346
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,276
He was fearless enough
to try to attack me unarmed.

347
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:08,280
A demon killed his family,

348
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:12,016
except for his younger sister,
who's been turned,

349
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:15,287
but I'm certain
she will not attack a human.

350
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,490
They're different.

351
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,960
I can sense
something about these two.

352
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:26,431
The boy has a keen sense
of smell, much like yourself.

353
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,235
So maybe, just maybe,

354
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:33,505
he'll be able to find a way
to break through.

355
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:36,342
I'm asking for you
to train this boy.

356
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,178
This may seem
like a frivolous request,

357
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,614
but please humor me.

358
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,585
If I'm not mistaken,

359
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,487
this will all
make sense one day.

360
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,456
Take care of yourself.

361
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:55,361
Yours truly, giyu tomioka.

362
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,268
( Tanjiro breathing heavily )

363
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,450
Urokodaki: You're now
