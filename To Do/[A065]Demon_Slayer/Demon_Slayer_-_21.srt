19

Rui: Since the day I was born,

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,060
I've always been very frail.

21
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,230
I couldn't run.

22
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,300
Even just walking
was a struggle for me.

23
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,169
Eh?

24
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,638
( Narrating ) That is...

25
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,340
Until Master Muzan appeared.

Kibutsuji: You poor thing.

28
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,583
I'll save you
from this harsh life.

29
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,491
Rui: My parents
weren't happy about it.

30
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,396
Since I'd acquired
a strong body,

31
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,466
I could never
expose myself to sunlight,

32
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,334
and of course...

33
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,203
I had to devour humans.

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,476
Father: What have you done?

35
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,811
What on earth
have you done, Rui?

36
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,047
Answer me!

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,451
( Mother sobbing )

38
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:40,425
Rui: Long ago,
I heard a wonderful story.

39
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,697
There was once a Father who died

40
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,266
trying to save
his drowning child.

41
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,635
( Child crying )

42
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,972
( Wailing )

43
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,308
Rui: I was deeply moved.

44
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:02,380
Such astounding display
of parental love, a true bond.

45
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,847
This Father who drowned

46
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,317
had fulfilled his role
as a guardian wonderfully,

47
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,122
but I wasn't bestowed
the same kind of devotion.

48
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,424
( Father crying )

49
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,531
Rui: When it came
to my own parents,

50
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,334
they tried to kill me.

51
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,335
( Mother crying )

52
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,803
Rui: All my Mother did was cry,

53
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,240
never lifting a finger
to protect me.

54
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,545
( Squelch )

55
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,623
They must have been imposters.

56
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,461
Our bond wasn't the genuine one
at all, I thought.

57
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,566
Mother: I'm...Sorry.

58
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,437
Rui: She's saying something.

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,306
I thought she was dead.

60
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,708
Mother: I'm sorry...

61
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,512
That I couldn't give you
a strong, healthy body.

62
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,114
( Rui gasps )

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,249
( Narrating ) Those...

64
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,787
Were the last words
my Mother ever spoke to me.

65
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,188
She was dead.

66
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,392
Father: Rui, listen.

67
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,695
We're going to die with you!

68
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,332
Rui: I was so enraged
he had tried to kill me,

69
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:31,602
the meaning
of his words escaped me.

70
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,338
But I came to realize
soon after

71
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,607
he intended
to atone on my behalf

72
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,143
for the sin
of having killed someone,

73
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,579
in the form
of taking his own life.

74
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,421
It was a genuine bond,

75
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:54,192
and that night, I had severed it
with my own two hands.

76
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,829
After all that, however,

77
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,032
Master Muzan gave me
words of encouragement.

78
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,502
Kibutsuji: It was
all your parents's fault

79
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,571
for refusing to accept you
for who you are.

80
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,407
Take pride in your own power.

81
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:15,379
Rui: I had no other choice
but to see it that way.

82
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,682
I couldn't bear
the weight of what I'd done.

83
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,351
( Sobs )

84
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:25,289
I knew that I only
had myself to blame.

85
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,133
Every single day,

86
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,671
I missed my parents so much,
I could barely stand it.

87
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,275
Even after crafting
a family of my own,

88
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,676
that emptiness remained.

89
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,746
Because I was the strongest,

90
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:52,550
I couldn't depend on anyone
to protect me, no one.

91
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,686
The more powerful I became,

92
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,357
the more distant my memories
of being human became as well.

93
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,093
I began losing sight

94
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,362
of what it was I wanted
in the first place.

95
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,230
¶

96
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,841
I sought out a bond that I was
never able to claim for myself,

97
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,446
not in my old life,
nor the new one I created.

( Tanjiro gasps )

99
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:36,127
This body is giving off a scent,

100
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,430
one of grief too overwhelming
for him to bear.

101

102
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,750

Hands as gentle as sunbeams.

104
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,692
I remember now, clear as day.

105
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,561
I had wanted to apologize.

106
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,765
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,032
I was...

108
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,201
I was to blame for everything.

109
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,005
I hope you can forgive me.

110
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:25,643
I've killed
so many people, though.

111
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,613
Surely I'm going to hell,
aren't I?

112
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,784
Father, Mother...

113
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,687
I can't go to the same place
as you, can I?

114
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,157
Father: That's not true.

115
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:45,062
We'll be together,
no matter where you go.

All of it was my fault.

Tomioka: Don't waste
your sympathy.

132
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,326
It was a demon.

133
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,796
The fact it looked like a child
makes no difference.

134
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:57,334
It lived for decades,
terrorizing our people.

135
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:58,802
Tanjiro: If it's for the sake

136
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,138
of avenging those
who were killed,

137
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,141
to make sure
there are no more victims,

138
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,277
I won't hesitate

139
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,146
to bring my blade down
on any demon's neck.

140
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,149
But when it comes to those
who felt despair and regret

141
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,085
from the actions
they took as a demon,

142
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,187
I will never disrespect them!

143
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,024
Because at one time
or another...

144
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,762
They were human,
no different from me!

145
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,632
So please don't step
on his remains!

146
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,769
They're not hideous monsters
at all.

147
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:35,506
Instead, demons are
hopeless creatures,

148
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,775

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,525
Tomioka: I don't--

185
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,195
I don't think I'm disliked.

186
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,363
( Tanjiro gasps )

187
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:43,401
Shinobu: Oh, dear.
I do apologize.

188
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,070
You're only just hearing
about this now, then?

189
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:49,374
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for you to find out this way.

190
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,176
( Tanjiro yells )

191
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,678
( Groans )

192
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,015
- Shinobu: Boy!
- Tanjiro: Yes, ma'am!

193
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,084
Shinobu: What you're protecting
there is actually a demon,

194
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,420
so please move away
before you get hurt.

195
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,288
Tanjiro: No. You're mistaken!

196
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,557
Well, you're not mistaken,

197
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,159
but she's my little sister!

198
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,429
She's my sister,
and that's why...

199
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,565
Shinobu: Oh, my.
Is that really true?

200
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,500
You poor thing.

201
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,637
In that case,
so she won't suffer,

202
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,907
I'll use a gentle toxin
in order to kill her.

203
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,909
( Tanjiro gasps )

204
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,611
Tomioka: Can you move?

205
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,449
Even if it's difficult,
you need to go.

206
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,517
Take your sister, and run.

207
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,153
Tanjiro: Tomioka...

208
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,521
Thank you.

209
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,123
I appreciate this!

210
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,526
Shinobu: Did you...

211
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,528
Just break
the rules of the Corps?

212

213
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,500
( Tanjiro panting )

214
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:59,076
My whole body is aching so much,
I wanna scream,

215
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,280
but I have to keep going
and endure it!

216
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:05,683
Endure! Endure! Endure! Endure!

217
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,585
( Nezuko sighing )

218
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,155
Tanjiro: Does this mean...

219
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,691
I'm gonna have to leave
the Demon Slayer Corps?

220
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,693
Even if she's my sister,
there's no way

221
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,529
they'd let one of their
swordsmen travel with a demon!

222
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,236
Shinobu: I see you're
dead serious about this.

223
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:29,140
Who would have thought a hashira
would defend a demon?

224
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:34,378
Whatever your intentions are,

225
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,246
I'm afraid
I don't feel like playing

226
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,248
this game of stalling for time,

227
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,718
and so good day to you.

228
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,122

¶

230
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,532
Shinobu: Is this your attempt
at catching up with me?

231
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,403
( Giggles )

232
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:06,010
I don't have any objections
to you trying to stop me,

233
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:08,980
but don't forget there's
someone else to watch out for.

234
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,156
Tanjiro: Don't stop running!

235
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,623
Keep on moving!

236
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,260
You gotta run
as far away as you can!

237
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,564
( Groans )

238
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,102
Damn it! What just happened?

239
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,839
I wasn't aware
of my surroundings.

240
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:35,707
Nezuko!

241
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,509
A Demon Slayer?

242
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,181
( Grunts )

243
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,450
Get out of here, Nezuko!

244
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,586
Run away as fast as you can!

245
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,289
Don't get caught,
no matter what! Hurry!

247
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,268
Slayer: Did she
just shrink into a child?

248
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,279
She's just running away

249
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,282
without even
throwing out an attack. Why?

250
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,151
( Nezuko panting )

251
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,353
Slayer: Well, it doesn't matter.

252
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,490
My orders
are to slay this demon.

253
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,295
Shinobu: Tomioka...

254
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,831
There's something I want to say.

255
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,367
Since the purpose of my attack
was to slay a demon,

256
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,769
it certainly
wouldn't be construed

257
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,638
as a violation of the Corps,

258
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:44,575
but what you're doing
is clearly against the rules.

259
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,645
You're preventing me
from slaying a demon.

260
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,714
What are your intentions here?

261
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:56,186
Don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

262
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,722
This will be your final warning.

263
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:00,224
At least give me
some sort of reason.

264
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,333
Tomioka: As I recall,
it was two years ago.

265
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,403
Shinobu: Are you about
to go into a long-winded story

266
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,205
from the past just to spite me?

267
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,743
It's because of what I said
to you earlier. Is that it?

268
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,278
( Tomioka groans )

269
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,814

Kasugai:
Message! Message! ( Caws )

271
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,487
I have a message
from headquarters!

272
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:33,291
Tanjiro and Nezuko
are to be taken into custody

273
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,093

to headquarters!

Kasugai: Tanjiro
and the demon Nezuko

are to be taken into custody and
brought back to headquarters!

278

Kasugai 2: Tanjiro,
dressed in a checkered haori,

with a scar on his forehead!

280
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:53,177
Nezuko, a demon girl
with a bamboo muzzle!

Kakushi 1: All right,
let's bring him in.

290
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:25,343
Kakushi 2: Look. His jawbone
seems to be broken, doesn't it?

291
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,379
( Kakushi 1 sighs )
I feel bad about tying him up.

Wh-who the hell is this?

Kakushi 4: I don't know.
A demon? No, it couldn't be.

295
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,557
Kakushi 3: Is it human?

296
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,626
Kakushi 4: He's wearing
our uniform trousers.

297
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:43,761
Kakushi 3: Oh, wait.

298
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,430
This is a mask. He is human!

Kakushi 4: All right,
let's bring him in.

been beaten up really bad.

Kakushi 4: Why's he
strung up like this?

302

Inosuke: There was
nothing I could do.

303
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:05,583
On my own, I couldn't
bring down even a single demon.

You know what?

305
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,988

Who are these people?

309
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:29,207
They seem to be cleaning up
this place really efficiently.

310
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,341
And that girl there,

311
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,078
isn't she the girl
from final selection?

312
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:35,813
She has the same kind
of hair ornament

313
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,415
as the lady who wrapped us up.

bring them as well?

Slayer: Yes,
go to the butterfly mansion.

316
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:45,689
I'll be hunting down
the demons here,

317
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,625

Zenitsu: I think
I've heard of these guys.

They're called the Kakushi.

of the Corps's
battles with demons.

322
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,570
I've heard
that most of their members

aren't quite as polished.
