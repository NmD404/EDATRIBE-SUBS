Damn it.
The face of this demon slayer

Why? Why did I do it?

Huh?

What for?

supposed to pick one?

laid eyes on ore.

I can't tell the difference
between any of them.

And a fool.

180
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,949
I couldn't even
get a demon to talk to me.

181
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:34,753
All any of them
wanted to do was kill me.

Ah, nezuko. I'm sorry.

183

I'm no closer to finding a cure,

184
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,497
to making her human again.

185
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,999
- ( Bell rings )
- ( No audible laughter )

186
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,202
( Groans )

187
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,840
My uniform feels heavy.

188
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,908
I wanna get home...

189
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,111
But every part of me hurts.

190
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,083
( Grunting )

191
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,237
( Panting )

192
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,408
I made it.

193
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,010
Nezuko.

194
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,244
Urokodaki.

195
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,117
( Gasps )

196
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:43,755
( Gasps )

197
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,090
Nezuko!

198
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,260
It's you! You're awake!

199
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,163
Nezuko!

200
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:52,998
( Groans )

201
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,510
( Wails )

202
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,646
Why'd you do that?

203
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:10,181
Why'd you have to sleep
for so long?

204
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,851
I thought you were
never gonna wake up!

205
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,323
I was afraid
you were gonna die!

206
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,864
Urokodaki: You're here.

207
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,067
You came back alive.

208
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,035
( Tanjiro weeping )

209
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,275
( Birds warbling )

210
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,145
¶

211
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,413
urokodaki: You did it.

212
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:44,149
You were able to kill
that mutated demon.

213
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,250
Tanjiro: Yes.

214
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,121
Urokodaki: Then, it's over.

215
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:53,959
I'm truly impressed
that you made it back.

216
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:54,994
Tanjiro: Thanks.

217
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:58,830
Urokodaki: You should know

218
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,100
there are
different kinds of demons.

219
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,235
The blood demon art
is a special spell

220
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,306
that some use
to give them abilities.

221
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,775
- Tanjiro: Eh?
- Urokodaki: You may end up

222
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:13,244
having to face some of them
in the near future as well,

223
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,914
and fighting
against supernatural abilities

224
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:19,384
will be more difficult
than anything you've done.

225
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:24,123
Still, tanjiro, I have no doubt
that you'll be just fine.

226
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,590
( Tanjiro gasps )

227
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:26,458
Right.

228
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,330
So it seems like nezuko's

229
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,732
a whole lot different
from other demons.

230
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:37,336
Do you think that's because of
this bloody art thingie, then?

231
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,539
Urokodaki: No, I think
it's something else.

232
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,810
I wouldn't call that an example
of the blood demon art.

233
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:47,012
This is only a guess,

234
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,282
but I believe nezuko can recover
her strength by sleeping,

235
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:55,054
instead of consuming human flesh
as other demons do.

236
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,461
Tanjiro: Don't worry.
I'll protect you, nezuko.

237
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:13,305
( Bells tinkling )

238
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:22,381
Mm?

239
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,350
¶

240
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:32,191
Hi there.

241
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,260
Haganezuka:
My name is haganezuka.

242
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,129
I've forged
tanjiro kamado's sword.

243
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,330
I am here to deliver it.

244
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,132
Tanjiro: Oh!

245
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,670
Sorry. I'm tanjiro kamado.

246
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,072
Come in.

247
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,674
Haganezuka:
This is a nichirin sword.

248
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,410
I forged it myself.

249
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:52,611
Tanjiro: Um...

250
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,546
Do you wanna come in,
have some--

251
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,548
haganezuka: The materials
for this kind of sword

252
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,351
only come from the mountain
closest to the sun,

253
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:05,624
made of scarlet iron sand
and scarlet ore, unique.

254
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,693
They produce steel
that can absorb sunlight.

255
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:10,495
Tanjiro: Wow, really?

256
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:15,500
Haganezuka: You see, mount yoko
is bathed in sunlight all day,

257
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,568
never a cloud in the...

258
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,103
Urokodaki: The man still refuses

259
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,972
to listen to a word
anyone else says.

260
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,307
- Haganezuka: Eh?
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

261
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,245
- A clown mask?
- Haganezuka: Hmm? Hmm?!

262
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:30,515
Hey, you're a child
of brightness, aren't you?

263
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,252
( Chuckles )
Well, isn't that lucky?

264
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,388
Tanjiro: Uh, my parents's names
were tanjuro and kie.

265
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,258
Haganezuka:
That's not what I mean.

266
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:44,129
You know how your hair and eyes
have a reddish hue to them?

267
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,266
When a family that works
with fire has a child like you,

268
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,602
it's considered lucky
and cause for celebration.

269
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,605
Tanjiro: Is it, really?
I had no idea.

270
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,406
Haganezuka: That means
there's a good chance

271
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,342
this sword will turn red.

272
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,478
Right, urokodaki?

273
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,946
Urokodaki: Yes.

274
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,153
Haganezuka: Come on.
Draw it, already.

275
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,422
Nichirin swords
are also referred to

276
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,757
as "color changing katanas,"

277
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,693
because,
depending on the bearer,

278
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,227
they change color.

279
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,096
Tanjiro: Eh?

280
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,610
( Sighs )

281
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,314
( Gasps )

282
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:44,656
Haganezuka: Black?!

283
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,257
Urokodaki: That's interesting.

284
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:49,394
Tanjiro: Why? Does turning black
mean something bad?

285
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,530
- ( Haganezuka shuddering )
- Tanjiro: Is it unlucky?

286
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:55,066
Urokodaki: No, no. It's just
that it's a little unusual.

287
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,469
You don't see it often.
It's pitch-black.

288
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,204
( Haganezuka gags )

289
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,605
But I was really hoping

290
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,408
I'd get to see
a sword turn bright red!

291
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,076
Damn it!

292
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,078
- ( Shrieks )
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

293
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:10,081
Ouch! Hey, let go!

294
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,350
Stop! Please! Ow!

295
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,818
How old are you, anyway?

296
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,486
Haganezuka: I'm 37!

297
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:16,488
( Crow squawking )

298
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:19,224
¶

299
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,026
tanjiro: Huh?

300
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,963
Crow: Tanjiro kamado,

301
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,965
I bring you orders.

302
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:29,568
Tanjiro: Huh? It can talk?

303
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:33,238
Crow: You must go to a town
northwest of here,

304
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,240
and hurry.

305
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,909
Young girls are disappearing.

306
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,244
( Tanjiro gasps )

307
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,580

00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,415
( chorus vocalizing )

309
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:48,420
( No audible dialogue )

310
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:59,464
Crow: Night after night,
at least one of them vanishes!

311
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:04,469
You must hunt down the demon
responsible and destroy it!

312
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:09,340
Tanjiro kamado,
prepare yourself well!

313
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,210
This is your first assignment

314
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:14,546
as a member
of the demon slayer corps!

315
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,615
Tanjiro: All right.

316
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:17,583
It's time.

317
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,722
