1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,537
Tanjiro: The twelve kizuki
should possess

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,739
a high amount
of Kibutsuji's blood.

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,208
If I can extract it,

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,811
the medicine that'll help
Nezuko will be finished sooner.

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,815
( Gasps )
Inosuke's still back there.

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,488
Inosuke: So did you
take out that monster?

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,158
Tanjiro: Hey, are you okay?
You're bleeding.

8
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,560
Inosuke: I asked you if you
defeated that thing or not!

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,162
Tanjiro: Uh, yeah, I did!

10
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,230
But enough about that.
Your wounds--

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,498
Inosuke: Don't go showering me

12
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,634
with your mushy sensitivity
and kindness!

13
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,236
I don't need it. You got that?

14
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,774
After all, anything you can do,
I can do, too!

15
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,442
Before you know it,
my head will be--

16
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,245
my head will be
even harder than yours.

17
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,380
Not to mention that--

18
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,683
not to mention--
not to mention...

19
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,918
Tanjiro: He's not doing well.

20
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,855
And I couldn't save
our other friends, either.

21
00:00:56,857 --> 00:01:01,226
That woman gave off a scent
of terror and suffering...

22
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,528
¶

23
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,498
enough to make her
yearn for death.

24
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,206
What is it
about this mountain, anyway?

25
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,475
- A Demon family living here...
- Hey, stay still, Inosuke.

26
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,143
As well as one
of the twelve kizuki?

27
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,278
Inosuke: Cut it out!
I'm totally fine, all right?

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,649
Tanjiro: I didn't think demons
gathered together like that.

29
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,253
Zenitsu: Ouch!

30
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,492
Ow!

31
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,161
Something just pricked me.

32
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,231
What the hell?
I'm so frustrated.

33
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,501
I can't find Tanjiro
or Inosuke anywhere!

34
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,836
Where did they go?

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,838
Great! Now what?

36
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,306
Something really stinks
around here, too! Gross!

37
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,441
( Chuntaro squeals )

38
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,910
Zenitsu: I think I'm gonna cry.

39
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,313
And the sound of these spiders
running around is so creepy.

40
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,449
I'm sure they're just doing
their best to survive,

41
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,650
the same as me, but still!

42
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,321
Be quiet! Stop moving around!

43
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,656
¶

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,794
what am I even looking at?!

45
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,463
( Singing in Japanese )

46
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,099
¶

47
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,794
¶

48
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:49,501
( Zenitsu shrieks )

49
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,970
Why did that spider
have a human face on it?!

50
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,706
What is happening right now?!
What is happening?!

51
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,710
Please be a dream!
Please be a dream!

52
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,446
If I wake up right now,
I promise to work harder!

53
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,181
If I were to wake up
in the presence

54
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:06,585
of my precious Nezuko,
then I'll do anything!

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,386
I'll do hard manual labor.

56
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,189
I'll even plow fields,
a whole acre, no, two!

57
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,191
I promise!

58
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:18,663
Let me wake up
from this nightmare!

59
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,166
( Gasping )

60
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,539
( Victim groaning )

61
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,212
Zenitsu: The heck is that?

62
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,549
Are those humans
who got turned into spiders?

63
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,884
Is that house floating?

64
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,155
I can't quite make it out,
but are those threads?

65
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,490
And it really stinks!

66
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,225
Talk about pungent!

67
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,561
Tanjiro would hate this
for sure!

68
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,830
The smell
is making my throat hurt!

69
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:56,234
Not just that.
It's irritating my eyes, too,

70
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,369
( wood creaking )

71
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,704
( Zenitsu shrieks )

72
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,513
( Brother growls )

73
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,315
Zenitsu: It's huge!

74
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,384
Look at the size of that thing!

75
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,587
It's absolutely gigantic!

76
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,125
( Brother laughs )

77
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,127
( Zenitsu whimpering )

78
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,463
You better
not start talking to me!

79
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,131
I don't wanna hear it from you!

80
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,068
( Groans )

81
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,336
( Brother laughs )

82
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,605
There's no point
in running away!

83
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,474
You've already lost the battle!

84
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,609
Zenitsu: I told you
not to talk to me!

85
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,744
I don't wanna hear it,
so stop talking!

86
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,814
Things like you
give me the creeps, all right?

87
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,348
Brother: So you already know

88
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,818
how dire
the situation is for you.

89
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,285
Zenitsu: What are
you talking about?

90
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,287
Brother: Hah!
Take a look at your hands.

91
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,489
Zenitsu: My hands? Why?

92
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,224
( Brother laughs )

93
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,558
Zenitsu:
What's wrong with my ha--

94
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,494
( gasps )

95
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,896
What's this?

96
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,631
Brother: You're poisoned.

97
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,167
A spider bit you, didn't it?

98
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,569
You're gonna
turn into one before long.

99
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,705
( Laughs )

100
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,240
( Zenitsu whimpering )

101
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,442
Brother: In half an hour,
you'll be my slave,

102
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,178
crawling all over the ground!

103
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,180
( Laughs )

104
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,781
Do you understand?

105
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,184
Here. I'll use
this watch to explain.

106
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,586
By the time this long hand
goes around once,

107
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,589
you'll have become
one of the spiders.

108
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,791
- When the hand arrives here...
- ( Watch ticking )

109
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,662
You'll feel tingling
and pain in your limbs.

110
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:34,199
When it's here,
you'll feel dizzy and nauseous.

111
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,801
Here, your body
will painfully start to shrink,

112
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,603
and you'll black out.

113
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:42,207
And by the time you wake up...

114
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,543
( Laughs )

115
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,212
( Women vocalizing )

116
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,614
( Laughs )

117
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,250
( Zenitsu groans )

118
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,486
( Watch ticking )

119
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,190
( Zenitsu groans )

120
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:02,160
( Screams )

121
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,562
Huh?

122
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,163
( Creatures grunting )

123
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,999
( Zenitsu screaming )

124
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,369
( Brother laughs )

125
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,705
- Running away--
- Zenitsu: Is useless! I know!

126
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,508
But you're crazy if you think
I'm not gonna try and get away!

127
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,310
( Grunting )

128
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,711
( Brother laughs )

129
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,313
What do you think you're doing?

130
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,515
Zenitsu: Shut up! Shut up!
Just you shut up!

131
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,118
Brother: There's no need
to be afraid.

132
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,453
Once the transformation
has taken effect,

133
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,323
- you'll lose your humanity.
- Zenitsu: Exactly!

134
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,392
That's just what I've
been dreading about all this!

135
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,527
Why can't you get that
through your head, huh?!

136
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,196
Someone like you wouldn't have
anyone special in their lives!

137
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,733
( Brother growls ) Maybe
some more poison would help

138
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,201
so we can speed up
the process for you.

139
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,603
( Zenitsu wails )

140
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,204
( Brother chuckles )

141
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,273
( Zenitsu screams )
No, not that!

142
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,608
Stay away from me!

143
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,610
I don't want to turn into
one of those things!

144
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,012
( Whimpers )

145
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:55,280
Man: Get ahold of yourself!

146
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,682
Stop crying and running away!

147
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,752
Doing that isn't going
to get you anywhere!

148
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,754
Come down from there!

149
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,888
You hear me, Zenitsu?

150
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,357
We're going
to continue training!

151
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,092
Zenitsu: If I go through
another one

152
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,761
of your training regimens,
I'm gonna die!

153
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,563
I'm not gonna
be able to handle it!

154
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,365
Man: You're not going to die,

155
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,499
not from this!

156
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,635
Come down from there, you fool!

157
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,036
Zenitsu: Come on, gramps!

158
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,772
Grandfather:
Address me as "master"!

159
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,374
Zenitsu: But I wanna call
you gramps, 'cause I love you!

160
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,310
( Grandfather groaning )

161
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,180
Zenitsu: When the girl I loved
made me raise money

162
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,315
so she could run off
with another guy,

163
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,584
you rescued me
from my mountain of debt!

164
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,254
Maybe all you wanted was
to be able to train a swordsman,

165
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,457
but I want to live up
to your expectations, too!

166
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,059
I don't know that I can, though.

167
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,728
I feel terrible about the fact
that I'm like this.

168
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,198
I really do! Just so you know,

169
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,468
I've been skipping out on sleep
so that I can train more,

170
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,270
but I have absolutely
nothing to show for it!

171
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,474
Why?! Seriously, is there
some reason I don't know about?!

172
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,676
Grandfather:
Calm yourself, Zenitsu!

173
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,544
- The potential lies within you!
- ( Thunder rumbling )

174
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,347
Zenitsu:
I've had enough of it all!

175
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,119
Grandfather: Zenitsu,
are you okay?!

176
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,155
Zenitsu: Getting hit
by lighting...

177
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,692
How unlucky can you get?

178
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,762
That's when
my hair color changed.

179
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:22,434
I was thankful just to be alive,
but even so...

180
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:30,308
I-I hate myself
more than anyone else.

181
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,777
I always try
to get my act together,

182
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,314
but I just end up running away
or cowering in fear.

183
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,184
I'm pathetic.

184
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,255
I want to change. I want
to be a capable individual.

185
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,657
The fact is...

186
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,527
I'm doing absolutely
everything that I can!

187
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,195
But I still
have to be turned into

188
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,064
some horrific spider creature?!

189
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,533
It can't be! Say it isn't true!

190
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,268
( Sobbing )

191
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,670
Brother: What's up
with this guy?

192
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,505
He's a strange one.

193
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:01,273
¶

194
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,607
( Zenitsu whimpers )

195
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,210
Oh, crap! Don't climb up here!

196
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,412
Can't you leave me alone
for just a little bit?!

197
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,516
This is all too much
for me to handle right now!

198
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,221
Eh? Huh?

199
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,092
My hair's falling out already?

200
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,427
Wait. My hair.

201
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,430
Hey, he never mentioned
that part to me!

202
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,831
( Whimpers )

203
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:27,832
( Brother chuckles )

204
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,336
( Zenitsu groans )

205
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,839
Brother: Huh?

206
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,243
I don't understand
this guy at all.

207
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,713
Isn't he a Demon slayer who
came here to kill our family?

208
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,582
But he fainted.

209
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,584
How spineless can you get?

210
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,522
He's gonna fall on his head
and die.

211
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,291
What the hell?

212
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,265
( Zenitsu exhales )

213
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,069
Thunder breathing technique.
First form...

214
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:09,675
Brother: Huh?

215
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:13,979
Poison sputum!

216
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,650
( Sputum sizzles )

217
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,688
Did he just
twist his body in midair?

218
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:27,593
With such quick reflexes,
I hardly recognize him.

219
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:29,561
¶

220
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,564
thunder breathing. First form...

221
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,667
Brother: Hey, you guys,
go take him down!

222
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,706
Zenitsu: Thunder breathing,
first form...

223
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,509
( Brother grunts )

224
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,248
He's been going into
that same stance over and over.

225
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,850
( Chuckles )

226
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,719
Ah, I know why he's doing that.

227
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:59,425
He must only be capable
of that one attack.

228
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:03,461
Grandfather:
Don't worry about it, Zenitsu.

229
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,197
That's good enough progress.

230
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:10,134
Mastering even one
is cause for celebration.

231
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,205
If you can only do one thing,
hone it to perfection.

232
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,446
Work on refining it
to its utmost potential.

233
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:25,283
Zenitsu: But, gramps,
just a little while ago,

234
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,019
you were really angry,

235
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,754
because thunder breathing
has six forms,

236
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,257
and all I can manage to do
is one.

237
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,227
Grandfather:
Do you know what the process

238
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,595
of forging a sword is?

239
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,765
Zenitsu: I don't know.

240
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,567
I wish he'd stop hitting me.

241
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,569
I'm gonna cry.

242
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,705
Grandfather:
When making a sword,

243
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:49,241
you hammer and hammer
to get rid of impurities

244
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,776
and anything else
you don't need.

245
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,046
The greater
the purity of the blade,

246
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,648
the more durable it becomes.

247
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,117
Zenitsu: Is that
why you keep clobbering me

248
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:00,619
day in and day out?

249
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,123
But I'm not made of steel.

250
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,658
I'm living flesh.

251
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,127
( Brother chuckles )

252
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,329
You're not much
of a threat, are you?

253
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,465
And you call yourself
a Demon slayer?

254
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
Any minute now,

255
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,070
you'll be rendered immobile
by that poison.

256
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:21,473
Grandfather:
Zenitsu, perfect it!

257
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:25,077
It's all right to cry
or go off by yourself.

258
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:28,613
Just don't ever give up.

259
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,216
Believe in yourself.

260
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:34,219
You endured
all that hellish training.

261
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:37,089
You'll be rewarded for that
without question.

262
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,824
Work to forge yourself
like a tempered blade

263
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,728
and become
the most resilient of all!

264
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,365
Focus on what you do best!

265
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,634
¶

266
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,307
Man: Get out of here.

267
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,608
Zenitsu: Huh?

268
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,381
Man: You gonna
make me repeat myself?

269
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,615
Leave my sight.

270
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,785
You know why.

271
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,654
The way you cry
like a baby all day long,

272
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,590
aren't you ashamed of yourself?

273
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,792
( Zenitsu sighs )

274
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,060
( Man scoffs ) Good for nothing.

275
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,464
Any effort spent on you
is an absolute waste of time.

276
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,135
Our teacher
is an extraordinary man.

277
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,803
Zenitsu:
But gramps told me that--

278
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,805
- ( gasps )
- Man: Hey, you,

279
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,407
don't go being all familiar
and calling him "gramps"!

280
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,544
He's a former hashira,
someone who earned

281
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,047
the highest title
in the Demon slayer corps!

282
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,417
Hardly anyone
ever gets the chance

283
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,352
to be trained
by a former hashira.

284
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,688
The time he spends training you
is all for nothing.

285
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,157
It's infuriating to see!

286
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,559
I hate even looking at you,
so get out!

287
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,428
Why are you even here?

288
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:52,598
Why do you insist on clinging on
like a patch of mold?!

289
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,433
¶

290
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,709
Zenitsu: I have no parents,

291
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,312
no one who has hopes for me,

292
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:11,115
no one with dreams
that eventually, one day,

293
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,585
I'll be able to accomplish
something important...

294
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,522
Not even a thing as simple

295
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,457
as proving myself
useful to someone,

296
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,394
either by protecting them
or making them happy,

297
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,196
just once in my life.

298
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,166
I have no one like that.

299
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,269
If you mess up or cry
or run away even once,

300
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:35,040
everyone says, "oh, this guy's
no good," and walk away.

301
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,277
Or so I thought.

302
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,679
( Gagging )

303
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,681
( Grandfather grunting )

304
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,416
Zenitsu: Time and time again,

305
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,418
gramps would run me
through my paces.

306
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,423
I tried running away
on numerous occasions.

307
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,160
- But each time I did...
- ( Yelps )

308
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,163
He'd drag me right back.

309
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,165
( Grandfather chuckles )

310
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,635
Zenitsu: He smacked me around
a little too much for my liking,

311
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,505
but he never abandoned me.

312
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,441
Brother: Get him!

313
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,276
Inject more poison
into his veins!

314
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:16,648
( Zenitsu gags )

315
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,650

( Brother laughs )

317
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,258
That should do it.

318
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,227
( Energy crackles )

319
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,730
Brother: Eh?

320
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:33,598
What's this?

321
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,467
The air is vibrating.

322
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,668
( Zenitsu grunts )

323
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,203
( Brother gasps )

324
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:41,740
Zenitsu: Thunder breathing.
First form,

325
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,209
thunderclap and flash!

326
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,343
( Brother gasps )

327
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,746
Zenitsu: Sixfold!

328
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:49,081
( Brother grunts )

329
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,120
( Gasps ) He vanished?

330
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,989

331
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,428

( Gagging )

333
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,509
Did I get slashed? Me?

334
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,444
It can't be!

335
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:23,582
To think, by someone like him.

336
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,655
( Groans )

337
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,524
This is ridiculous!

338
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,728
I was defeated by someone who
could hardly move their limbs!

339
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,596
( Groans )

340
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,565
( Ticking )

( Zenitsu coughs )

342
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,206
I just wanna dream

343
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:52,010
a happy, peaceful dream.

344
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:56,080
In it, I'm more powerful
than anyone.

345
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,549
I'm able to help the weak,

346
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,486
anyone in trouble anytime...

347
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,689
And everything
that gramps taught me,

348
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,492
all the time and
effort he spent,

349
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,294
it wasn't for nothing.

350
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:12,631
In this dream, thanks to gramps,

351
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:16,368
I became strong and was able
to help a lot of people.

352
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,706
But the time for dreams
is over now.

( Chuntaro chirps )

357
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,653
Zenitsu: I'm so sorry.

358
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:35,854
( Chuntaro chirps )

359
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:36,722
( Squeals )

360
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:45,130
( Zenitsu sighs )

361
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,598
Grandfather:
Don't ever give up!

362
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:52,070
¶

363
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:55,207
( Zenitsu inhales )

364
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,741
¶

365
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,478
"don't ever give up."

366
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:01,279
I can use
the breathing technique

367
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,348
to slow down the poison.

368
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,018
Even if it's painful,

369
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,152
even if it's agonizing,

370
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,490
don't try to take
the easy way out,

371
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:14,026
or gramps will let you have it.

372
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,063
Yeah, and Tanjiro's
gonna yell at you, too.

373
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,233
( Thunder crashes )

374
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,635
Tanjiro: What was that sound?

375
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,170
Did lightning just strike?

376
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,505
Inosuke: How should I know?

377
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,708
Tanjiro: Well, I'm not
smelling any thunderclouds,

378
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:31,309
but that odor got stronger

379
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,778
and is messing
with my senses again.

380
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,313
Inosuke!

381
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,715
Inosuke: What? ( Grunts )

382
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:40,318
Tanjiro: I think I'm gonna
go take that path instead.

383
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,255
Inosuke: Why are you telling me?
Do whatever you want!

384
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,124
Tanjiro: So are you
headed back down?

385
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,260
Inosuke: Back down?

386
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,195
Tanjiro:
Down the mountain, I mean.

387
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,597
Inosuke: Why would I do that?
Just beat it!

388
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,067
Tanjiro: What about
all your wounds, though?

389
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,468
Inosuke: What are you
talking about?!

390
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,802
I'm not hurt at all!

391
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,804
( Bell clangs )

392
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,473
Tanjiro: What?

393
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,542
You've gotta be kidding,
Inosuke.

394
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,078
Anyone from a mile away
could see how bloodied you are.

395
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,079
( Footsteps approaching )

396
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,080
- Eh?
- Inosuke: Huh?

397
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,082
¶

398
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,416
( Demon gasps )

399
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,151
Tanjiro: A Demon!

400
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,153
The scent hanging
over this mountain

401
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,289
blocked me from picking that up!

402
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,957
( Inosuke roars )

403
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,959
Listen up, you damn Demon!

404
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,762
I'm gonna tear you to shreds!

405
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,364
Get back here!

406
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:26,332
Tanjiro: Hang on!

407
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,434
Demon: Now, father!

408
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,636
Inosuke:
Who are you callin' "father"?

409
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,305
( Gasps )

410
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,373
Tanjiro: Inosuke!

411
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,575
( Father growls )

412
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,316
( Roars )

413
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,451
( Both gasp )

414
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:49,254
Father: Don't you
come near my family!

415
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:52,057
Stay away from them!

416
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,729
Sister: I'm leaving
the rest to you...

417
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:57,730
Father.

418
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,532
( Inosuke groans )

419
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,134
( Father growls )

420
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,603
Tanjiro: Water breathing.
Second form,

421
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,438
water wheel!

422
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,176
( Yelling )

423
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,216
¶

424
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,155
( Singing in Japanese )
