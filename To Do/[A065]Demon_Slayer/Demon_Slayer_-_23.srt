What's the matter? Go on.

you're being too rough.

19

Ease up a bit, will you?

20
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:31,790
Iguro: I'm only doing this
because he's trying to escape.

21
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:37,362
Shinobu: Tanjiro, if you use
any breathing techniques

22
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:41,033
while your lungs are squeezed,
it'll force your veins to burst.

23

Uzui: His veins will burst?!

24
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,170
I like it! Sounds dramatic!

Nezuko: Humans are
to be protected and saved.

51
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,214
Never hurt them.

52
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,983

stabbing her three times

bloody arm in front of her face,

62

from biting him.

65
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:25,464
undeniable proof
that Nezuko won't attack humans.

think you're doing, Tomioka?

Ubuyashiki: Tanjiro...

69
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,010
I'm sure that, even after this,

70
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,079
there are some
who can not accept Nezuko.

71
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,483
Work towards
changing their minds.

72
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,019
Prove to them
that you and Nezuko

73
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:51,156
can be helpful to our cause
by fighting as demon slayers.

It's like I'm floating.

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,234
His voice...

78
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,804
Is it because of this man's
voice that my body feels light?

79
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,308
Ubuyashiki: Go out
and defeat a twelve kizuki.

80
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:13,712
Do that, and you
will be accepted by all.

81
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,648

more weight as a result.

Ubuyashiki: That is
a bit ambitious for you two.

90
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,873
Let's start by defeating
a twelve kizuki first.

91
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,074

92
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,408

- Keep it together.
- ( Shinobu laughing )

96
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,082

without saying that the Hashira

97
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,016
of the Demon Slayer Corps
have phenomenal skills.

98
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,818
( Hashira chuckling )

99
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,220
Ubuyashiki:
They have trained themselves

100
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,423
to the brink of death
and have defeated it,

101
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,093
as well as those
of the twelve kizuki.

102
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,428
Rengoku: Yes! A noble pursuit!

103
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,298
Ubuyashiki: That is why
the Hashira receive respect

104
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,368
and favorable treatment,
so it would be best for you

105
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,437
to mind your manners
when addressing them, Tanjiro.

106
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,340

Ubuyashiki: Also,
Sanemi, Obanai,

108
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,782
don't torment
the younger ones too much.

109

our business with you, Tanjiro.

113
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,795
You may step back.

114
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,865
Shinobu: If that's
the case, master,

115
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,268
allow me to take Tanjiro
into my abode.

116
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,205
Tanjiro: Huh?

117
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,074
Shinobu: All right, then!

118
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,275

begin the Hashira meeting.

if you would!

that man covered in scars!

130
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,377
I need to do it!

131
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,245
Kakushi 2: Quiet!
Keep your mouth shut!

132
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,048
Tanjiro: One head-butt for
every time he stabbed Nezuko!

133
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,984
Show me where it says
you're not allowed

134
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,786
to head-butt
another Demon Slayer!

135
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,054

Settle down now!

to interrupt the master,

all right?

Did I just hear him
mention miss Tamayo?

153
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,036
Kakushi 1: Don't you
say another word!

154
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,038
We got scolded because of you!

Kakushi 2: I thought
I was gonna wet myself!

156

Kakushi 1: You don't know
how terrifying the Hashira are!

157

next time!

I will never forgive you!

Anyone home?

Is there anyone here?

Is there any--( Groans )

coming to the door, huh?

check out the yard.

Hey, walk on your own two feet.

Tanjiro: Mm, sorry.

172
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:11,450
It's just my whole body's
aching up a storm.

173
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:16,755
And I thought
the headquarters were big,

174
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:20,392
but this mansion's
in a league of its own, huh?

175
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,094
Eh?

176
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,896
That's right.

177
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,765
Wasn't this place called
the butterfly mansion?

Kakushi 2:
Well, would you look at that?

180
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,975
There is someone here.

181
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,579
Kakushi 1:
That would be, um...

182
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,448
Oh, right! The Tsuguko.

183
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,584
I believe her name is...

184
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,851
Tanjiro: A "Tsuguko"?

185
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:50,054
Kakushi 2: Lady Kanao Tsuyuri.

186
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,390
( Tanjiro gasps )

187
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,058
¶

188
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,731
it's that girl
from final selection.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
Kakushi 2: From what I was told,

190
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,602
she stomped you real good
last night.

191
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,770
You don't remember that?

192
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,742
A Tsuguko is a Swordsman
trained by a Hashira.

193
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,945
Only those with impressive skill
are chosen.

194
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,749
Don't let her
being a girl fool you.

195
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,686
Kakushi 1: Please forgive us,
lady Tsuyuri.

196
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,623
We were ordered to come here
by lady Kocho.

197
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,559
Permission to enter
the mansion, ma'am.

198
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,001
Uh, if that's all right?

199
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:43,642
You don't mind, do you?

200
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,844
- Woman: Who are all of you?!
- ( Kakushi shriek )

201
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,712
Kakushi 2:
We're here on behalf of...

202
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:48,781
Kakushi 1: Lady Kocho!

203
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,516
Woman: That boy
is injured, correct?

204
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,117
You're the Kakushi.

205
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,720
Please come this way.

206
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,522
Kakushi 1: Y-yes, ma'am!

207
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,757
Kakushi 2: She's fast.

208
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,595
( Tanjiro sighs )

209
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,400
Zenitsu: Five times?!

210
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,803
I gotta take this
five times a day?!

211
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,672
And I have to keep taking it
for three months?!

212
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:16,141
It's such
a horribly bitter taste, too!

213
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,677
I'm not gonna want
to eat a single thing

214
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,412
after taking that!

215
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,414
You're telling me
that my arms and legs

216
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,017
will be restored just by taking
this medicine?! Really?!

217
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,085
Girl: Would you
please stop shouting?

218
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,953
Zenitsu: Explain to me
how that's gonna work!

219
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,023
I don't understand at all!

220
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,091
Woman: Still making a fuss,
even now?

221
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:36,161
Zenitsu: ...Forget even
just one time?! Huh?! Huh?!

222
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,030
What'll happen
to my arms and legs?!

223
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,832
- Tanjiro: Zenitsu!
- Zenitsu: Tell me! Tell me!

224
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,500
Woman: Please lower your voice!

225
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:42,835
Zenitsu: Please! Please!

226
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,770
Woman: How many times
have we explained it to you now?

227
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,640
If you don't stop this,
we'll have to restrain you!

228
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,775
( Zenitsu babbling )

229
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,778
Woman: Oh, for goodness's sake!

230
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,714
Tanjiro: Zenitsu.

231
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,715
( Zenitsu shrieks )

232
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,050
Tanjiro: What happened?

233
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,718
Are you all right?

234
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,854
So you came up the mountain
after all.

235
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:06,458
Zenitsu: T-Tanjiro.

236
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,726
( Wails )

237
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:09,594
- It was terrible, Tanjiro...
- Kakushi 2: Uh...

238
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,063
Zenitsu: Just awful!

239
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:15,534
I got bit by this icky spider,
and it really hurt!

240
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,802
( Sniffs ) That girl's
been yelling at me

241
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,472
ever since I arrived
at this place also!

242
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,807
- I hate my life!
- Kakushi 2: Hey,
stop crying on me.

243
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,543
I've got nothing
to do with this.

244
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:26,945
Tanjiro: Zenitsu, did you...

245
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,881
Get smaller or something?

246
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,550
( Zenitsu gurgles)

247
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:34,018
I almost
got turned into a spider,

248
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,955
so my arms and legs
are really short right now.

249
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,690
Tanjiro:
So that's what happened.

250
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,094
And the others?
Where are Inosuke and murata?

251
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,630
Zenitsu: I don't know
about anyone named murata,

252
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,100
but Inosuke's right over there.

253
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,035
- Tanjiro: Oh, you're right!
- ( Singers vocalizing )

254
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,571
He's been here all this time,

255
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,972
and I didn't notice!

256
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:54,973
( Kakushi 2 groans )

257
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,642
( Tanjiro grunts )

258
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,279
Inosuke! I'm glad you're safe.

259
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,716
I'm so relieved. ( Gasps )

260
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,820
Sorry I couldn't rescue you.

261
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:12,457
( Inosuke hoarse ) It's okay.

262
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,192
Don't worry about it.

263
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,860
Kakushi 2: Help! I need
a handkerchief or something!

264
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,529
- Tanjiro: Your voice.
- Kakushi 2: Ugh!

265
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,531
- Tanjiro: Is that really you?
- Kakushi 2: Get it off! Hey!

266
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,066
Is anybody listening to me?!

267
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,668
Zenitsu: I heard he mangled
his throat or something.

268
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,203
Tanjiro: Huh?

269
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,871
Zenitsu: I don't know
all the details,

270
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,341
but I heard
he got hit in the neck,

271
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,677
and when he yelled at the top
of his lungs sometime after,

272
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,546
that's what pushed him
over the edge.

273
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,681
It really messed him up,
as you can hear.

274
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,084
The whole thing has taken
the wind out of his sails

275
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,685
and made him really passive.

276
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,155
You know, it's kind of funny.
( Titters )

277
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,889
( Crazed laughter )

278
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,560
Tanjiro: Why are you cackling
all weird like that suddenly?

279
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,429
What's going on?

280
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:51,797
Zenitsu: Eh?

281
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,633
Inosuke: I'm sorry...

282
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,735
For being so weak.

283
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,905
- ( Tanjiro sighs )
- Kakushi 2: Eww.

284
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,041
Tanjiro: Don't be sad, Inosuke.

285
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,977
This isn't like you at all.

286
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,845
Zenitsu: Yeah,
there's nothing to worry about!

287
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,513
You did great!

288
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,716
Tanjiro: I'm just so happy
that you're all right!

289
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,385
( Zenitsu shrieks ) Wait!

290
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,787
Did I take
my morning medicine?!

291
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,388
Did you see me take it?!

292
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,856
Did anybody see me take it?!

293
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:19,491
Anyone?!

294
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,561
( Inosuke snoring )

295
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,606
Tanjiro: Zenitsu, Inosuke...

296
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,977
You're alive. I'm so glad.

297
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,881
( Footsteps shuffling )

298
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,629
( Curtains rustling )

299
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,835
It's all right now.

300
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,637
They said it was fine for you
to use this room, Nezuko.

301
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,943
( Groans ) Ouch, ouch, ouch.

302
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:18,650
That whole encounter up on
the mountain was really brutal.

303
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,452
I gotta be honest.

304
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,655
Everything hurts right now.

305
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,723
( Nezuko sighs )

306
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:26,725
Tanjiro: Nezuko...

307
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:29,327
What you did,
protecting me on the mountain,

308
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,295
thank you.

309
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,733
There are the others, too,

310
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:38,537
Tomioka, Urokodaki.

311
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:42,474
They've all gone out and risked
their lives on our behalf.

312
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,577
It's really something, huh?

313
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,383
I-I have to become stronger.

314
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,088
Take today.

315
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:59,291
If it weren't
for the Hashira's master,

316
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:00,993
we may not have been spared.

317
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:03,495
( No audible dialogue )

318
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,030
Tanjiro: That man's voice...

319
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,033
It was mysteriously soothing.

320
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,738
Just listening to him speak
made my body feel light.

321
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,475
Who is he, exactly?

322
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:22,781
( Gasps )

323
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,750
( Nezuko breathing softly )

324
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,456
Tanjiro: That makes sense.

325
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,727
You've had a long day.

326
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,197
Even though
I'm in a lot of pain right now,

327
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,733
I have to keep pushing forward.

328
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:45,870
That's because
I'll be a grown man one day,

329
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,508
and then I'll become old
and pass on.

330
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,877
After that,

331
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,281
if you're still a demon,
then you'll be lonely.

332
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:01,286
That would be far too lonely,
wouldn't it?

333
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:03,888
( Nezuko breathing softly )

334
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,024
Tanjiro: I promise...

335
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,894
I will turn you
back into a human.

336
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,431
¶

337
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,834
( singers vocalizing )

338
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,970
Ubuyashiki: Just as
you all have reported,

339
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:21,906
the carnage of the demons
has grown more than ever,

340
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,708
meaning the threat to human life

341
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,045
in turn is greater
than it has ever been.

342
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:30,382
We must bolster the ranks
of the demon slayers.

343
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,584
What, then, are your thoughts?

344
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,921
Shinazugawa: The incident
on mount natagumo says it all.

345
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,459
The caliber of demon slayers
has dropped tremendously.

346
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:43,127
Most of them are useless.

347
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,998
The trainers must have
gone blind or something.

348
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,000
You'd think
they could at least tell

349
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:51,069
if someone's competent or not.

350
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,339
Uzui: Well, that kid today
sure packed a lot of power.

351
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:56,809
He landed
that dazzling blow on you.

352
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,544
He's got potential.

353
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,813
( Shinazugawa scoffs )

354
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,147
Shinobu: The more
the human race grows,

355
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,819
the harder it becomes
to control and unify them,

356
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:11,356
and in this era, that seems
to be even more true.

357
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,558
Gyomei: There are those
who've joined us

358
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,694
after their loved ones
were slaughtered,

359
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,496
and there are those
of noted pedigree

360
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,832
who have hunted demons
for generations,

361
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,567
but for everyone else,
it's another matter.

362
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,770
Asking laymen for the same
or even greater commitment

363
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:28,306
to our cause, I feel,
would be much too cruel.

364
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,509
Rengoku:
But consider that this boy

365
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:34,179
soon after joining
encountered a twelve kizuki.

366
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,448
I think he can draw them out!

367
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,584
Even we rarely
get the chance to confront one!

368
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:40,586
I am envious!

369
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:44,189
Ubuyashiki: A fair point.

370
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,526
However, the fact
that lower-five demon

371
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,661
made such a drastic move

372
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,298
likely means Kibutsuji
is far from mount natagumo.

373
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,535
Like with asakusa,

374
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,871
whenever he wishes
to hide something,

375
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,273
he proceeds to create
a clever diversion

376
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,475
to throw us off his trail.

377
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,545
To be honest,
it's quite frustrating.

378
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:13,017
But as long as those demons
linger as they do now,

379
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:17,690
freely devouring humans and
gaining strength as a result,

380
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,958
there is only one thing
for us to do

381
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:22,361
for the sake
of those who have died.

382
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:24,829
I feel...

383
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,832
You who are present today,
the core Hashira,

384
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,768
are the finest unit
I have assembled

385
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:33,572
since the first breathing
swordsmen of the feudal era.

386
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,974
Tengen Uzui.

387
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,577
Kyojuro Rengoku.

388
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,779
Shinobu Kocho.

389
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,781
Mitsuri Kanroji.

390
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:45,384
Muichiro Tokito.

391
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,786
Gyomei Himejima.

392
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,988
Sanemi Shinazugawa.

393
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:52,190
Iguro Obanai.

394
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,059
Giyu Tomioka.

395
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:58,663
My beloved children...

396
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,866
I look forward
to seeing your success.

397
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,370
¶

398
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:13,612
Muzan Kibutsuji,

399
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,814
I swear that I shall defeat you.

400
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:20,619
We will bring you down
without fail.

401
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:23,155
¶

402
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,057
