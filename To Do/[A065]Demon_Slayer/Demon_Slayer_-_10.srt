The whirlpool isn't as strong
when it's not underwater,

21
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,666

power and envelop the arrows.

How could you do this to me?!

25
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,240
I just needed
to bring him your head.

26
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,109
That's all it would have taken
to finally win his approval!

27

for what you've done to me!

you shoving it into the dirt!

This force is stronger

34

35
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,332

so many moves in a row before.

Avoiding a bunch
of linear attacks like these

88

You think you're tough,

to kick my temari back at me?

Lady tamayo,
what did you do to her?

115
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,923
Tamayo: I just gave her
a healing serum

116
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:35,127
made specifically for demons,
but all it did was heal her.

117
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,932
It has no effect
on her physical strength.

118
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,467
We're witnessing nezuko's power.

119

is formidable.

If she gave it her all,
nezuko wouldn't stand a chance.

126
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,562
She needs help.

127

Aren't you
an amusing little girl?

130

Get out of the way.

Move it, you damn fugitive.

138
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:37,589
Tamayo: One question,
that's all I'm asking.

139
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:41,193
Do you have any idea
who kibutsuji really is?

140

141
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,996
What the hell are you saying?!

142

Tamayo: He's a coward.

143
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,400
Surely you've realized that.

144
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,003
He's in a constant
state of fear.

145
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,471
Susamaru: How dare you?

146
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,339
Damn you! Shut up!

147
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,674
Tamayo: Do you want to know

148
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,211
why no demons
can ever group together

149
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,580
or why they cannibalize
each other?

150
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,083
Because he doesn't
want us to group up.

151
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:08,553
His fear is that we
would attack him if we could.

152
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,357
He manipulates demons
to make them behave,

153
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,092
demons like you.

154
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,428

Don't say that! Shut up!

156
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,298

to be so petty!

of daylight.

It weakens

making it impossible
for them to lie or keep secrets.

( Susamaru weeping )

185
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,843
( Tanjiro gasps )

186
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,912
( Squelching, cracking )

187
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,318
( Squelching,
cracking continue )

188
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,494
¶

189
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:43,408
Tanjiro: Is it all over?
Is she dead?

190
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,911
Tamayo: She will be momentarily.

191
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,415
Kibutsuji's curse.

192
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,484
The cells he left in her body
will destroy it.

193
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,453
She'll be ripped apart
from the inside.

194
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:02,160
Generally speaking, a battle
between demons is futile.

195
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:04,162
It's pointless.

196
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,966
The wounds they inflict
on each other can't be fatal.

197
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,137
Only sunlight or the sword
of a demon slayer can kill them.

198
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,108
Except kibutsuji.

199
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,112
He's the only one
who can destroy a demon's cells.

200
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,113
( Tanjiro sighs )

201
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,514
( Running footsteps )

202
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,250
( Gasps )

203
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,053
Yushiro: You can't inhale
lady tamayo's spell.

204
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,988
The human body can't take it.

205
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,389
You got that?

206
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,390
( Tanjiro grunts )

207
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,992
Tamayo: Tanjiro...

208
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,128
The demon we fought,

209
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:39,197
she's not
one of the twelve kizuki.

210
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,933
The twelve kizuki
all have numbers

211
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:46,404
engraved on their eyeballs,
but she doesn't have one,

212
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:51,076
which means that the other demon
most likely doesn't, either.

213
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,878
They were too weak.

214
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,482
Tanjiro: Hmm? Too weak? Really?!

215
00:11:56,616 --> 00:12:00,152
Yushiro: Don't question her.
Lady tamayo's never wrong.

216
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:04,222
Pathetic. That demon
was incredibly stupid.

217
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,159
She thought she could get away
with hurting lady tamayo.

218
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,895
She deserved
what happened to her.

219
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,967
Tamayo: With any luck,
this blood will still

220
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:19,204
be instrumental for us
in developing a cure.

221
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:24,176
Now I need
to take care of nezuko.

222
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:28,580
She was already medicated,
and she inhaled my spell,

223
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,183
for which I'm deeply sorry.

224
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,317
( Yushiro gasps )

225
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,319
All right, don't move a muscle!

226
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,587
You're on your own now.

227
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,123
I won't leave
lady tamayo's side,

228
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,024
not for a second!

229
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,399
( Susamaru gasping )

230
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,201
Mari.

231
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,235
Tanjiro: Hmm?

232
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,471
Susamaru: Mari.

233
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,341
Mari.

234
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,746
( Singers vocalizing )

235
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,484
( Temari rings )

236
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,488
Tanjiro: Here's your temari.

237
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,758
Susamaru: Play with me.

238
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,295
Play with me.

239
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,567
Tanjiro: You probably
murdered dozens,

240
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,803
but, inside,
you're just a little kid.

241
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,210
( Birds chirping )

242
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:46,124
You thought you were
one of the twelve kizuki,

243
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:49,261
deceived, forced to fight,

244
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:53,365
and now it's kibutsuji's curse
that killed you.

245
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,468
No salvation.

246
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,440
Once you die,
not even your bones remain.

247
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,247
Is this the price you pay
for killing people?

248
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,186
( Crying )

249
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:21,159
Kibutsuji.

250
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,430
Even the people who follow him
get treated this way.

251
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,300
He truly is a demon.

252
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,017
Miss tamayo!

253
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,386
Hey, yushiro?

254
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,456
Yushiro: We're over here.

255
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,357
Tanjiro: Wha...

256
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,461
Yushiro: You really
don't need to come down,

257
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,329
but if you want to,
hurry it up.

258
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:58,864
Tamayo: Yushiro!

259
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,932
Yushiro: Just kidding!

260
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,335
Tamayo: It's all right.
Come on down, tanjiro.

261
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:05,070
Tanjiro: Oh, okay.

262
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,347
( Gasps ) Nezuko!

263
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,416
Tamayo: I thought it best

264
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,486
to get her down to the basement
before daybreak.

265
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,420
The sunlight
won't reach us here.

266
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:23,889
( Nezuko grunts )

267
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:24,957
Tanjiro: Nezuko?

268
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,496
( Yushiro stammers )

269
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,030
What are you doing?!

270
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,032
Step away from lady tamayo!

271
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:34,966
That's so rude!

272
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,369
Calm down, yushiro.

273
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:38,970
I don't mind at all.

274
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,372
Yushiro: Right!

275
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:43,175
You're so kind, lady tamayo,

276
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,910
too beautiful to believe.

277
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,978
( Nezuko grunts )

278
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,446
( Yushiro stammers )

279
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,981
No! Stop!

280
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,583
Yushiro: It's a bit strange.

281
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:54,986
She's been acting like this
ever since she woke up.

282
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,855
I wonder if she's all right.

283
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,390
Tanjiro: There's nothing
to worry about.

284
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,591
She's just fine.

285
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,193
( Yushiro stammering )

286
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,061
Tanjiro: If I were
to make a guess,

287
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:05,597
I'd say she thinks
of you both as family.

288
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,865
Yushiro: Knock it off!

289
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,335
Tamayo: Us as family?

290
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,137
But wait. I thought
the spell nezuko was under

291
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,273
only made her
see humans as family,

292
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,943
and yushiro and I are demons.

293
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,878
Yushiro: I said stop!

294
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,347
Tanjiro: Not to nezuko.

295
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,149
You two are as human
as anyone to her.

296
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,885
She wanted to protect you.

297
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:33,825
You know, I didn't like
the idea of that spell at first,

298
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:36,628
but she still seems to have
a will of her own, so...

299
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,496
¶

300
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,900
( gasps ) I'm so sorry!
Nezuko, stop it!

301
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,301
Get away from her!

302
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,503
You're being very rude!

303
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,905
( Tamayo sniffles )

304
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,241
Thank you.

305
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:52,077
Thank you so much, nezuko.

306
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:07,993
Tamayo: There is a way for me
to keep you alive, if you want.

307
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:12,765
However, it will cost you
your humanity.

308
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,134
If I don't do it,

309
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:19,137
you will indeed succumb
to your illness.

310
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:22,340
But beware.
If you lose your humanity,

311
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,309
that will cause pain as well.

312
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,415
So tell me.
Do you still wish to live?

313
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:38,890
( Yushiro sighs )

314
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,093
Tamayo: Yushiro and I
will be leaving this region.

315
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,494
Yushiro: Huh?

316
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,363
Tamayo: We're too close
to kibutsuji now.

317
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,232
It's far too risky to stay here.

318
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,968
We need a new place to hide.

319
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,771
Besides, I think
I've hidden my identity,

320
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,307
but, after treating
so many humans,

321
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,910
I'm sure some of them
figured out I'm a demon.

322
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:02,380
Children and the elderly
are especially perceptive.

323
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,249
So, tanjiro...

324
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,583
Tanjiro: Yes?

325
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,453
Tamayo: To protect nezuko,

326
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,055
would you like us
to take her with us when we go?

327
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,058
- ( Yushiro gasps )
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

328
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:16,061
Tamayo: Obviously
I can't promise her safety,

329
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,530
but I believe
she'll face less danger

330
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,132
than she will in battle.

331
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,404
Tanjiro: She might be right.

332
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,942
With them, wherever they end up,
nezuko would be safer.

333
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,748
( Gasps )

334

( Grunts )

336
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,228
Miss tamayo,
thank you for your concern,

337
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:53,899
but nezuko's staying with me.

338
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,968
Nothing's gonna break us apart.

339
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:58,436
( Singers vocalizing )

340
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,005
No. Never again.

341
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,776
Tamayo: Yes, I understand.

342
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:07,713
Well, I wish you
good fortune, then.

343
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:09,181
Yushiro: All right.

344
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,650
We will be leaving
as soon as we cover our tracks.

345
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,986
You should get moving as well.

346
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:17,389
Tanjiro: You're right,
and good luck.

347
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,758
Thank you for everything
you've done for us.

348
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:24,062
- Let's go, nezuko.
- ( Nezuko grunts )

349
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:25,597
Tanjiro: Hey!

350
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,533
That doesn't mean
you need to run!

351
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,434
Yushiro: Tanjiro!

352
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,206
Your little sister...

353
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,342
I guess she is a beauty.

354
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,210
( Tanjiro gasps )

South-southeast!

358
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,887
South-southeast!
South-southeast!

359
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,023
The next place you need to go
is south-southeast!

360
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,759
- Tanjiro: I heard you!
