( Wind blowing )

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,291
Boy: How?

6
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,431
How in the world could
something like this happen?

7
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,233
Come on, nezuko!

8
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,036
I've got you! Don't die on me!

9
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,304
( Panting )

10
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,974
No matter what it takes,
I'll save you!

11
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,710
I won't let you die.

12
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,446
I promise I'll save you.

13
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,582
Your big brother's got you!

14
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,451
( Woman vocalizing )

16
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:00,993
( boy grunts )

17
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,396
Woman: Tanjiro.

18
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,868
Your face
is all covered in soot.

19
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,603
Let me clean you up.

20
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,874
You know,
you really don't have to go.

21
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,410
All this snow
could be dangerous.

22
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,079
Tanjiro: I want us to have
a good new year's celebration

23
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,415
where everyone can eat
as much as they want,

24
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,684
so I'll sell
all the charcoal I can.

25
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,586
( Woman sighs ) How thoughtful.

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,623
Boy: Hey, bro!

27
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,693
Are you going
to town again today?

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,162
Girl: I'm coming with you!

29
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,897
Woman: No, you're not.

30
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:42,300
You know you can't walk
as fast as tanjiro can, sweetie.

31
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,303
- Boy: Aw, come on, mom!
- Mother: No way.

32
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:48,173
He's not going to be able
to use the cart today,

33
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,843
which means he can't give you
a ride when you get tired.

34
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,845
( Both groan )

35
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,646
Boy: Tanjiro!

36
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,850
Girl: I wanna come with you.

37
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,853
I promise I'll help out.

38
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,188
Tanjiro: That's very generous
of you, hanako.

39
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,656
- ( Hanako gasps )
- Tanjiro: But no.

40
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,324
You're staying home today.

41
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,659
( Hanako moans )

42
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,461
( Boy moans )

43
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,064
Tanjiro: Sorry, shigeru.
You are, too.

44
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,732
But I'll bring back
goodies, okay?

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,133
Shigeru: Promise?

46
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,602
- Tanjiro: Yeah.
- ( Shigeru laughs )

47
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:19,137
Tanjiro: And, hanako,

48
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,873
I'll read for you
when I get home later.

49
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:21,874
Hanako: 'Kay!

50
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,475
Tanjiro: Good girl.

51
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,544
Mother: Thank you
for doing this, tanjiro.

52
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,879
Tanjiro: 'Course.

53
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,680
Time for me to head out.

54
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,350
Hey, takeo, do me a favor
while I'm gone, okay?

55
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,286
Chop as much wood as you can.

56
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,622
Takeo: Yeah, I was already
gonna do that anyway.

57
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:41,493
But I was kinda hoping we'd do
that together this time. Hmph.

58
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,828
Tanjiro: There, there, now.

59
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,697
Takeo: Knock it off, would you?!

60
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,232
( Shigeru laughs )
You're blushing, take!

61
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,500
Takeo: Shut up, you brat!

62
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,834
Tanjiro: There, there, now.

63
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,370
Takeo: I told you
to cut it out! ( Groans )

64
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,773
( Family laughing )

65
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,578
Shigeru: Come back
as soon as you can, okay?

66
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,613
Hanako: Be safe,
and see you when you get back!

67
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,750
¶

68
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,587
nezuko: Hi, tanjiro.

69
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,322
Tanjiro: Hey, nezuko.

70
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,392
Nezuko: I had to put
rokuta down for a nap now.

71
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,394
Otherwise, he would throw a fit.

72
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:19,098
Ever since dad passed,
he's been glued to your side.

73
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,503
In fact, everyone seems
to follow you wherever you go.

74
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,640
I'll see you when you get back!

75
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:35,547
Tanjiro: We don't exactly have
an easy life, but we're happy.

76
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,416
Life can change, though,

77
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,885
as sudden as the weather.

78
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,455
It shifts and moves on.

79
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,691
The sun can't shine forever,

80
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,629
and the snow has to stop
at some point.

81
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,499
But whatever happens,
when happiness is destroyed,

82
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,637
it's always followed
by the smell of blood.

83
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,541
( Birds chirping )

84
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,311
( Soft overlapping chatter )

85
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,780
( Woman sighs )

86
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,714
Ah, tanjiro!

87
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,717
You came down the mountain
on a day like today?

88
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:16,455
Don't you ever stop working?
You could catch a cold.

89
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,791
Tanjiro: It's not
as bad as you think.

90
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,726
You need a refill on charcoal,
by any chance?

91
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,862
- Man: Hey, tanjiro!
- Tanjiro: Eh?

92
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,864
Man: I'll take some more!

93
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,599
Man 2: I'm good, but thanks

94
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,868
for fixing my sliding doors
the other day.

95
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,936
Woman 2: I need
some charcoal, too!

96
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,071
- ( Rumbling )
- ( Tanjiro chuckles )

97
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,807
( Boy wails )

98
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,676
( Gasps ) Tanjiro!

99
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,478
- ( Woman 3 growls )
- Boy: I'm so glad you're here!

100
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,081
I've been accused
of breaking this plate!

101
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,817
Can you help me out here?

102
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:45,884
Give it a sniff!

103
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,687
( Tanjiro sniffs )

104
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,088
( Gasps )

105
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,557
It smells like a cat to me.

106
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,892
Boy: You see?

107
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,894
Woman 3: So it
really was a cat.

108
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,563
Boy: I tried to tell you
I didn't do it!

109
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,499
Man 3: Hey there, tanjiro!
I don't suppose

110
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,335
you could give me a hand
with this luggage, could you?

111
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,338
( Wind blowing )

112
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,575
Tanjiro: How'd it get so late?

113
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,811
Oh, well. At least I sold out.

114
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:17,449
- Man: Hang on! Tanjiro!
- Tanjiro: Eh?

115
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,452
Man: You're not going
back up the mountain now.

116
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,254
It's simply too dangerous.

117
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,457
Tanjiro: Oh, I'll be fine.
I've got a good nose.

118
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,726
Man: You can stay here
for the night.

119
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,262
Come on. Get inside.

120
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,663
Tanjiro: No, i'm--

121
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,666
man: Don't argue.
Just get in here...

122
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,668
Before the demons show up.

123
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,437
¶

124
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,483
Tanjiro: Thanks for dinner.

125
00:05:55,956 --> 00:06:01,093
Hey, uh, Mr. Saburo,
what did you mean by "demons"?

126
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,828
Saburo: There have always
been man-eating demons

127
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,631
prowling about after dark.

128
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,503
That's why it's not safe
to go outside at night.

129
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,772
Time for bed.

130
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,375
You can set off for home
at first light.

131
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,447
Tanjiro: These demons,

132
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,650
they're not able to come
inside your house, are they?

133
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,720
Saburo: Yes, they could come in.

134
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,955
( Chorus vocalizing )

135
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:35,661
Tanjiro: But, then,
wouldn't they just eat everyone?

136
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,332
Saburo: The demon slayers
protect us

137
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,667
by killing
as many as they can.

138
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,503
They always have.

139
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,872
Now go to sleep.

140
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,375
It's lights out.

141
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,946
Tanjiro: Old man saburo,

142
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,881
he's been on his own
since he lost his family.

143
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,418
He must be lonely.

144
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,686
I'll bring
my brothers and sisters by.

145
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,555
You don't have to be scared.

146
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,025
There are no demons.
You're safe.

147
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,894
Although,
now that I think of it,

148
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:12,097
my grandma used to say
the same thing

149
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,766
before she passed away.

150
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,571
( Birds chirping )

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,573
Saburo: You be careful now.

152
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,608
Tanjiro: Thank you!

153
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,716
( Bird squawks )

154
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,886
Tanjiro: Whenever happiness
is destroyed...

155
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,989
It's always followed...

156
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,592
Eh?

157
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,661
( Sniffs )

158
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,997
The smell of blood.

159
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,965
( Woman vocalizing )

160
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,107
( Panting )

161
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,979
( Gasping )

162
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:08,953
Nezuko!

163
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,290
What happened?!
What's going on here?!

164
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,559
What happened to you?!

165
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,861
( Gasps )

166
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,367
Mom?

167
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,738
( Gasping )

168
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,710
Mom. Hanako.

169
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,113
Takeo. Shigeru.

170
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,983
Nezuko. Rokuta.

171
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,887
- ( Panting )
- ( Footsteps crunching )

172
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,794
Nezuko's the only one
who's still warm.

173
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,997
If I can get her to a doctor,
she might live.

174
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:54,967
How could
something like this happen?

175
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,870
Maybe a bear...

176
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,905
That couldn't find
a place to hibernate?

177
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,946
I can't breathe!

178
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,149
The air is icy! My lungs hurt!

179
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,285
Just keep moving!

180
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,154
Move those legs
of yours faster!

181
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:20,559
We've still got a long way
to go to get to town. Hurry!

182
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,861
I won't let you die.

183
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,499
No matter what it takes,

184
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,768
your big brother will save you!

185
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,772
( Nezuko gurgles )

186
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,173
( Growling )

187
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,875
( Tanjiro gasping )

188
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,578
Oh, no!

189
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:40,713
( Screams )

190
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,749
( Snow crunches )

191
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,652
( Shudders )

192
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,588
The snow saved me...

193
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,726
But the snow is
the only reason I fell.

194
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,495
Nezuko?

195
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,237
Nezuko, are you okay?

196
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,540
You don't have to walk!

197
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,943
Let me carry you
to town, all right?

198
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,677
Nezuko!

199
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,813
( Nezuko growls )

200
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,248
( Snarling )

201
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,089
Sh-she's...

202
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:25,591
A demon!

203
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:31,229
This is what old man saburo
tried to tell me about.

204
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,898
She's a man-eating demon?

205
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,701
Impossible! Nezuko's a human

206
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:38,637
since the day she was born!

207
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,975
Except she doesn't have
nezuko's scent anymore.

208
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,778
But she isn't
the one who killed them.

209
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,781
She was lying on top of rokuta
like she was protecting him,

210
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:52,117
and her hands and mouth
weren't covered in blood,

211
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:55,720
but there was one more.
There was another scent!

212
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,990
- ( Gasps )
- ( Flesh creaking )

213
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:04,062
- How are you getting bigger?!
- ( Nezuko growling )

214
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,865
Tanjiro: And she's
getting stronger, too!

215
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:10,669
While I was sleeping
like a baby at saburo's,

216
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,205
you were all
being brutally murdered!

217
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,273
It must have hurt.

218
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,810
You suffered, didn't you?

219
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,846
I'm sorry
I wasn't there to help.

220
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,484
I have to at least
save nezuko, though!

221
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:29,154
But she's too strong
for me to do anything!

222
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:32,825
Nezuko! Hang on, nezuko!

223
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,728
Don't give in!
You gotta hang on!

224
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,831
Don't let it take control!

225
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,833
You gotta stay strong!

226
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,203
Just hang on! Please!

227
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,339
( Gasps )

228
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,843
( Nezuko weeping )

229
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,081
¶

230
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,322
Eh? ( Gasps )

231
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,157
( Swordsman gasps )

232
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,762
( Wind gusting )

233
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:12,698
( Tanjiro grunts )

234
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,934
( Flesh creaks )

235
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,936
What the...

236
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,072
( Wind blowing )

237
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,606
( Sword clinks )

238
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,208
Who's that?

239
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,645
( Gasps )

240
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:28,747
A sword?

241
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,483
Swordsman: Why are
you protecting it?

242
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:32,885
Tanjiro: She's my sister!

243
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,887
I was taking her to get help!

244
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,489
( Nezuko snarling )

245
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:38,791
Tanjiro: Nezuko!

246
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,363
Swordsman: You call
that thing your sister?

247
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,166
( Nezuko snarling )

248
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,169
( Tanjiro gasps )

249
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,105
( Nezuko growling )

250
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,973
( Tanjiro gasping )

251
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,748
- Nezuko!
- Swordsman: Don't move!

252
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,922
My job is to slay
every demon I find,

253
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,125
which means I have to decapitate
your sister here.

254
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,859
Tanjiro: No, wait!

255
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,195
Nezuko hasn't hurt anyone!

256
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,997
Back at my house,

257
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,334
there was another scent
I'd never smelled before!

258
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:26,605
That's probably the one
who killed my family!

259
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,073
Nezuko didn't do it!

260
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,210
I don't know why she's changed
into something like this,

261
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,412
but still--

262
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,080
swordsman:
It's really quite simple.

263
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:40,085
She's turned because her wounds
were exposed to demon blood.

264
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:44,089
That's how the man-eating
monsters multiply.

265
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,959
Tanjiro: Nezuko would
never eat a human!

266
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,027
Swordsman: You must be joking.

267
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,229
If I hadn't gotten here
when I did,

268
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,965
she would have devoured you.

269
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,300
Tanjiro: You're wrong!
She wouldn't hurt me!

270
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,102
She knows I'm her big brother!

271
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,638
And I won't let her hurt anyone!

272
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,040
I'll turn her back into a human!

273
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,375
I will heal her!

274
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:05,978
Swordsman: She can't be healed.

275
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:09,181
Once you become a demon,
no one can ever turn back.

276
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,582
Tanjiro: There's a way,

277
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:13,318
and I'll find it,
no matter what it takes,

278
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,520
so please let her live!

279
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,991
I'll hunt down the one
who slaughtered my family!

280
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,060
I promise I'll make
everything right! Please!

281
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,128
Just let her go!

282
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,465
Please don't do this!

283
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,201
Don't--don't take
anyone else away from me.

284
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,873
( Crying ) I'm begging you.

285
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,341
Please...

286
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,411
Don't kill my little sister.

287
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,281
Please don't do it!

288
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,082
I'm begging you.

289
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,118
( Crying )

290
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,824
( Swordsman sputters )

291
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,225
Don't grovel like that

292
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,295
and give your enemies
the chance to kill you!

293
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,297
- ( Tanjiro gasps )
- Swordsman: All you're doing

294
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,099
is making yourself vulnerable!

295
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,233
If it were even
a little bit effective,

296
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,503
your family would
still be alive right now!

297
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,838
How can a weakling like you

298
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,908
have any hope of finding
a way to heal his sister

299
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,043
or hunt down a demon?!

300
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,045
Don't be ridiculous!

301
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,981
The weak have no rights.

302
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,450
They don't get to make choices!
All they can do

303
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,252
is be relentlessly crushed
by the strong!

304
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:25,256
Now, maybe the demons know
of a way to cure your sister.

305
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,859
Maybe! But don't think
for even a moment

306
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,595
that any one of them
is going to respect your wishes,

307
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:33,398
just like I have
no respect for you!

308
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,066
That's reality.

309
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:38,470
And why the hell did you throw
yourself over her like that?

310
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,605
Was that your way
of protecting her?

311
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,874
Why didn't you
swing that hatchet?

312
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,476
And why would you ever
turn your back to me?

313
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,879
Those mistakes are
what led to her capture!

314
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,215
I could have easily
just skewered the both of you

315
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,416
and been done with it!

316
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,085
¶

317
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:56,221
( thinking ) Don't cry.

318
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,157
Don't succumb to sorrow.

319
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,092
This isn't the time to despair.

320
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:04,295
I know you're
devastated right now.

321
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:08,099
Your family massacred.
Your sister a demon.

322
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,768
I know it hurts.

323
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,370
I know you want to scream.

324
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,173
I understand.

325
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,576
If only I'd gotten here
half a day sooner,

326
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,312
maybe then, your family
would still be alive.

327
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,116
However, there's no way
to turn back time,

328
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:27,519
so feel it.

329
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,989
Feel the pure rage
of being unable to forgive.

330
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:34,125
Let it be what gives you
the strength to take action.

331
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,127
With that fragile resolve
of yours,

332
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,264
you can't protect your sister
or heal her,

333
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,866
and you'll never get revenge

334
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,333
for what happened
to your family!

335
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:43,334
Tanjiro: No!

336
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:45,070
( Nezuko growling )

337
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,006
- ( Shrieks )
- Tanjiro: Don't you touch her!

338
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:52,211
( Nezuko growling )

339
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,213
¶

340
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,948
( woman vocalizing )

341
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,553
( Tanjiro yells )

342
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:05,024
Swordsman: You let your emotion
drive you to charge at me.

343
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:06,158
You are a fool!

344
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,960
( Tanjiro groans )

345
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,230

346
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,101
( nezuko gasps )

347
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,441
Swordsman: Huh?
What happened to the hatchet?

348
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,043
( Gasps )

349
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,453
Right before
he went behind that tree...

350
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,323
He threw the rock,
and, at the same time,

351
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,525
he tossed the hatchet.

352
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:43,528
He was only pretending
to attack me

353
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,131
so I wouldn't realize
he was unarmed.

354
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,335
He knew he had
no way of beating me.

355
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,804
His whole plan
was to bring me down

356
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,273
after I'd knocked him out.

357
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,109
This kid.

360
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,249
She'll kill him!

363
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,561
- Nezuko didn't do it.

She'd never eat a human!

( Nezuko snarling )

366
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,436
Swordsman: Long ago,

367
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:26,838
someone else
said the same thing,

368
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,440
only to end up being devoured.

369
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:32,111
A starving demon
will eat anyone,

370
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,380
its own brothers,
sisters, parents.

371
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,183
They're rich in nutrients.

372
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,986
I've seen it
more times than I can count.

373
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,589
This girl
has been badly wounded.

374
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:47,359
She's using up a lot of energy
to heal herself.

375
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,261
And surely most of her strength

376
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,197
was drained
during her transformation,

377
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,133
so there's no question.

378
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:57,068
She's starving right now.

379
00:18:57,138 --> 00:19:00,205
She must have been craving
a feast right from the start,

380
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,940
even her own brother,

381
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,143
but she protected him

382
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,245
and turned
her attention to me.

383
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,483
I wonder if...

384
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,618
Just maybe...

385
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:14,920
These two are different.

386
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,023

388
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:34,373
Mother: We have
to leave you behind, tanjiro.

389
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,907
I'm so sorry.

390
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:39,278
Take care of nezuko.

Swordsman: Get to mount sagiri

397
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:01,266
Look for an old man
named sakonji urokodaki.

398
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,370
When you find him,
tell him giyu tomioka sent you.

399
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,674
It's cloudy, so she seems
to be all right at the moment,

400
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:12,244
but never let her
be exposed to sunlight.
