Are you finished changing?

Tanjiro: Yes.

10
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,138
Urokodaki: Tanjiro...

11
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:17,142
Now that you have officially
become a demon slayer swordsman,

12
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:20,345
I would like to explain
a few things.

13
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,481
- Tanjiro: Right.
- Urokodaki: First,

14
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,949
the demon slayer corps uniform
you're wearing

15
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:28,020
is made with
a special kind of fiber.

16
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,355
It's lightweight,
water resistant,

17
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,357
and nonflammable.

18
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,759
A low-level demon's
fangs and talons

19
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,329
are incapable
of penetrating that fabric.

20
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,232
Tanjiro: It's that strong?

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,900
Urokodaki: Impressive, hmm?

22
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,636
Now, as for the nichirin sword,

23
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,572
its color varies
from owner to owner,

24
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,308
and each hue
has its own unique traits.

25
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:54,646
However, there aren't many
demon slayers with black blades,

26
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,582
so little is known about them.

27
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,118
Some believe
they're a bad omen.

28
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:04,389
Tanjiro: What does that mean,
"bad omen"? How so?

29
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,791
Urokodaki: Black blades
are rumored to only be wielded

30
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:10,462
by a swordsman who has
little chance of going very far.

31
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,797
( Tanjiro sighs ) Oh, well.

32
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,601
I don't care
if I'm destined for greatness,

33
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,605
because, no matter what,
I'll turn nezuko back.

34
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,674
Urokodaki: Yes, you will.

35
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:26,078
I have no doubt
you'll make that happen.

36
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,279
Tanjiro: Thank you.

37
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,683
Urokodaki: One last thing. Here.

38
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,087
A box to carry your sister
during the day,

39
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,424
built from a very light wood
called kirikumo cedar.

40
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,428
It's been coated in rock lacquer
to reinforce the exterior

41
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,630
and make it even more durable.

42
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,900
Tanjiro: Thanks, urokodaki.

43
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,701
Oh, wow!

44
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,337
You weren't kidding!
It is light!

49
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,202
Tanjiro: Nezuko, from now on,
we'll always be together.

50
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,841
Okay. I'm off.

51
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,511

Nezuko?

59
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,589
Urokodaki: This is only a guess,
but I believe

60
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,793
nezuko can recover her strength
by sleeping,

61
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:25,230
instead of consuming human flesh
as other demons do.

62
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:27,866

63
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,274

he was right next to satoko

I want to hear what happened
last night from you.

Kazumi: This is
where satoko vanished,

you don't believe me.

I'm flattered that you're
so concerned about this,

00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,374
You've got this!

185
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,176
Eighth form!

186
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,280
Waterfall basin!

187
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,115
¶

188
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:18,456
okodaki: Tanjiro,
listen to me closely.

189
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:20,526
There's only one demon

190
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:24,396
that has the kind of blood
that can turn a human, just one,

191
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:28,200
that's it, in the entire world.

192
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,935
Tanjiro: Just one?

193
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,538
Urokodaki: The first demon
there ever was.

194
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,607
He's been here
for more than a thousand years.

195
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,545
He's your target, the one
who attacked your family.

196
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:43,014
More importantly,
I believe he's also the one

197
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,484
who might know how to turn
your sister back into a human.

198
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,420
( Tanjiro gasps )

199
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,956
Urokodaki:
That demon's name is...

200
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,825
( Crowd screaming )

201
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,630
Urokodaki: Muzan kibutsuji.

202
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,900
Tanjiro: Eighth form!
Waterfall basin!

203
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,368
¶

204
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,371
I missed.

205
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:08,306
I missed
all the vulnerable spots,

206
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,776
because I switched forms
midway through.

207
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,179
( Kazumi gasps )

208
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,187
Tanjiro: They all have
the same exact scent.

209
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,958
Usually, demons
don't work together.

210
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,996
Which means one demon
has split into three.

211
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:33,265
I have to take them all out

212
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,267
and still protect these two.

213
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,534
Don't lose your nerve.

214
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,336
Make him talk to you

215
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,738
about muzan kibutsuji

216
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,176
and about how to turn a demon
back into a human!

217
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,213
- Total concentration.
- ( Kazumi gasps )

218
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,548
Tanjiro: Water breathing!

219
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,019
Second form! Water wheel!

220
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,355
( Demon groans )

221
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,857
Tanjiro: Missed again.

222
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,966
( Grunts )

223
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:09,234
I can't chase him,

224
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,236
and I can't take a full swing

225
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,439
while I'm protecting
these two, either.

226
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:16,174
- Demon: Bastard!
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

227
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,176
Demon: She'll go stale!

228
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:21,779
Move out of the way,
you little punk!

229
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,581
The girl's 16 already.

230
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,651
She's losing flavor
by the second!

231
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:29,120
If I don't eat her soon,
there won't be any left at all!

232
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,923
( Kazumi gasps )

233
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,462
Demon 2:
Take a breath, other me.

234
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,731
Calm down. No big deal.

235
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,067
Nights like this happen, right?

236
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,601
I've already feasted

237
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,271
on plenty of this town's
16-year-old girls,

238
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,208
and every one of them
was meaty and delicious.

239
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,077
I am satisfied with that.

240
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:55,147
Demon 1: Well, I'm not
satisfied at all, other me!

241
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,616
I want to devour all of them!

242
00:16:58,686 --> 00:16:59,951
Kazumi: You monster!

243
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,487
Bring satoko back,

244
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:03,288
the girl you took
the other night!

245
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,956
( Demon 3 grinding teeth,
hissing )

246
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,125
( Both gasp )

247
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,630
( Demons hissing,
grinding teeth )

248
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,566
Demon 2: Satoko?

249
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,037
Which one was that?

250
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,106
( Kazumi gasping )

251
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,641
Demon 2: If her hairpin
is in this collection,

252
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:27,513
then I'm afraid
I've already eaten her. Sorry.

253

( Groans )

258
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,225
Tanjiro: I missed again.

259
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,761
He moves so fast! ( Gasps )

260
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,597
Oh, crap!
I'm too close to the wall!

261
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,102
- ( Demon 1 grunts )
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

262
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,140
( Demon 1 babbles )

263
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,643
( Groans )

264
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:36,314
Demon 2: Why in the world
would a demon

265
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,916
be traveling with a mere human?

266
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:39,718
( Nezuko growling )

267
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,189
Demon 2:
What's the meaning of this?

268
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,258
Who are these two?

269
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,995
Why would a swordsman and demon
be working together?

270
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:59,271
It doesn't make any sense.

271
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:03,342
( Neck creaking )

272
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,121
( Nezuko panting )

273
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,359

277
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,151
Tanjiro: Nezuko.

278
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,592
Urokodaki: I don't know if this
will be of any comfort or not,

279
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,794
but while nezuko was asleep,

280
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,797
I used
hypnotic suggestion on her.

281
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,533
Tanjiro: What for?

282
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,402
Urokodaki: I convinced her
that all humans are her family.

283
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,005
I told her to protect them.

284
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:09,475
"The demons are your enemies."

285
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,479
( Nezuko growling )

286
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,549
Tanjiro: Nezuko!

287
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,951
Urokodaki:
"If a demon harms a human,

288
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,587
never forgive them!"
