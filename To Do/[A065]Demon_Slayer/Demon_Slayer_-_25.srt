helping me train later?

While I'm sleeping,
if I stop breathing right,

5

can you hit me
with these carpet beaters?

because I was left behind,

of anything Tanjiro shows me.

How can you be so cruel?

97

is trying to master

110
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,255
is a skill called
total concentration, constant.

111
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,659
By doing total concentration
breathing all day and all night,

112
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,262

will skyrocket.

This is utterly impossible!

119
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,147
Tanjiro: I still can't do total
concentration breathing all day

120

unless I really
put my mind to it,

121
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,418
but I bet you two can.

122
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,087
Go like this,

123
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,222
and your lungs will expand.

124
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,290
Your blood shakes,

125
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,492
your sinew feels
like "boom! Boom!"

126
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,094

you gotta stop.

Shinobu: Come now.
We're talking about a skill

133
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,311
I'd call very elementary,
so what's the problem here?

134
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,881

it does require ample effort.

Was I wrong about that?

140
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,933
I guess it was just too much!

141
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,735
Oh, well, then. Don't you worry.

142
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,471
You can't do it,

But then, one day...

it didn't make me feel sad.

184
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,182
( Villagers chattering )

185
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,753
Woman: Excuse me.
Do you have a minute?

186
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,621
Man: Huh?

187
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,693
Slayer: I'm curious.

188
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,229
Why is that child
is all tied up?

189
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,098
Is she a criminal, perhaps?

190
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,832
Man: Isn't it obvious?

191
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,834
She's dirty and flea-ridden.

192
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,137
Besides,
she might try to escape.

193
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,908
Slayer: Hello there.

194
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,442
How are you?

195
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,178
My name is kanae Kocho.

196
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,347
What is your name?

197
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,253
( Gasps )

198
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,722
Man: She doesn't have a name,
all right?

199
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:51,790
She never got one.

200
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,260
Happy now? Now go away!

201
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,462
( Gasps )

202
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,465
Shinobu: Please
don't touch my sister.

203
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,867
Man: What's the deal
with you two?

204
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,470
If you're so interested in her,
then buy her!

205
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,139
( Shinobu sighs )

206
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,474
Very well, then. We will.

207
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,875
Is this enough?

208
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,211
( Coins clink )

209

( man gasps )

211
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,954
Hey! Get back here!

212
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,889
Shinobu: You should hurry
and pick all that up!

213
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,091
There's a strong wind
and a hungry crowd.

214
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,761
Kanae: Uh,
are you sure about this?

215
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,097
- Shinobu: Yes.
- Kanae: We must be going now!

216
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:35,033
Man: Hands off!
This is my money!

217
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,902
Kanae: What a commotion.

218
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:01,794
Shinobu: Sister, what do we do?!

219
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,797
This little girl
is completely helpless!

220
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:05,898
Kanae: Hmm?

221
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,802
Shinobu: She can't do
anything on her own.

222
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,203
She has to be told.

223
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,806
She won't even eat
unless I say to,

224
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,208
no matter how hungry she is!

225
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,076
Kanae: Oh, she'll be fine.

226
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,545
Shinobu: What are we
going to do with her?

227
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,281
Kanae: Now, now.
Don't you worry so.

228
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,950
I hate to see
that smile I love disappear.

229
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,085
( Shinobu groans )

230
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:29,421
I'm serious!
Taking a kid under our wing

231
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,357
who can't even think
for herself is reckless!

232
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,292
Kanae: Well,
you do have a point.

233
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,094
Shinobu: She can't
make decisions,

234
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,162
even simple ones!

235
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,098
Kanae: Next time
you're on your own,

236
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,434
flip this coin
to help you make a choice.

237
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,236
That sound good?

238
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,838
Shinobu: Oh, come on!

239
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:49,307
Kanae: How can you be
so cross with Kanao here?

240
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,109
Look how adorable she is!

241
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,911
Shinobu: What kind
of reason is that?

242
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,780
Kanae: As long as one
is given a chance,

243
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,916
a person's soul will open up.

244
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,118
When you fall in love someday,

245
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,854
you'll change, too, Kanao.

246
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,157
( Birds chirping )

Keep it up!

- Tanjiro: Keep going!

249
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,464
Even more! That's it!

250
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,066
- You got this, Zenitsu!
- ( Zenitsu groaning )

251
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,935
Tanjiro: Don't give up!
You're doing great!

252
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,804

Tanjiro: Ah.

255
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,149
Inosuke! Inosuke!

256
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:34,753
Hey, they're bringing our
reforged nichirin swords now!

257
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,288
- Inosuke: For real?
- Tanjiro: Yeah!

258
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,756
I just heard it from the crow!

259
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:38,891
( Sniffs )

260
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,293
That's Haganezuka's scent!

261
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,361
Inosuke: Yee-hoo!

262
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,897
- ( Laughs ) Whoo!
- Tanjiro: Let's go! Let's go!

263
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,232
- ( Laughs )
- Inosuke: Whoo-hoo!

264
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,967
Tanjiro: Oh, he's right there!

265
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,570
Hey! Haganezuka!

( Bells jingling )

267
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,840
Over here!

268
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,442
Long time, no see!

269
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,977
( Flesh creaks )

270
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,780
Tanjiro:
How have you been since we--

271
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,982
( stammers )

272
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:04,917
( Haganezuka shrieks )

273
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,186
( Tanjiro gasps )
H-Haganezuka?

274
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:12,124
Haganezuka: How dare you
snap my precious sword in two?!

275
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,326
You've got a lot of nerve, boy!

276
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,194
Tanjiro: I-I'm sorry!

277
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,197
But, you know,
I-I did almost die.

278
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,933
My opponent was really strong!

279
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,401
Haganezuka: Excuses,
excuses, excuses.

280
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,138
The only person you have
to blame is yourself! Got it?!

281
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,072
If you hadn't been
so pathetically weak,

282
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,741
it wouldn't have broke!
There's no way

283
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,343
it would have just snapped
like that otherwise!

284
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,877
Tanjiro: But I...

285
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,879
Haganezuka:
I'm going to kill you!

286
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,148
( Both screaming )

287
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,350
Haganezuka: Slice you!
( Muttering )

288
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,884
You get back here!

289
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,955
Shinobu: Is this
a new training regimen?

290
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,489
Aoi: I don't think so.

291
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,425

292
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,827
Man: What can I say?

293
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,029
Haganezuka is very passionate.

294
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,430
Tanjiro: He is.

295
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,300
Man: He loves his swords
more than any person.

296
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:59,103
Even among other sword makers,
he is one of a kind.

297
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,505
Tanjiro: I can believe it.

298
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,440
( Haganezuka grumbles )

299
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,910
Man: Oh, you may
address me as kanamori.

300
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:09,113
I was the one who forged
Master Inosuke's swords.

301
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,451
I hope they
will be useful in battle.

302

Kanamori: Ah, beautiful,
aren't they?

305
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,864
The dull sheen of that
indigo-gray hue is wonderful,

306
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,532
a fine color for a sword.

307
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,334
Tanjiro: Inosuke, I'm so happy

308
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,804
you're getting
a great replacement.

309
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,738
Inosuke: Huh?

310
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,808
Kanamori: How do you like
the hilts on them?

311
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,476
This is actually the first time

312
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:40,345
I've ever forged blades
for a dual-wielder.

313
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,413
( Cheek stretching )

314
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,281

Kanamori:
I'm gonna skin you alive!

321
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:02,835
You bastard! Are you
trying to provoke me?!

322
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,969
Tanjiro: I'm sorry, sir!
Please forgive him!

- Tanjiro: We're sorry!

326
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,310
Kanamori: That's it!
You're a dead man!

327
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,978
Tanjiro: We're sorry!

328

Kanamori: Unbelievable!
Just unbelievable!

329
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,250
- Tanjiro: We're sorry...
- Kanamori: I can't believe

330
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,519
he smashed a stone
against my babies!

331
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:21,387
Tanjiro: We're sorry.

332
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,027

doing a great job!

more rice balls! Yeah!

( Singers vocalizing )

338
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,947
My body's stronger now.

339
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,150
I can't wait to swing
my nichirin sword...

340
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,286
With these hands!

341
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,757
I did it!

00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,706
I grabbed it!

Let's go!

351
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,042
This water smells bad.

352
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,778
I shouldn't splash it on her.

359
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,326
Both: Well, then...

360
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,129
( Zenitsu yelling )

361
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,733
( Inosuke grunting )

362
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,702
I'm not gonna lose!

363
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,740
Shinobu: All right, say, "ahh"!

364
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,942
Tanjiro: Ahh.

365
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,143
Shinobu: Good!

366
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,345
Looks like your jaw
is as good as new.

367
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,814
You can close your mouth now.

368
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,150
That ends the exam.

369
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,085
Since you're
in physically good health,

370
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,821
you're fit to carry out
your missions now.

371
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,889
Tanjiro: So I'm done training?

372
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,093
Shinobu: Yes.
Next is in-field combat.

373
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,227
Tanjiro: Great!

374
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,029
Oh, before I forget,

375
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,632
there's something
I wanted to ask you.

376
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:15,033
Shinobu: What is it?

377
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:17,970
Tanjiro: Have you ever heard
of the hinokami kagura?

378
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,237
Shinobu: I have not.

379
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,305
Tanjiro: Huh?!

380
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,240
I, uh--well, then,

381
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,776
what about fire breathing?

382
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,977
Shinobu: Never heard of it.

383
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,979
( Tanjiro whimpers )

384
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,047
Well, these are techniques

385
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:31,183
that I learned in my family
growing up.

386
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,351
Shinobu: Mm. Mm-hmm.

387
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:35,387
I see.

388
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,322
So you're saying your father

389
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,525
seemed to be using
fire breathing.

390
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,996
All I can tell you is that
flame breathing does exist,

391
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,398
but that's not fire breathing.

392
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,201
Tanjiro: Huh?
They're not the same thing?

393
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,804
Shinobu: I don't quite know
the details myself.

394
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,406
I'm sorry. But I do know

395
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,275
that they're very strict
about the exact phrasing.

396
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,078
Flame breathing
must never be referred to

397
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,213
as "fire breathing."

398
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,215
The flame hashira, Rengoku,

399
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,217
might know something
about this technique,

400
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,086
but unfortunately
he's out on a mission.

401
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,355
Tanjiro: I understand.

402
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:13,025
And thank you for everything
that you've taught me.

403
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,361
I'll ask Mr. Rengoku
when I see him again.

404
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,097
- Shinobu: Good.
- Tanjiro: For now, I'll be off.

405
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,033
- Shinobu: Tanjiro.
- Tanjiro: Yes?

406
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,703
Shinobu: You'll do great things.

407
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,172
( Tanjiro sighs )

408
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,707
Thanks!

409
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,676
( Insects chirping )

410
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:36,348
( Door slides )

411
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,859
She still hasn't gotten up.

412
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,665
I know that they said you could
sleep as much as you wanted

413
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,734
to recover all your strength.

414
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:58,937
Even so, when you
don't open your eyes,

415
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,673
I worry a bit.

416
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,675
( Nezuko breathing softly )

417
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,744
( Tanjiro sighs )

418
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:07,946
Guess what? In not too long,

419
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,815
I'll be leaving this place.

420
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,018
My body's healed,
and I'm stronger.

421
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,289
I'm still practicing
the new techniques, too.

422
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:21,694
And those two
should be with me as well.

423
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,962
Having them close
gives me courage.

424
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,232
( Sighs )

425
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,433
Yeah.

426
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:31,035
I'm sure you'd agree...

427
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,105
They're both good people.

428
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,910
To turn you back into a human,
I have to defeat strong demons

429
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,279
and then send their blood
to miss Tamayo.

430
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:43,349
Am I capable of doing that?

431
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,720
Nezuko: I know you can do it,
big brother.

432
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,321
( Tanjiro gasps )

433
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,323
( Nezuko breathing softly )

434
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,926
¶

435
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,932
Tanjiro: Thanks, Nezuko,
for spurring me on.

436
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,034
I vow to stay strong.

437
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:11,009
( Train whistle blows )

438
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:12,344
( Woman screams )

439
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,346
( Chorus vocalizing )

440
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:22,887
¶

441
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:24,823
( singing in Japanese )
