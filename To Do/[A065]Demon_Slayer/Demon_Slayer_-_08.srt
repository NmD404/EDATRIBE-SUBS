In fact, give me two of 'em!

181
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,622
Shopkeeper: Uh, okay.

182
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,257
¶

183
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,862
( gasps )

184
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,365
( Tanjiro sighs )

185
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,867
( Slurping )

186
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,838
Thanks for the great meal!

187
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,840
It was delicious!

188
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,374
Shopkeeper:
I'm glad you liked it!

189
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:37,643
Come back again!

190
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,244
Anytime!

191
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,780
Tanjiro: I'm so sorry, nezuko.

192
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,915
I left you behind.

193
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,383
- ( Nezuko grunts )
- Tanjiro: Eh?

194
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,119
- What is it? What's wrong?
- ( Nezuko growls )

195
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,254
( Tanjiro gasps )

196
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:57,796
Are you out here
waiting for us?

197
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,065
Boy: I'm here on her orders.

198
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm supposed
to bring you back with me.

199
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,802
Tanjiro: You know, I could
have just tracked your scent.

200
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,204
Boy: Our hiding place
is protected

201
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,140
by a concealment spell.

202
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,741
You'd never have found it.

203
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,043
Tanjiro: Concealment?

204
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:14,346
Boy: Before we go,

205
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,949
did you know that girl
is a demon?

206
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,351
And not much to look at.

207
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,290
Tanjiro: What was that?
Did he just--

208
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,292
doesn't that mean ugly?

209
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,560
But who--

210
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,829
¶

211
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,565
nezuko?!

212
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,567
You've gotta be
out of your mind!

213
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,036
Who would look at nezuko
and think she's ugly?!

214
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,372
She was the most beautiful girl
in our whole town!

215
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,740
You know that?!

216
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,911
- Boy: Let's go.
- Tanjiro: I know!

217
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,179
We're already coming!

218
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,114
But take back
what you said about her!

219
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,383
You just need
to get a good look at her

220
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:55,287
somewhere with better lighting!
Come on! Over there! Let's go!

221
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:04,196
I know what it is!
It's this stupid muzzle!

222
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,131
That's the only explanation.

223
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,066
You just need
to behold nezuko's beauty

224
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,468
when she's not wearing
this ugly thing!

225
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,270
Huh?

226
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,808
Boy: Hurry it up,
while nobody's looking.

227
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:18,844
( Tanjiro gasps )

228
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,114
( Gasps )

229
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,621
I could have sworn
that street was a dead end.

230
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,223
Boy: Pay attention!

231
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,227
Now, make sure you don't
offend the lady in any way,

232
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,296
because I couldn't care less
what happens to you.

233
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,166
I only brought you here
because she insisted. Got it?

234
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,834
Tanjiro: Uh, okay, sure.

235
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,170
( Knock on door )

236
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,038
Doctor: Come in.

237
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,040
Boy: I've returned, my lady.

238
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,243
Doctor: I'm glad you made it.

239
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,379
Tanjiro: I'm sorry
that I left everything

240
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,383
for you to take care of.
So how's she doing?

241
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,585
Doctor: She'll make
a full recovery.

242
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,788
But her husband
has to be locked up.

243
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,823
He's restrained
in the basement.

244
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,597
Tanjiro: Isn't it difficult
treating humans?

245
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,198
All of that blood...

246
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,000
( Groans )

247
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,202
Boy: Is that what you think,

248
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:20,138
she chokes back her own drool
when she treats a human?

249
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,408
'Cause demons
can't control themselves?

250
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,411
Tanjiro: Sorry.

251
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,613
Doctor: Don't do that.

252
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,881
Why would you
resort to violence?

253
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,549
( Boy sighs )

254
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,486
Doctor: Did I ever
introduce myself?

255
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,155
Apologies. My name is tamayo,

256
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,824
and this is yushiro.

257
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,026
I hope you two can be friends.

258
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,360
( Both gasps )

259
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,029
( Yushiro muttering )

260
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,233
Tanjiro: That seems unlikely.

261
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,568
Tamayo: It's not
all that difficult,

262
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:53,038
at least, not for me,

263
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,507
but it's different
for other demons.

264
00:12:55,575 --> 00:13:00,446
My body's physiology has gone
through considerable changes,

265
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,015
and I've removed
kibutsuji's curse.

266
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,517
Tanjiro: What curse?

267
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,920
And what kind of changes?

268
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:16,962
Tamayo: Come with me.

269
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,399
( Nezuko sighs )

270
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:24,069
Tanjiro: Hey, nezuko,
that's bad manners.

271
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,538
( Tamayo chuckles )
It's quite all right.

272
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,406
Make yourselves at home.

273
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,942
Tanjiro: Sorry about that.

274
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,479
Tamayo: As I was saying,
I made several adjustments

275
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,014
to our bodies so that we
could continue to live

276
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,884
without harming
any human beings.

277
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:42,154
We can survive on just
a small amount of human blood.

278
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,955
Tanjiro: Wait. Blood?

279
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,357
So you're saying...

280
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,626
Tamayo: I understand
if you find it distasteful,

281
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,163
but I buy it
from those in poverty.

282
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,965
I tell them
I'll use it for transfusions.

283
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:58,370
But, of course, I never take
enough blood to impair anyone.

284
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,238
Tanjiro: No wonder.

285
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,174
That would explain
why neither one of them

286
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,910
has the same scent
as a normal demon.

287
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:08,580
Except, they still
need human blood.

288
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,449
If that's the case,
what about nezuko?

289
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:15,453
Tamayo: And yushiro needs
even less blood than I do,

290
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:18,256
since I'm the one
who turned him into a demon.

291
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,726
- Tanjiro: Huh? You turned him?
- ( Nezuko grunts )

292
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:23,061
Tanjiro: But how?

293
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,063
Tamayo: How did I do it?

294
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,398
As far as anyone knows,

295
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,001
kibutsuji is the only one
who can create demons,

296
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,137
and that's
more or less accurate.

297
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,340
It took me over 200 years,

298
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:39,011
and, after all that,
I could only transform yushiro.

299
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,749
- Tanjiro: Two...
- ( Nezuko grunts )

300
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,151
Tanjiro: 200 years?

301
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,154
It took you 200 years
before you could figure out

302
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,623
how to transform
just one person?!

303
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,560
How old are you,
miss tamayo?! ( Groans )

304
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,162
Yushiro: You should know better
than to ask a lady her age!

305
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,430
Tanjiro: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

306
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,033
Tamayo: Yushiro,
if you hit that boy again,

307
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,035
I'll make you regret it.

308
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,436
Yushiro: Yes, ma'am!

309
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:08,039
She's beautiful,
even when she's angry.

310
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,374
( Tanjiro coughs )

311
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:10,576
Tamayo: I'm sorry.

312
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,778
I'd like
to clarify that further.

313
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:16,714
Creating more demons
is not one of my goals.

314
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,585
And I only do so
when necessary,

315
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:23,655
the terminally ill or injured,
only when they won't survive.

316
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:28,394
And, even in those cases,
I always ask in advance

317
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,163
if they truly prefer
to live on as a demon.

318
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,566
( Tanjiro sniffs )

319
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,205
Her scent is pure.
No sign of deception.

320
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,340
I think I can trust her.

321
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,741
( Fists creak )

322
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,943
Miss tamayo...

323
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,213
Once someone becomes a demon,

324
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,349
is there a way
to turn them back again?

325
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,351
( Singers vocalizing )

326
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,187
( Ball bouncing, ringing )

327
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,029
( Demon 1 sighs )

328
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,232
Hmm?

329
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,068
Demon 2: You see anything?

330
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,640
Demon 1: Yes.
I can see their footprints.

331
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,009
No question, this is it.

332
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,615
They make a sharp turn
right over there...

333
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,054
Three of them, headed that way.

334
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:32,458
One's carrying
some kind of oversized box.

335
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,793
( Ball rings )

336
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:39,131
Demon 2: I wonder how
we should kill them. ( Laughs )

337
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,533
I can feel the power.

338
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,871
I can feel the blood he gave me
coursing through my veins.

339
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,874
Demon 1: And of course
we're going to be ruthless

340
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,542
when we kill them.

341
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,346
Tamayo: A way to make
a demon turn human again?

342
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,148
There is.

343
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,283
( Tanjiro gasps )
Please tell me how--

344
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,688
yushiro: You keep your distance
from lady tamayo!

345
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,690
Tamayo: Yushiro.

346
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,624
( Yushiro gasps ) I'm sorry.

347
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,294
I only threw him.
I didn't hit him.

348
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,629
- Tamayo: Neither is acceptable.
- Yushiro: Right!

349
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,500
Tanjiro: Ah, man,
that really smarts.

350
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,368
Can you please tell me how?

351
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:20,706
Tamayo: There's always
some kind of medicine or aid,

352
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,308
no matter the wound or ailment.

353
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:27,913
I don't know how to turn
a demon back into a human yet,

354
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,848
but there must be a way.

355
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,717
( Tanjiro sighs )

356
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:35,453
Tamayo: And I promise
we are going to find it.

357
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,857
We are dedicated to establishing
such a treatment.

358
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:43,862
Toward that end, I'd like to
ask you to do something for me.

359
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:47,199
In order to discover a cure,
the first step

360
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,468
is studying the blood
of several different demons,

361
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:53,471
which means
I have two favors to ask you.

362
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:57,675
First, I'd like permission
to study your sister's blood.

363
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,145
Second, I need more samples.

364
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:02,147
I'd like you
to retrieve them from demons

365
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:04,616
as closely related
to kibutsuji as possible.

366
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,887
Nezuko's condition
is extremely rare,

367
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:11,223
perhaps entirely unique.

368
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,692
I understand she was asleep
for two straight years.

369
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:18,230
I believe her body changed
during that time.

370
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,898
In most cases,

371
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,834
that long without food,
neither human flesh

372
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:25,571
nor even the blood
of some kind of animal,

373
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,374
any demon would
undoubtedly grow violent.

374
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,443
Yushiro: Lady tamayo
is as beautiful as ever.

375
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,379
She'll be
even more beautiful tomorrow.

376
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,583
Tamayo: However,
against all odds,

377
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,185
nezuko is showing
none of those signs.

378
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:44,856
That miracle could be
the key to finding a solution.

379
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:45,824
Tanjiro: Nezuko.

380
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,396
( Nezuko grunts )

381
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,430
( Chuckles )

382
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,466
Tamayo: But my second request

383
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,468
is not a simple one.

384
00:18:56,536 --> 00:19:01,139
When I say, "demons closely
related to kibutsuji,"

385
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,808
I mean demons with powers

386
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:06,478
such like those
of kibutsuji himself.

387
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:10,415
Extracting blood from that kind
of demon won't be easy.

388
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,950
What do you think?

389
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:15,421
Are these requests acceptable,
if not pleasant?

390
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:25,431
Tanjiro: If it's really
the only way, then I'll do it.

391
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,833
Besides, if you research
all that blood

392
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,502
and you can create
this medicine,

393
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,805
then it won't
just be nezuko, will it?

394
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,575
A whole lot of other people
will be saved, too.

395
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,811
Tamayo: Ah.

396
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,514
Yes, they will.

397
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,782
( Tanjiro gasps )

398
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,652
( Yushiro growling )

399
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,321
( Gasps ) Get down!

400
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,691
¶

401
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,266
- ( Balls ring )
- ( Demon 2 laughs )

402
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:02,800
( Demon 1 chuckles )

403
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,602
Did you decide
how we'll kill them?

404
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:05,937
Demon 2: Ruthlessly!

405
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:06,772
Hah! Hah!

406
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,478
( Laughs )

407
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,880
( Demon 1 growls )

408
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,415
( Yushiro gasps )

409
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,023
¶

410
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,825
( singing in Japanese )
