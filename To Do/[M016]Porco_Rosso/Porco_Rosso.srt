you're going to end up dead,

to another pilot's funeral.

where'd you find the girl?

They took off to find work.

385
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,455
They took off?
Then who's going to design my plane?

386
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,789
Fio will do it.

FIO: Wait!

393
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:02,277
Are you leaving because I'm a woman?
Or is it because I'm too young?

394
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,321
Actually, it's both, kiddo.

395
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,490
Okay. That's fair.

396
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,286
But tell me what you think
it takes to make a pilot great.

397
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,081
Experience?

398
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,041
No, it's intuition.

399
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,127
I just knew
you weren't gonna say experience.

400
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,046
Grandpa said
you flew solo your first week

401
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,049
and were a great pilot
right from the very start.

402
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,010
- Isn't that true?
- Hmm.

403
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:31,556
PORCO: Yeah, but that was in 1910,
when I was 17.

404
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,185
Seventeen? That's the same age I am.

but I guarantee you I have the talent.

She's my granddaughter, she'll do fine.

Now with me,
I was fixing engines at the age of 12.

That's your bed. Breakfast is at 7:00.

in the bathroom.

I've decided to loan you the rest.

You were up all night?

419
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,099
Here's a rough draft of the design.

420
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,351
So what do you think?

421
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,104
I tweaked the wing section a bit,

422
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,149
which should make the plane
fly at least five knots faster.

423
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:09,112
Look, I dug up the original blueprints.
The design is really radical, huh?

424
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:13,325
Wooden monocoque wings,
with extreme angles of incidence.

425
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,076
I've never seen anything like it.

426
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,665
Yeah, they only made one,
then they decided it was too dangerous.

427
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,292
No pilot could fly it.

428
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,837
I found it covered in dust
in a warehouse.

429
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,255
I can see why.

430
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,715
With the wings angled like that,

431
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,843
I'm really surprised
you could even get it off the water.

432
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,429
Takeoffs and landings
can be a little bit tricky.

433
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,807
But get her up to speed,
and she handles like a dream.

434
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,101
Why don't you try increasing
the angle of incidence

435
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,771
by half a degree on the wing?

436
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,523
The rest looks fine.

437
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:48,443
So you're giving me the job?
Oh, thank you for trusting a woman.

438
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,822
All right, you've got the job.
But on one condition, Fio.

439
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,203
No more staying up all night,
or your work will start getting sloppy.

440
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,330
Also, it's really bad for your complexion.

441

You got it.

442
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,960
To be honest, I couldn't sleep last night

443
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,379
because I was afraid
you wouldn't give me the job.

444
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,713
I should sleep fine tonight.

Marco, you're crazy.
What are you doing back in Italy?

to come and go as I please.

already know you're in the country.

00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,441
Were you followed?

You've got to get out of Italy now.

I've seen your arrest warrant,
deserting the Italian Air Force,

511
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,245
entering the country illegally,
being a blatantly unpatriotic pig.

-(LAUGHING)
- This is no time to laugh, Marco.

513
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,335
They've got it in for you.
They want to confiscate your plane.

514

Man, this movie stinks.

515
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,174
Marco, why don't you
come back to the Air Force?

516
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:48,219
I've got influence now.
I could work something out.

517
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,222
Thanks for the offer,
but I'd rather be a pig than a fascist.

518
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:54,017
Then you better keep your plane
out of the skies.

519
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,521

is if you fly for our country.

You realize, if they catch a pig,
they won't give him a fair trial.

I understand. Thanks, Ferrari.
Give my regards to the guys.

I borrowed this truck so we can
take your seaplane to the lake.

532

We're ready to give it a test flight.

533
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,960
No test flights.
I'm getting out of here today.

534
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:06,798
That's ridiculous. I refuse to
give you the plane without testing it.

535
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,217
Plus it'll take at least a day
to take the plane apart

536
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,468
and transport it to the lake.

537
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,095
I don't have a choice.

538
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:16,015
I want you to take a good look
behind us, will you? Do it slowly.

539
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,768
That's the fascists' secret police.

540
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,729
They're following us.

00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,360
Because they like my pretty red plane.

Problem is, they don't like me flying it.

if you haven't done anything wrong.

I know, that's why
you need to have the engineer with you.

I can help you.

- Thank you!

I'll have the gun out in two seconds.

843

These bills are kind of expensive.

844

No, they're not.

846
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,047
I will gladly fight
for the woman that I love.

847
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,465
Good.

848
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,717
All right!

849
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:45,428
The fight will take place
first thing tomorrow morning.

850
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:48,014

such an honorable thing,

851

01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,989

857
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:10,662

858
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,205
Okay.

to make that deal?

860
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,549
Well, I'm sorry.

861
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,218
I guess I shouldn't have intervened.

862
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,471
I'm just a stupid little girl.

863
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:36,313
Fio, I should thank you
for saving my life back there.

864
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,065
You really put yourself on the line.

865
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,859
So thanks.

866
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,445

we're in this thing together now.

867
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,572

868
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,743

Well, I hate that word,

01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:59,919
but somehow, when you say it,
it doesn't sound so bad.

I guess I was really scared.

885
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,599
I should've padded those bills.

886
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,060

You know, I've heard a lot about
Captain Marco Rossellini.

901
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,147
My father was in his fighter unit.

902
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,151
He told me that Marco once
landed his seaplane in a raging sea

903
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,528
to save the life of an enemy pilot.

904

Huh?

Yeah, you've heard of the fairy tale
where the girl kisses the frog

908
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,543

a handsome prince.

Here's a winner.

920
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,250
It was the last summer of the Great War.

921
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:31,214
We were flying over the Adriatic
on a routine surveillance patrol,

922
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,091
headed toward Istria.

923
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,099
PORCO: My good buddy Berlini
was right beside me.

924
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:45,645
He had just gotten married to Gina
of the Hotel Adriano,

925
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,482
and I was his best man.

926
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,318
But the war called,

927
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:55,863
<i>so we had to go back into battle
right after the ceremony.</i>

928
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:08,001
Suddenly, we were in the middle
of the worst dogfight of my life.

929
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:19,304
Friends and enemies were falling
all around me like flies.

930
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:22,140
I had three planes
trying to chase me down,

931
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,684
and all I thought about was myself.

932
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:28,187
Soon I realized
I was the only one left from my unit.

933
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:30,898
But the enemy never let up.

934
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,651
I flew my guts out trying to get away.

935
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,862
My hands and feet went numb.

936
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,364
I could feel myself starting to black out.

937
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,741
I was sure I was going to die.

938
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:43,328
Then suddenly,
everything around me turned white.

939
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:44,454
White?

940
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,915
Yeah. It was the strangest
thing I'd ever seen.

941
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:51,961
The light was so pure,
I figured I must be in heaven.

942
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,756
Then I realized
I had just flown into a cloud.

943
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,924
! was so exhausted,

944
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,844
I couldn't hold onto the stick
to fly my plane.

945
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,388
But the plane just kept on flying.

946
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,792
It flew by itself?

947
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,293
Yeah.

948
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:36,339
It was perfectly quiet,
and the sky was beautiful.

949
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,802
Then I saw this strange band of white
high above me.

950
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,166

951
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,589
Come back here!
Where do you think you're going?

952
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:33,229
What about Gina?
You can't leave her alone.

953
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:34,939
Let me go instead.

01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,232

I was skimming just above the sea,

01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,284
God was telling you
it wasn't your time yet.

958
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,119
You think?

959
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,288
Seems to me
he was telling me I was a pig

960
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,874
and maybe I deserved to be all alone.

961
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,543
You can't believe that.
You're a good person.

962
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,630
No, the good guys were
the ones who died.

963
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,006
Or maybe I'm dead

964
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:45,551
and life as a pig is
the same thing as hell.

01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:49,186
- Excuse me, let me through, please.
- Five. Six.

1190
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:50,812
Seven!

1191
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:52,397
<i>Gina! Wait!</i>

1192
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,441
(EXCLAIMS) Eight.

1193
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,737
Marco. Marco, get up.

1194
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,659
I don't wanna see you breaking
any more hearts,

1195
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:04,868
you hear me?

1196
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:10,874
Nine!

1197
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,170
- Yay!
- Porco!

1198
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,174
The winner!

1199
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:21,009
Porco, thank you!

1200
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:23,470
Yeah. Piece of cake.

1201
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:31,937
Now listen up, everybody.

1202
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,856
The Italian Air Force is on its way here.

1203
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:37,442
So anybody in trouble
with the Italian authorities

1204
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:38,985
better move on out.

1205
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,780
Come to my place.
Drinks are on the house.

1206
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:42,864
(CHEERING)

1207
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:45,492
Okay, gang, let's scram.

1208
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:57,462
Mr. Curtis, the fight's over.

1209
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:01,633
MAMMA AIUTO PIRATE 1: Hey, boss!
Come on, hurry up!

1210
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,345
I'm trying to be classy, you idiot.

1211
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:09,850
You're a great seaplane engineer.

1212
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:12,352
Keep it up, Miss Fio. Bye.

1213
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,271
Thank you.

1214
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:16,148
And keep up the bathing.

1215
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,693
And I wanna say thanks to you, too,
Mr. Curtis.

1216
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:23,029
Next time, I'll propose to you formally
and skip the bet.

1217
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:24,239
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

1218
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,366
But I already know my answer.

1219
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,286
Fio, you're going with Gina.

1220
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,163
No! No!

1221
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,667
I'm going with you.
You said we were in this together.

1222
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:39,838
Gina, take her
to a respectable society, please.

1223
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,926
You always do this, Marco.
It's just not fair.

1224
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,765
Sorry. Off you go.

1225
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,229
Let's go.

1226
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:03,028
(GASPS)

1227
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:30,514
Here come the Italian Air Force.

1228
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:32,182
I'm going to draw them away
from the others.

1229
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:33,350
You wanna help?

1230
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,976
Sure... (GASPS)

1231
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:38,104
Hey! Your face! Wait! Wait up!

1232
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,023
- Turn around!
- PORCO: Get away from me.

1233
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,317
CURTIS: Come on, let me see.

1234
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,453
FIO: Porco flew rings around
the Italian Air Force,

1235
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:56,039
and they never caught up
with him again.

1236
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:00,752
I stayed with Gina for a while,
and we became good friends.

1237
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,173
But soon, I decided
it was time to go back to Milan.

1238
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:11,346
Through the years, there have been
a few wars and a good deal of turmoil,

1239
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:14,307
but my friendship with Gina
has remained strong.

1240
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:19,813
I am now president
of the Piccolo Company,

1241
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:22,399
and we're busy designing
all sorts of radical new planes,

1242
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:26,486
but I take time out every summer
to visit the Hotel Adriano.

1243
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:30,615
The old pirate gangs
still hang out at Gina's bar.

1244
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,286
Mr. Curtis still writes to me sometimes,

1245
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:37,622
although he has yet to become
President of the United States.

1246
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:42,878
He says he still fondly remembers
that summer in the Adriatic.

1247
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,549
And as for how Gina's bet turned out,

1248
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,844
well, that's our secret.
