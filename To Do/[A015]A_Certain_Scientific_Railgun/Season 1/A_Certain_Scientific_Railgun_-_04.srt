1
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,291
This is true.

2
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,041
The events I'm
about to describe

3
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,750
actually happened to
our friend's sister's

4
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,083
roommate's boyfriend.

5
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,833
It was a sultry
summer evening,

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,375
and this boyfriend of hers
was strolling through a park.

7
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,916
There was no sign of
anyone else in the area.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,916
A lone woman appeared
and came up to him

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,916
asking how to get
the train station.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,208
The boyfriend was
a polite young man,

11
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,083
and he graciously began
giving her directions.

12
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,375
As he did, the woman
stared at him

13
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,083
with a vacant
look in her eyes

14
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,250
and started slowly
lifting her hands.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,625
Then, suddenly, there
was a great whoosh!

16
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,583
Why was there a whoosh?

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,166
The strange woman
removed her blouse.

18
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,625
Please! That was the
least scary story ever!

19
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,541
We did a lot to create
a creepy atmosphere,

20
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,041
but I don't think anything
can save that story.

21
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,375
Huh?

22
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,958
It really happened
to someone we know.

23
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,541
How is that not freaky?

24
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,416
The legend of the
Undresstress who disrobes

25
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,666
without warning!

26
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,041
No, not scary.

27
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,833
It's more like a
story about a sicko

28
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,958
who could use some
serious therapy.

29
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,250
Then how about
another one?

30
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,208
This site is full of
different stories.

31
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,625
"When you see the wind
turbines spin backwards,

32
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,125
it's a sign of
the apocalypse.

33
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,833
Doom is just
around the corner!"

34
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,208
"Don't cross
between districts

35
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,416
at four--forty--four
in the afternoon.

36
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,625
You'll find
yourself in the

37
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,500
Imaginary Number
School District!"

38
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,458
It says there's the tool
that'll instantly increase

39
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,916
your ability-
The Level Upper!

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,291
This is getting
ridiculous.

41
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,625
Would you stop looking at
that stupid site already?

42
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,166
Urban legends are useless.

43
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,083
They have no basis
in scientific fact.

44
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,083
This is Academy
City after all.

45
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,875
Geez, you have no
sense of adventure.

46
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,500
Besides, sometimes these stories
are based on real events

47
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,958
that have just
gotten twisted

48
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,125
until they become
crazy legends.

49
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,458
Look at this one.

50
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,791
"The boy with the power
to prevent other powers

51
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,291
from working."

52
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,125
That's a story you'd only
hear in Academy City.

53
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,958
The power to prevent
other powers from working?

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,875
That's the most absurd
one we've heard!

55
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,416
Nobody could have
that ability.

56
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,750
Please! Don't you agree, Sissy?

57
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,541
Yeah, totally crazy.

58
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,000
But if someone like
that did exist,

59
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,916
I'd sure like
to fight him.

60
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,250
But, of course,
he doesn't. So ...

61
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,750
Even more urban legends, huh?

62
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,166
A boy who somehow
has the power

63
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,500
to prevent other
powers from working.

64
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,958
Of all things.

65
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,208
We got ourselves
a cutie here.

66
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,208
Oooh, and she's
from Tokiwadai, too.

67
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,958
Wanna come with us?
Have some fun tonight?

68
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,000
We'll even take you
back to your dorm.

69
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,625
Of course, there's no telling
how late it might be by then.

70
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,791
What do these
idiots think

71
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,500
they're going to accomplish
by talking to me?

72
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,291
Pathetic.

73
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,291
Everyone else is
pretending not to see.

74
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,000
It's not that
they don't care.

75
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,875
They just can't do
anything about it.

76
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,958
If they interfered, they'd
only get themselves hurt.

77
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,583
And that wouldn't
help anyone.

78
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,291
Everyone has to look
out for themselves.

79
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,125
That's the way it works.

80
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,000
And if there is somebody
out there who would jump

81
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,208
in the middle of this
to help out a stranger.

82
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,791
Well, that person
is just a fool.

83
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,375
Oh, hey! There you are!

84
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,041
Thanks for keeping
her company, guys!

85
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,375
You shouldn't wander off like
that. You know how much I worry!

86
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,750
Okay! Thanks, again!

87
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,791
You mind telling
me who you are?

88
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,125
Why couldn't you
just play along?

89
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,750
The plan was I pretend
to be your friend

90
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,791
and casually walk
you away from here.

91
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,125
And now that's ruined!

92
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,583
Why should I follow
a convoluted plan

93
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,833
from some random guy?

94
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,250
Who do you think
you are, punk?

95
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,625
Think you can make
us look like fools?

96
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,625
Yeah, dude, you got some
kinda problem with us?

97
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,708
-Well, do ya?
-No, I just ...

98
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,666
What's the use, really?

99
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,500
Yeah, I've got a problem.

100
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,458
You guys don't have
any shame, do you?

101
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,250
All of you ganging up
like this on a single,

102
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,583
helpless young girl?

103
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,125
It's pathetic!

104
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,500
I mean, have you taken
a good look at her?

105
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,000
She's basically a kid.

106
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,250
You heard her
talking to me.

107
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,833
She sounded like a child
who hasn't learned

108
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,875
how to respect her elders.

109
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,708
She looks sweet, but she
still hasn't outgrown

110
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,166
her rebellious phase.

111
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,916
That's how young she is!

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,458
And besides that,
you can't even face

113
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,708
this defenseless child
unless you gang up on her?

114
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,250
You guys make me sick!

115
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,416
You wanna know what's making
me sick right now, Wonder Boy?

116
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
You are!

117
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,083
I just can't
understand it.

118
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,958
Why don't my
shocks work on him?

119
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,541
Could it really be like
that urban legend says?

120
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,500
No, impossible!

121
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,750
If I hit him with my full
force, he'd be toast.

122
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,541
Next time I run
into him, I'll-

123
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,083
Let's see here.

124
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,500
Can you remember any
landmarks or anything?

125
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,333
Landmarks?

126
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,208
Hm. Well, there was a crosswalk
in front of it, I think.

127
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,833
That's not really
a landmark.

128
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,416
There are kind of
a lot of them here.

129
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,791
It's you!

130
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,250
Oh. Hey, Bug Zapper.
What's up?

131
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,583
Don't call me that!

132
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,125
I'm Mikoto Misaka!

133
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,750
And today is the day I'm
gonna settle the score with you!

134
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,125
Okay, that's nice.

135
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,041
So does that mean you
aren't busy right now?

136
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,125
If it's time you want,
I've got plenty to spare.

137
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,583
Good deal.

138
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,083
Then do you think you
could help this woman

139
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,458
find where she
parked her car?

140
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,000
Huh?

141
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,083
Yeah. I know I parked it in a
lot around here some place,

142
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,125
but I can't figure
out exactly where it was.

143
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,750
Uh, hold on.

144
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,333
Why me?

145
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,125
Well, there's somewhere
important that I need to be now.

146
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,708
You've got time, so
it's fine, right?

147
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,500
No, actually,
it isn't fine!

148
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,000
You want to weasel
out of this,

149
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,458
but I'm not going
to let you!

150
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,541
And don't try to come up
with some lame excuse again,

151
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,625
because it isn't
going to work.

152
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,750
Wow. It sure is hot out,
don't you think?

153
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,416
What ... what are you
doing that for?

154
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,666
I've been walking around
in the blazing sun

155
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,208
for quite a while now.

156
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,958
I'm dripping with sweat.

157
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,500
What is with this woman?

158
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,708
I have no idea. I just met
her a few minutes ago.

159
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,625
Anyway, lady, would you
please put your shirt back on?

160
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,208
That woman is
being assaulted!

161
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,875
Huh? Is that boy ripping
off her clothes?

162
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,250
-I think he is!
-No, really.

163
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,458
Huh?

164
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,541
You've got it all wrong!

165
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,625
Hey, get back here!

166
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,000
Excuse me ...

167
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:38,958
If you're going to run off,
could you at least

168
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,750
give me my shirt
back, please?

169
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,208
Whatever, hurry up and
put it back on, okay?

170
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,666
People are
starting to stare!

171
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,125
That was refreshing.
I feel so much better now.

172
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,833
What's the deal
with that woman?

173
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,041
Just randomly stripping
her clothes off in public?

174
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,333
Huh? It really happened
to someone we know.

175
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,041
How is that not freaky?

176
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,000
The legend of
the Undresstress

177
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,875
who disrobes without warning!

178
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,958
No way, that was
just a story.

179
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,916
-Hello?
-Hey, Sissy!

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,833
Where are you right now?
Are you busy?

181
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,291
I was about to go have
tea with Uiharu and Saten.

182
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,291
You're welcome to come
along if you'd like.

183
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,708
Well, the thing is,

184
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,541
I'm stuck helping
out this weird lady.

185
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,250
Weird? How so?

186
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,833
She started stripping off
her clothes without any warning?

187
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,375
She's stripping! It's the
Undresstress. It has to be!

188
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,125
Oh, no, Misaka!
Will you be okay?

189
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,625
Let go! Please!

190
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,666
Could you two try
to get it together?

191
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,625
Text me her picture,
okay? I want documentation!

192
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,291
Get a grip, you guys.

193
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,916
Don't go thinking she's
something from an urban legend.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,208
She might seem
a little odd,

195
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,875
but I'm sure she's
just an ordinary----

196
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,166
You said somebody is odd?

197
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,625
Is it me you're
talking about?

198
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,708
No. Of course not.

199
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,666
I mean, you did
take off your shirt.

200
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,458
Well ...

201
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,583
The number you have
dialed is unavailable.

202
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,541
Please leave a
message at the tone.

203
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,916
That seems a little bit
suspicious, don't you think?

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
Shouldn't we
track Misaka down

205
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,500
and make sure
that she's okay?

206
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,875
You're really taking this
urban legend seriously.

207
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,291
How incredibly childish.

208
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,958
To thank you for
keeping me company.

209
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,708
Oh, all right. Thank you.

210
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,208
Why something hot?

211
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,083
Especially curry soup?

212
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,041
Most people don't
realize this,

213
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,291
but when it's hot out,

214
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,958
a warm drink is
better for you.

215
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,208
Also, curry contains
special spices

216
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,833
that help to relieve fatigue
and rejuvenate the body.

217
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,666
I think I understand the
theory of what you're saying.

218
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,291
But, emotionally,
I find a cold drink

219
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,916
on a hot day more
satisfying, so ...

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,833
Emotionally? Huh.

221
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,125
I suppose when
you're younger,

222
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,583
emotions tend to
drive your decisions

223
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,583
more than practicality.

224
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,166
I'll get you something
else. What would you like?

225
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,541
Oh, no. Please, that's okay.
The sentiment is enough.

226
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,500
Sorry about that.

227
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,791
I tend to look at things
from a logical perspective

228
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,875
maybe because
of all the time

229
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,583
I spend doing research.

230
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,208
You do a lot of research?

231
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you some kind
of scientist, then?

232
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm a cerebrophysiologist.

233
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,125
My primary area of study
is AIM diffusion fields.

234
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,375
Diffusion fields.

235
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,625
Those are the weak
spheres of power

236
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,125
that Espers
continuously emit

237
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,541
without being
consciously aware of it?

238
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,041
That's right. You've already
learned about them in school?

239
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,291
Uh--huh. Back during
my first year.

240
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,500
They told us the
fields are so weak

241
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,500
they can't be detected
with human senses

242
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:43,000
and have to be measured
using specialized devices.

243
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,041
I'm especially interested
in discovering ways

244
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,375
to harness and
apply that power.

245
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,041
Oh, does that mean ...

246
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,416
Do you know a lot
about Esper abilities?

247
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,708
Are you interested in
something specific?

248
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,208
Well, yeah,

249
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:01,333
um ... Is it possible
that there's an ability

250
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,875
that can negate
other powers?

251
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,791
Well, there are so many
different abilities out there.

252
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,291
Can you give me a
clearer example of

253
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,791
what you're describing?

254
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,666
Let's say someone was hit
with an electric shock

255
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,000
and it had no effect.

256
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,208
An electric shock, huh?

257
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,791
Maybe this person
generated something

258
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,208
to act as a lightning rod

259
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,166
and deflected the
electrical current?

260
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,000
It's something
different than that.

261
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,291
I'm not really sure
how to explain it.

262
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,916
Is this person an
acquaintance of yours?

263
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,041
Oh! No!

264
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,625
It's an urban legend my
friends were talking about.

265
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,791
It's ridiculous. I shouldn't
have said anything.

266
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,750
An urban legend, huh?

267
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,000
Is that the
kind of thing

268
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,958
children are interested
in these days?

269
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,375
I know it sounds silly,

270
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,250
but there are quite a
few of them going around.

271
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,791
Y'know, like the
Undresstress?

272
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,333
Undresstress?

273
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,500
No, never mind. Forget
I even mentioned it!

274
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,625
Oh! I'm so sorry!

275
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,916
No, don't worry about it.

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,125
It'll wash off
easily enough.

277
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,416
Can't you keep
your clothes on?

278
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,875
Still no answer.

279
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,375
Why can't I get
a hold of her?

280
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,541
Probably 'cause the
Undresstress is attacking her!

281
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,083
I'm not listening
to that nonsense.

282
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,500
Look what I found.

283
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,666
This website has a ton of
detailed information on it.

284
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,416
And it's all about her.

285
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,666
Let me see.

286
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,625
What is it? What does it say?

287
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,958
It's terrible.

288
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,666
It says here the victims
of the Undresstress

289
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,125
may try to hold out,

290
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,500
but all eventually
utter a final cry

291
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,625
and are lost forever.

292
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,750
This gets more
absurd every second.

293
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,000
It's just a dumb story.

294
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,166
But, if you're
that worried,

295
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,541
remember that Sissy
is the ultimate,

296
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,458
unstoppable shock princess,
the Ace of Tokiwadai.

297
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,000
She's hardly going to be
undone by some strange woman

298
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,208
just because she likes
to undress in public.

299
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,750
That's not all.

300
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,166
I think something even
more terrifying

301
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,833
could be happening here.

302
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,250
Now what are you
going on about?

303
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,458
What if the Undresstress
is contagious somehow?

304
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,750
What? You mean
like a disease?

305
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,375
Maybe those who meet her
become cursed the way she is.

306
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,250
Maybe they become
Undresstresses, too!

307
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,541
Then Misaka will go around
stripping for everybody!

308
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,583
Oh, no. That can't happen.

309
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,041
Not to my Sissy!

310
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,083
No! Don't do it,
Sissy! You can't!

311
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,791
Um, Shirai?

312
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,583
Uiharu, you have to find
a way to lift the curse!

313
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,125
Right now!

314
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,541
Please, don't get so
worked up. You're hurting me!

315
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, remember?

316
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,208
It's nothing but an
urban legend, right?

317
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,666
Sorry for inconveniencing
you so much.

318
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,166
Well, I've already
come this far.

319
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,125
There you go.

320
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,458
Great. Thank you.

321
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,333
Oh, yes. Thank that young man
for me, too, won't you?

322
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,833
Young man?

323
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,000
He's a friend
of yours, right?

324
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,083
He could tell I
was in trouble

325
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,833
and asked what he
could do to help.

326
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,875
Oh, did he?

327
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,833
He's a good kid.

328
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,208
He's always butting in.

329
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,291
I think he just likes
to play the hero.

330
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,250
He barges into the
middle of a situation,

331
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,583
babbling random stuff,
and then disappears again.

332
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,416
It's annoying.

333
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,958
I don't know how
to describe it,

334
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,750
but something about him
rubs me the wrong way.

335
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,125
He's headstrong and naive.

336
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,083
It's like he stepped
out of a fairy tale.

337
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,083
He's always convinced
that he's...

338
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,083
He sounds like a fun guy.

339
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,583
So are you, you know,
in love with this kid?

340
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,000
What? You're crazy!

341
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,666
You know what I'm
talking about.

342
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,583
That thing where you
pretend to hate someone but,

343
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,083
really, you're
nuts about them?

344
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,041
What do they
call it again?

345
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,833
Let's see, here.

346
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,666
Ah, yes. Playing hard to get.

347
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,666
That's it.

348
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,458
That's impossible!

349
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,750
What's happening?
Why'd the alarm go off?

350
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,708
No time to ask questions.

351
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,083
Come on, let's go!

352
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,416
Move.

353
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,000
Thanks so much
for helping me.

354
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,125
Take care, okay?

355
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,333
'Kay. Drive safely!

356
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,041
Come to think of it, who forgets
where they parked their car?

357
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,041
There's definitely something
off about her, all right.

358
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,291
I'm exhausted.

359
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,875
It's not like I did
all that much today.

360
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,791
Why am I so worn out?

361
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,041
This is his fault.
He ruined my day.

362
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,291
Next time I see him
I swear I'll...

363
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,708
They all broke!

364
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,250
A week's worth of
breakfast, just gone!

365
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,083
This is awful.

366
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,166
I waited in line
for two hours!

367
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,041
I can't believe it! This
is why you ran away earlier?

368
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,958
You saddled me with some
crazy exhibitionist lady

369
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,291
so you could go shopping?

370
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,041
You know, for a student
as poor as I am,

371
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,375
getting groceries
while they're on sale

372
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,833
can be a matter
of life and death!

373
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,208
Not that somebody from
Tokiwadai would understand!

374
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,250
I didn't have an awesome
day either, thank you!

375
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,083
Her skirt got dirty,
so she stripped again,

376
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,791
and I had to wash it,
and after all that,

377
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,875
she told me
I was playing...

378
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,083
What?

379
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,041
Never mind.
Just forget about it.

380
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,916
You owe me a fight!

381
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,125
I don't get why you're so
eager for another fight.

382
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,416
You've lost every one
so far, haven't you?

383
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,791
Shut up!

384
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,666
I haven't been giving it
everything I've got yet,

385
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,375
so I haven't
lost anything.

386
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,875
Okay. How are we going
to resolve this?

387
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,791
Huh? Well, it's a
simple matter, really.

388
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,666
I just have
to beat you up.

389
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,666
Quit with the sighing,
already. It's irritating me!

390
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,291
All right, I give.

391
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,166
If it's the only thing
that will satisfy you.

392
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,041
I'm willing
to take you on.

393
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,708
Good. I'm glad you
finally came around.

394
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,166
We shouldn't bother
anybody if we fight down here.

395
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,166
I'm ready when you are.

396
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,541
So bring it on.

397
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,416
You don't have
to tell me twice.

398
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,625
I've been waiting a long
time for this opportunity.

399
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,500
All right, here we go!

400
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,625
Like I thought. Shocks
don't work on you.

401
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,166
Well, then ...

402
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,375
Huh? What's that thing?

403
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,833
Whoa! Hey, now.

404
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,666
Isn't it against the
rules to use weapons?

405
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,916
Not if I made it
using my ability.

406
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,958
The iron sand vibrates, making
it sort of like a chainsaw.

407
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,666
Fair warning, it might
hurt a bit if it touches you.

408
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,208
I'm really not
okay with this.

409
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,083
Do you think you could
put that thing away?

410
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,875
You can dodge and duck
and run all you want.

411
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,416
No matter how far you scamper,
I can still reach you!

412
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,750
It's longer!

413
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,500
Gotcha! Let's see
if you can dodge this!

414
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,083
He deflected the sand
particles back at me!

415
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,041
Oh, well. I
anticipated that, too.

416
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,166
Well, looks like
that's the match, huh?

417
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,458
Oh, no.

418
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,541
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

419
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,916
Uh--oh. Even in the wind
she can control it?

420
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,500
No matter how
many times you try

421
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,875
it's going to end the
same way it always has.

422
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,291
I've got you! You can
stop my currents in mid--air,

423
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,125
but...

424
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,833
My electricity!

425
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,708
It isn't even flowing!

426
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,958
How does this guy do it?

427
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,708
Uh ...

428
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,041
Yeah. I give up.
You're the winner.

429
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,250
Jerk! Don't screw with me!

430
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,375
Take this fight seriously!

431
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,416
I'm trying to help.
You looked really scared!

432
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,375
No I didn't.
You don't scare me!

433
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,083
Now you're lying!

434
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,833
Your eyes got all red
and watery like a baby.

435
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,958
Then you flinched.

436
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,750
Die!

437
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,875
Get back here!

438
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,750
Be careful! If that
had hit me directly,

439
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,500
it could have killed me!

440
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,250
You know full well it
wouldn't have hurt you!

441
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,791
Whether it would have
worked on me or not,

442
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,541
you've gotta be pretty
sick to send an attack

443
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,125
like that without
even hesitating.

444
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,750
I'll have you know
I've never used that much

445
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,041
of my power to attack
somebody before today!

446
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,208
Then why start now? Why me?

447
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,125
Quit running like a
little girl and face me!

448
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,083
Just leave me alone.
I didn't ask for this!

449
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,875
Hey, I'm back.

450
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,208
Huh? Kuroko isn't home yet?

451
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,583
I'm exhausted.

452
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,916
So, it's true then.

453
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,708
Kuroko? Where are you hiding?

454
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,666
You were stripping
off all your clothing.

455
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,333
Saten was right.

456
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,875
You really were cursed
by the Undresstress!

457
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,500
Here!

458
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,250
It's imperative that you put
these on your head immediately!

459
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,208
Geez. What's gotten
into you now?

460
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,375
This is the only way
to lift the evil curse.

461
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,125
The curse of the
vile Undresstress!

462
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,958
Undresstress,
I banish you!

463
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,458
Put those down! Have
you gone insane?

464
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:05,000
I banish you!

465
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,083
Curse, be gone!

466
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,500
So, she's the Level 5.

467
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,083
I've heard so
much about her.

468
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,291
What a fascinating
young girl.

469
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,500
I had fun today,
and as an added bonus,

470
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,833
I get to do the preview.

471
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,083
Let's see.

472
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,291
I think I'll
accompany the preview

473
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,333
with some tasteful
disrobing. Next time...

474
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,583
Don't you dare!
