1
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,958
Time to get out
of bed, Sissy...

2
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,125
The day has finally come!

3
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,583
Aren't you excited?

4
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,083
No, not exactly.

5
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,250
But it's your
moment to shine!

6
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,583
I know big,
important events

7
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,208
are pretty much an everyday
occurrence for you,

8
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,041
but today is extra special...

9
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,833
I'm not the only
one who thinks so...

10
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,875
The rest of the girls in
our dorm have been waiting

11
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,458
for this almost as
anxiously as I have.

12
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,166
My moment to shine, huh?

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,000
There must have been
any number of girls

14
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,166
who would've been
better suited

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,791
for something like
this than I am.

16
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,708
Aw... always modest...!

17
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,625
You shouldn't be.
If you ask a hundred people

18
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,875
who best represents
the pride of Tokiwadai,

19
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,166
every single one of them
would say your name.

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,000
Well... since it's all set,

21
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,750
it's too late
to back out now.

22
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,875
That's the attitude
I'm looking for...

23
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,000
Now, then...

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,125
Let's see about getting
you changed, shall we?

25
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,291
I can dress myself.
I don't need your help.

26
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,750
Let's get this over with.

27
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:38,833
[Music]

28
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,833
One day out of each year, the
Tokiwadai Girls' dormitories

29
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,666
open their doors
to the public...

30
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,791
This is a special
annual event.

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,125
It's our midsummer festival.

32
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,208
You have all invited
special guests,

33
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,083
and today they will
be allowed inside.

34
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,166
I expect you all
to behave in a way

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,291
that befits your status
as Tokiwadai dorm residents.

36
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,041
There will be no missteps!

37
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,458
I get that we want
to be hospitable...

38
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,541
but are these outfits
really necessary?

39
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,166
Welcome to our dorm...

40
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,500
Would you like a pamphlet
listing today's events?

41
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,000
You sure are cute...

42
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,500
Can I take a picture?

43
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,333
I'm afraid not, sorry...

44
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,666
We ask that within the
dorms there be no photography.

45
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,875
Yeah...! Work it...!
Work it!

46
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,958
No photography!

47
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,791
Yes!... Yes...! Yes...
Perfect!

48
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,375
What did I just say...?

49
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,833
Why are you taking pictures?

50
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,208
I am working in an
official capacity...

51
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,041
I'm the midsummer festival's
archivist this year.

52
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,166
Somebody needs
to take pictures...

53
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,958
Future classes will want to
look back on this festival.

54
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,000
But Sissy...
I have to say,

55
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,500
your outfit doesn't
photograph well

56
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,708
with those stupid
shorts underneath it...

57
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,291
Couldn't you put on something a
little nicer for the occasion?

58
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,541
Please tell me, Kuroko...

59
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,958
How exactly will sticking
a camera up my skirt

60
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,833
help future Tokiwadai classes

61
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,625
to "look back" on this
year's festival...? Huh?!

62
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,083
Now, now, Sissy.

63
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,166
I think we have a
misunderstanding here...

64
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,583
Hey, you guys!

65
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,041
You two are
always wrestling.

66
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,500
I can't thank you enough
for inviting us, Shirai...

67
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,708
What an honor...!

68
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,958
We're here for the exclusive

69
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,750
Tokiwadai Middle School
midsummer festival!

70
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,125
I can't wait...!

71
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,791
I'm certain
today's festivities

72
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,375
will exceed even my
wildest imaginations!

73
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,750
I'm glad you
could be here...

74
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,250
We won't disappoint...

75
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,458
The events to come
will be memorable...

76
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,166
I'm certain you'll enjoy
everything we have to offer.

77
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,458
Now then... shall I take
you on a little tour?

78
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,625
Just a minute.

79
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,000
Shirai... when were you
planning on helping us out

80
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,333
with the buffet?

81
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,666
Uh... I, uh, guess
I must have forgotten.

82
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,291
So...?

83
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,375
Oh, allow me to
introduce you...

84
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,166
This is Maika Tsuchimikado,

85
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,416
from Ryouran Girls'
Housekeeping School...

86
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,625
She and her classmates are
helping us out this year...

87
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,916
They're overseeing all
the food for the festival.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,375
Oh, I've heard
of that place!

89
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,333
They really specialize in
training future housekeepers?

90
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,416
Yes, they do.

91
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,375
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

92
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,208
Maika... These are two
very good friends of mine...

93
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,250
Kazari Uiharu and...
Ruiko Saten.

94
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,291
Hey, there.

95
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,041
It's so nice to meet you!

96
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,500
If there's
anything you need,

97
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,125
feel free to
give me a shout.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,416
And as for you...
time to work!

99
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,250
Hey...! Stop dragging me
for a second, will you...?

100
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,041
I can't just
abandon my friends.

101
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,416
Oh, but you can abandon
your work, is that it?

102
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,291
Now you're just
twisting my words.

103
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,500
I can show you around,
since she's busy.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
All right, then...

105
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,708
What should we start
with first...?

106
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,833
Is there anywhere
you'd like to...

107
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,375
Yes!...
Yes, yes, yes!

108
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,916
There is someplace I'd
like to see, very much!

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,166
Right here...
and here... and here...

110
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,333
Oh...! And from here
to down there, too.

111
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,500
Okay... everywhere, then?

112
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,541
I'll have you know...

113
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,833
For today, at least,

114
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,375
I am no longer mild--mannered
Kazari Uiharu...!

115
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,083
Yes, I hereby announce...

116
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,041
The arrival of my alter ego!

117
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,166
Well... that's fine...

118
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,833
We'll see everything
there is to see.

119
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,250
Wow!... What an
incredible display...!

120
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,541
That's what you get from
a top--notch school...

121
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,250
Well...? What
do you think?

122
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,000
Are all of these really
made entirely of sugar...?

123
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,416
It seems almost
impossible.

124
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,291
Let's see...

125
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,125
Yep, that's pure
sugar all right.

126
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,416
You can't just eat
that, you know...!

127
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,708
They're handcrafted
display models...!

128
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,833
Right... Misaka...?

129
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,291
Here, Misaka.

130
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,375
Have another, please.

131
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,708
It's really no trouble at all.

132
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,583
Oh... thanks...

133
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,833
It's lovely, really,
but I don't think so.

134
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:15,583
Wow... the detailing
on this is amazing.

135
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,250
Oh, hey, look at that!

136
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,041
We can even do
it ourselves!

137
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,875
Okay, Uiharu...
I'll give it a try.

138
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,125
You're going to come with us,
aren't you, Misaka?

139
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,833
Oh, well...
Thank you, but...

140
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,541
That settles it!
This'll be great...

141
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,333
Okay we've got a
party of three.

142
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,250
I think I did a
pretty decent job...

143
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,750
Here, take a look, Saten.

144
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,958
This one's not quite as
good as the one I made

145
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,458
for my brother's book--bag.

146
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,375
Oh, hey...
how's it coming?

147
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,875
Oh, wow...! These
are magnificent!

148
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,208
You can really tell that

149
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,583
these were arranged by
proper young ladies, huh?

150
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,041
They're all so
graceful and refined.

151
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,916
I think that's exactly the
impression they want to give...

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,958
This is a girls'
school, after all.

153
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,416
Excuse me, I
was wondering...

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,625
Did you arrange all the
flowers here by yourselves?

155
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,625
Yes, that's why we're
displaying them.

156
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,666
Oh...! They're
very beautiful.

157
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,750
Thanks for saying so...
We tried.

158
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,291
I have to say, the
flowers in your hair

159
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,208
are far prettier
than these are.

160
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,416
It's true.

161
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,750
You have an eye for
arrangements, clearly.

162
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,291
What are you talking about?

163
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,083
Tokiwadai is a fine
institution...

164
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,500
The festival is perfect.

165
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,791
I'm amazed...

166
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,666
Each exhibit is flawless...

167
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,791
Our school could never
aspire to this...

168
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,416
Tokiwadai has achieved
a greatness

169
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,458
that few places
could hope to match.

170
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,250
Well, Saten...?

171
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,500
Don't you agree?

172
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,416
You're awful! How could
you do that to me,

173
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,625
here of all places?!

174
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,250
Welcome back.

175
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,916
Well... you were
looking so dreamy,

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,333
I had to wake you up.

177
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,208
I wasn't dreaming,
thank you very much.

178
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,541
I'm wide awake!

179
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,333
Here. That should do it.

180
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,625
Thank you so very much...!

181
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,166
Oh... and please allow me to
wish you the very best of luck.

182
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,291
Yeah, well... thanks...

183
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,458
That's nice of you.

184
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,500
Lucky...! I can't believe
Misaka tied your apron for you.

185
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,166
Just look at her, Uiharu...

186
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,291
She's what Tokiwadai
is all about.

187
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah... that is so true.

188
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,791
So... are you guys
getting hungry?

189
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,291
That's it, I don't
ever want to leave!

190
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm just going to have
to move in with you.

191
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,458
I'll go look for
a seat, all right?

192
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,833
Oh... okay.

193
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,333
What's wrong...?
Oh, is it not cut yet?

194
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,208
Well. Allow me.

195
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,750
How could you do that to
such an exquisite cake?!

196
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,375
This from someone who
didn't think twice about

197
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,666
popping a sugar
statue in her mouth?

198
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,208
How can you possibly
eat that much cake?

199
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,791
People always say you
have a second stomach

200
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,000
for desserts, right?

201
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,666
I... I can't move...

202
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,916
That's what happens when you
eat twenty plates of food.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,250
But... it's good...

204
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,458
and they said it was
all you can eat...

205
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,750
Come on...

206
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,791
we can't let the students
see you in this state...

207
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,958
Move it...
Get up, get up!

208
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,916
If you're not careful,
it's all gonna come back up!

209
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,458
Big Sister Mikoto!

210
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,666
Huh...?
You're from Asunaro Park...

211
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,000
So, what are
you doing here?

212
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,958
I invited them
to come today.

213
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,625
Guess what?

214
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,750
We made rings out of
beads and drew pictures

215
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,000
and built stuff with sugar!

216
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,958
Wow... that sounds like fun.

217
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,333
Yeah, it was...!

218
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,708
But you want to know what
I'm most excited about...?

219
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,625
-Do you?
-Yes...

220
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,916
I would love to know.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,666
Seeing Big Sister
Mikoto on stage!

222
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,250
Me, too.
I can't wait!

223
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,916
Yeah, I hope it's not
gonna be much longer!

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,125
Okay, wait. Who told
you guys about that...?

225
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,958
It's not a big deal, really!

226
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,750
Yeah...! We're gonna
cheer for you...!

227
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,041
Good luck, Big Sister!

228
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,166
You heard her, right...?

229
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,833
You're going to give
them a show to remember.

230
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,958
Yes... Of course.

231
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,541
Now, now...
No running.

232
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,291
You might fall
and get hurt.

233
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,333
I mean...
Absolutely no running!

234
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,291
That's just great...

235
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,875
Does she think putting
extra pressure on me

236
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,208
is gonna make me
do any better?

237
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,916
Hey, Misaka!

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,875
Are you really gonna
perform something for us?

239
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,666
Huh?...
Oh, well, I...

240
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,541
Yeah...! Really...?

241
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,666
So how come you didn't say
anything about it earlier...?

242
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,250
Oh...! I get it!
It's gonna be a surprise!

243
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,958
Huh?...
No, no, no...

244
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,375
It isn't like that.

245
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,750
Don't worry about it...

246
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,083
We won't ask any
more questions.

247
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,500
But... Ah...! Quiet...!
Say no more...!

248
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,833
We'll just wait and see.

249
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, don't tell us...

250
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,666
I want it to be
a surprise...

251
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,916
Ah... what could it be?

252
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,625
I can't wait to find out!

253
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,750
Um... yeah...

254
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,208
Hey, Misaka!

255
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,625
Have you seen Shirai
around lately?

256
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,041
Didn't you
take her earlier

257
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,166
to help you out
with the buffet?

258
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,583
Yeah, but she's not in
the kitchen anymore...

259
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,666
The little brat must
have run away on me.

260
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,708
One of the guests here is
a freakishly big eater,

261
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,000
so we have our hands full

262
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,791
just getting enough
food on the table.

263
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,291
It's a big hassle.

264
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,000
Kuroko... she's so sneaky.

265
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,583
Oh, yeah...

266
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,125
Good luck today.

267
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,875
I can't wait to
see you up there!

268
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,291
So much suspense...!
Oh, my!

269
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,833
It's killing me!

270
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,291
Ah! That was one
delicious meal!

271
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,833
What's up next?
Where to?

272
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,291
Well, isn't it obvious?

273
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,208
No... Where?

274
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,083
Well, if we keep going
straight, we can...

275
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,083
Uh, sorry, guys.

276
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,458
I need to use the
restroom real quick...

277
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,166
Go on ahead without me.

278
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey... what's up with her...?

279
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,208
She's been acting kinda
nervous and twitchy.

280
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,333
Really? You think so?

281
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,750
Last call, everybody.

282
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,541
Do we have any
other bidders?

283
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,875
Saten, look...

284
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,250
Something's going
on out here.

285
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,833
I don't hear anybody...

286
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,916
Okay...! That makes
this our final bid!

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,041
Oh, that's cool...

288
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,791
They're having an auction.

289
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,500
Those are some incredibly
rare items up for bid...

290
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,375
I've seen some of that
stuff in a magazine.

291
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,375
It's so exclusive, you can't
even get it on the market.

292
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,125
Leave it to Tokiwadai!

293
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,875
Hey there, Konori!

294
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,958
Oh... what are
you doing here?

295
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,250
I had no idea you were
into purses that much.

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,958
Oh...! No... this isn't
my style normally.

297
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,625
They're doing it for
charity, though...

298
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,833
The proceeds they get from the
auction are being donated

299
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,833
to the Child
Error children...

300
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,166
As a member of Judgment,

301
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,250
it is expected for
me to participate.

302
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,458
You know...

303
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,541
that sounds suspiciously
like an excuse.

304
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,125
Well... it isn't.

305
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,250
Well, why don't you
guys bid on something?

306
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,375
No...

307
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,833
I don't think we can...

308
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,208
We can't afford it.

309
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,958
We don't have a whole
lot of spending money.

310
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,916
Oh, that's all right.

311
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,875
Let's see what we have now.

312
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,666
It's a lovely
stationery set.

313
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,291
We'll start the
bidding at one hundred!

314
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,250
200! 300! 400!

315
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,416
There, you see?

316
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,958
I guess you're right...

317
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,958
Okay. 10,000!

318
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,208
Why are you here...?

319
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,625
Tsuchimikado's been
looking all over for you.

320
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,375
This is the reason you abandoned
your duty in the kitchen...?

321
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,041
Just to drop a bunch of
money on some stationery?

322
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,416
Oh, no...

323
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,833
This isn't just a stationery
set, I'll have you know.

324
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,916
It is so very much more...

325
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,083
You see, it was put
up for auction

326
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,041
by none other than Sissy...

327
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,416
These pens and pencils...
these pages...

328
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,625
They are a part of her,
like bits of her soul.

329
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,250
I... am so... lucky!

330
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,958
Those belonged
to Misaka...

331
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,333
That explains it.

332
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,125
Speaking of which,
where is she...?

333
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,625
She's not with you?

334
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,208
Oh... well, you see...

335
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:20,333
Good afternoon, ladies.

336
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,500
Just perfect.
What are you doing here...?

337
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,541
And what's with that
outfit you've got on?

338
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,916
I should think that
would be obvious,

339
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,583
even to someone like you.

340
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,333
I felt certain you
would need coaching

341
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,791
on what it is to
be a proper maid,

342
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,250
so I condescended
to come and provide

343
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,500
the benefit of my
expert instruction...

344
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,083
I know...! I am so
generous of spirit.

345
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,416
So benevolent!

346
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,625
I cordially invite you

347
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,708
to study my impeccably
attired self...

348
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,041
This maid uniform is
authentically English...

349
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,125
With an Eastern flair,
of course...

350
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,333
It was designed
specifically for today.

351
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,458
There's nothing authentic
about that get--up.

352
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,708
All right then, Shirai...

353
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,208
Let's test your skill...

354
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,166
I want you to say,
"Welcome home, my lady."

355
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,666
Oh yeah?!
Why would I want to do

356
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,291
something like that?

357
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,958
You can't do it,
can you...?

358
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,666
Poor dear, even
with that outfit,

359
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,750
I can see you're hopeless.

360
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,083
I humbly beg your pardon...

361
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,541
I wonder if you would
be kind enough

362
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,083
to offer a demonstration?

363
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,583
I know so very little
about good manners, you see.

364
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,708
Oh, very well...

365
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,708
I am Mitsuko Kongo,
the Maid of Maids.

366
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,375
I will show you
how it is done.

367
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,166
Please, watch
me very closely.

368
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,708
First a little
twirl, and then...

369
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:20,750
Welcome home, my lady.

370
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,333
-It is so good to see you.
-Yes...

371
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,000
Now, my friends and
I are very thirsty.

372
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,875
Please bring drinks
for everybody.

373
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,541
Yes, of course, my lady.

374
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,541
Right away.

375
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,291
Thank goodness simple--minded
folk are so easy to handle.

376
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,208
Hey, guys.
Good to see you.

377
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,125
Yes, how have you been?

378
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,541
Probably a lot better
than you two ...

379
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,333
having to put up with
someone like her.

380
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,875
She can be
trying sometimes,

381
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,666
but she's not a
bad person, really.

382
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,916
Yeah, she's actually the one

383
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,041
who invited us to the
midsummer festival...

384
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,833
She's spent the whole
year waiting for it...

385
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:52,958
That's why we're here.

386
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,041
Wait... I'm confused now.

387
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,875
You guys don't all
live here in the dorm?

388
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,541
No, actually
Tokiwadai's girls

389
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,916
are split up between two
different dormitories...

390
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,583
There's this one,
of course,

391
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,416
and then there's also one
inside the Garden of Learning.

392
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,625
Wannai, Kongo, and I all
live in the other one.

393
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,541
You live in the
Garden of Learning...?!

394
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,250
That magical paradise filled
with elegant young ladies?

395
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,791
Anyway... is Misaka
around somewhere?

396
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,166
Come to think of it,

397
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,833
we haven't seen her since
she took a bathroom break.

398
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,625
Oh... That's too bad.

399
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,041
I wanted to tell
her how excited I am

400
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,041
about seeing her
perform today.

401
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,416
Do you know what kind of
performance Misaka's giving?

402
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,625
No, we have no idea.

403
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,916
It's a surprise!

404
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,666
Ooh... I wonder what it is?

405
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,250
Oh! That's right!

406
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,583
This is no time for me to
be hanging around here.

407
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,833
I have to get a good seat

408
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,000
so I can capture Sissy's
performance on camera!

409
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,458
I wish they would
stop being so excited.

410
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,791
Oh, no...

411
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,250
I'm breaking
out in a sweat!

412
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,666
Do I have the jitters...?

413
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,958
No. No way...

414
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,083
That can't be happening
to me of all people.

415
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,875
I wonder what kind of
surprise she has in store

416
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,166
for her performance.

417
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,708
I can't wait to find out.

418
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,166
Oh, dear...

419
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,541
My heart's
starting to pound,

420
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,333
and I've got butterflies
in my stomach!

421
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,541
Why are you nervous?

422
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,875
It's not your show.

423
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,416
You guys are close, Shirai.

424
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,333
Do you know what Misaka's
going to do up there?

425
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,375
Of course I do.

426
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,125
However... my lips
are firmly sealed.

427
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,875
S--E--A--L--E--D!

428
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,416
Lovely!

429
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,458
Look at the flowers!

430
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,083
I can barely walk.

431
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,666
Oh, no...

432
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,208
My heart's going a
million miles an hour.

433
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,250
Ah...! You've got to
get it together, now!

434
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,458
Um... Hey...

435
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,500
Sorry if I'm interrupting...

436
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,375
It's just... I got separated
from the person I came with.

437
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,208
Maybe you've seen
her around...?

438
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,083
She's about this tall,
and she's wearing a nun's habit.

439
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,458
What are you doing here?

440
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,125
I said, what are you doing here?
Answer me!

441
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,916
Whoa... I'm sorry...!

442
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,166
Uh... I'm not doing
anything wrong...

443
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,250
See, I have an invitation
and everything.

444
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,125
Did you come here to
make fun of me...?

445
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,958
You wanted to laugh
at my silly dress?

446
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,000
No... No way...

447
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,333
I think it looks really
pretty, actual...

448
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,583
Get outta here!

449
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,708
What is with that guy?

450
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,708
He chooses now of
all times to show up?

451
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,458
I'm already enough on edge!

452
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,583
Oh, cool. She's
doing a violin solo!

453
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,666
Oh, wow...! I didn't even
know that she could play.

454
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,500
Look at that.

455
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,208
They have no
idea I'm nervous.

456
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,708
All right, then.

457
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,250
What do you know.

458
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,875
It looks like that guy is
good for something, after all...

459
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,500
I didn't see that coming.

460
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:37,833
[Music]

461
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,708
Hey! Do you feel
that swaying...?

462
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,791
Back and forth...

463
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,541
Now, Sissy,
you know I'm steadfast.

464
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,708
I would never waver in
the face of your lov--

465
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,791
I'm talking about
an earthquake!
