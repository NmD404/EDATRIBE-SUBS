1
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,083
Uiharu!

2
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,583
Uiharu!

3
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Saten, are you all right?

4
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,083
That was a close call.

5
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:10,708
Are you injured...?

6
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,666
You're safe now.

7
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,958
I know that lady!

8
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:22,791
[Music]

9
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,333
Right... No one
was injured.

10
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,041
And, of course, we need to
make an official announcement

11
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,958
to keep any panic
from spreading.

12
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,291
As we know...

13
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,583
what happened wasn't the
result of an earthquake.

14
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,416
It was poltergeisting.

15
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,750
Yes... You're correct
about that, girls.

16
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,083
Bye.

17
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,166
I wanted to thank
you personally...

18
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,041
for saving my
friends back there.

19
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,416
I'm just relieved that
nobody was injured.

20
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,541
I was wondering something.

21
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,916
Are your people measuring
the AIM diffusion field

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,458
around this area?

23
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,208
Is MAR able to detect
abnormalities in the field

24
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,708
before an event happens?

25
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,958
I... well... um...

26
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,916
I mean, you arrived so
quickly on the scene.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,166
Could you tell
me your name?

28
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,083
Yes... I'm Kuroko Shirai,

29
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,791
of Tokiwadai and Judgment
Branch One-- seven--seven.

30
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,166
That explains it.

31
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,583
It seems your
branch in particular

32
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,541
has some outstanding
officers working for it.

33
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,625
There is a connection

34
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,666
between AIM diffusion
fields and RSPK.

35
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,833
It's impressive that
you've already found it.

36
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,250
From what we can tell,
the RSPK incidents

37
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,916
are being caused by
someone tampering

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,750
with AIM diffusion fields,

39
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,000
and these
synchronized events

40
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,708
are leading to the
poltergeisting we've seen.

41
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,291
It would have been helpful

42
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,416
if you'd mentioned this at
the joint conference earlier,

43
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,166
that way I would have
known to be on the lookout

44
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,583
for any suspicious persons
in the area at the time.

45
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,083
That's under Antiskill's
jurisdiction.

46
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,666
I thought I was
clear before.

47
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,166
We want Judgment to focus
on countering rumors

48
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,875
and managing matters
of day--to--day safety

49
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,333
within the city.

50
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,458
Tampering with AIM
diffusion fields.

51
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,333
We know somebody who
has done just that.

52
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,416
Could this be
her work, also?

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,333
Whose work?

54
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,750
Misaka!

55
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,333
We're going to ride along to
the hospital with Haru'ue.

56
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,541
Oh... we'll come, too.

57
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,541
Unfortunately,
we can't do that.

58
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,583
The head resident will
be doing room check.

59
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,750
What a relief.

60
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,333
Thanks for
letting us know.

61
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,125
Goodnight.

62
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,791
She's gonna be fine.

63
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,916
They've all made it
safely back to the dorm.

64
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,083
So... Tell me, Sissy.

65
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,083
What has captured your
attention so completely?

66
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,166
The Level Upper fiasco?

67
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,541
Why are you
looking at that?

68
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,333
It's just a hunch I have.

69
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,875
There's something about
the current situation

70
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,583
that reminds me of it.

71
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,791
The manipulation of
AIM diffusion fields

72
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,708
was a big part of that
incident as well.

73
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,208
What's more...

74
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm still not going to be
choosy about my methods.

75
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,208
If you don't like the
plan I come up with,

76
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,458
you'll have to come
and stop me again.

77
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,250
I see what you mean.

78
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,208
You're thinking that
Kiyama might be involved

79
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,583
in the recent spate
of poltergeisting.

80
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,291
I understand why,

81
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,208
but aren't you forgetting
one important detail?

82
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,250
The woman in question
is currently a resident

83
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,208
of the detention center in
School District Seventeen.

84
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,791
There's no way a high--profile
criminal like Kiyama

85
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,416
would be able to
get out of there.

86
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,958
Yeah, you're
probably right.

87
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,541
There is something
else about all this

88
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,000
-that concerns me, though.
-Yeah?

89
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,041
The way Haru'ue was behaving
at the fireworks show.

90
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,000
Where...?

91
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,125
Where are you...?

92
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,250
Please, where?

93
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,291
Yeah, you're right.

94
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,166
It's kind of like she
was talking to somebody

95
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,666
who wasn't even there.

96
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,125
All right, let's think
through the situation.

97
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,541
We know this is the result

98
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,250
of someone tampering
with AIM fields.

99
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,958
Which means it has to
be the work of an esper.

100
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,458
Wait, you aren't saying...

101
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,666
I know... It's a horrible
thing to think about.

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,916
I'll comfort you, Sissy!

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,250
Get off me!

104
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,125
How could something like
that even be possible?

105
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,958
Haru'ue only
recently transferred

106
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,208
into our school district,
remember...? Although.

107
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,250
You're from District
Nineteen, right, Haru'ue?

108
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,583
Weren't there several
poltergeisting outbreaks

109
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,666
in that area?

110
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,000
What was it like?

111
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,625
I think Saten's
onto something.

112
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,625
Poltergeisting incidents
in District Nineteen

113
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,958
have stopped completely
for a short while.

114
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,291
And, in the meantime...

115
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,625
here in District Seven.

116
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,416
That's a coincidence...!

117
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,291
You really think a
sweet little girl like her

118
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,208
could have anything
to do with this?

119
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,708
You're right.
There's no way.

120
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,250
It's my Judgment training

121
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,666
making me suspicious
of everybody.

122
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,083
It's just, after that
call from Konori, I...

123
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:55,958
Uh...

124
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,333
Hello, Konori.

125
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,416
I hope I'm not
disturbing you...

126
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,625
Oh, Shirai?!

127
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,000
-Are you okay...?
-Yes.

128
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,541
Why didn't you call
and tell me...?

129
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,625
You're always doing
stuff like this!

130
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,708
'Night, Konori!

131
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,916
I'm glad she's sleeping.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
I'm sorry you had to
come all the way here

133
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,125
after the hospital.

134
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,416
Oh, please, don't
worry about it.

135
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,708
It's not like any of this
is your fault, you know.

136
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,083
Besides, if she's
your roommate,

137
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,291
that makes her
my friend, too.

138
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,208
It seems like I have
to keep coming to you

139
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,458
for help over and over
again today, huh?

140
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,791
Well, that's nothing new.

141
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,583
I am a little worried
about her, though.

142
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,000
You know what I mean...?

143
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,791
She still doesn't
remember anything at all

144
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,041
about the earthquake.

145
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,791
Yes. I think she's in
a mild state of shock.

146
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,583
That's what the doctor
at the hospital said,

147
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,583
and it seems to be true.

148
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,041
It was pretty scary, huh?

149
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,166
Yeah.

150
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,750
Well, at least the
fireworks show was awesome...

151
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,791
and nobody got badly hurt.

152
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,458
Now... you take excellent
care of Haru'ue, you hear me?

153
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,250
Yep, you just
leave it to me!

154
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,916
Oh... one more thing.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,750
Thanks for all
your help tonight.

156
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,333
Oh... I didn't
know you were up.

157
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,416
What? Where am I?

158
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,916
Back in our dorm room...

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,333
How are you feeling?

160
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,000
Can I get you something
to drink or anything?

161
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:28,208
I'm sorry. I hope I wasn't
too much trouble tonight.

162
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,041
No trouble at all,
I promise you.

163
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,375
I'm strange.
I know that.

164
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,791
Now other people know, too,

165
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,041
and they don't
like me anymore.

166
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,291
That's not
going to happen!

167
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,000
For one thing...
you've got me

168
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,625
and I still like
you just fine.

169
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,750
Oh I can't believe
I almost forgot!

170
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,541
Saten brought you a get--well
treat to cheer you up.

171
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,875
Hold on just a second.

172
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,291
It's delicious.

173
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,750
Apparently, this came
from outside the city.

174
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,958
Saten says the ones we
have here are too bland,

175
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,041
and she wanted you
to have the best!

176
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,666
She's really nice.

177
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,833
Both you and Saten and
the others... all of you.

178
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,333
You've helped me so much.

179
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,708
I can't do anything.

180
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,208
All I'm good
at is waiting.

181
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,958
I hate being like this,
but it's true.

182
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,708
I wish I could change.

183
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,416
Don't give up.

184
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,208
You can change.

185
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,208
I would never have become
a Judgment officer

186
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,458
without all my
friends helping me.

187
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,791
We're on your side now.

188
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,458
We're going to help you.

189
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,041
So you'll be just fine.

190
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,291
Really? You think I can change?

191
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,208
Of course. In fact,
I guarantee it.

192
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,250
Now, eat your watermelon.

193
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,833
It'll make you feel better.

194
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,750
You're at Nature Park?

195
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,333
Together with Haru'ue?

196
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,708
That isn't fair!

197
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,250
Why didn't you invite me
to come along with you?

198
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,750
I didn't even know you were
off Judgment duty already.

199
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,125
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,583
I thought...
breathing fresh air...

201
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,333
would be nice,
for a change.

202
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,583
Have you overdosed
on fresh air?

203
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,000
You're way out of breath.

204
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,750
I'm fine, really.

205
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,333
A... okay.

206
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,666
Just dandy.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,208
Aw.

208
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,458
I dropped by to
hang out with her,

209
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,958
and she's blowing me off.

210
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,250
Well, this isn't
exactly a place

211
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,625
where people
come to hang out.

212
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,875
I'm sorry about that.

213
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,375
I know...!
Why don't I go out

214
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,250
and get some snacks
for us to share?

215
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,375
A snack would be nice.

216
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,041
How about some ramen, some
fried rice, a seafood sampler

217
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,541
and let's see,
what else sounds good.?

218
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,708
You're hungry, huh?

219
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,416
Oh, and how about some
spring rolls, too.

220
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,916
You know, the kind
with shrimp in them.

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,166
Uh, you do know I'm not
paying for all this, right?

222
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,500
You know, I don't
feel good about this.

223
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,708
Yeah.

224
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,166
Same here...
but we have to do it

225
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,375
if we want to clear
Haru'ue's name, right...?

226
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,125
-There's no choice.
-Yeah, okay.

227
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,333
There she is.

228
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,041
It looks like her
ability is telepathy.

229
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,750
Psychological
responsiveness.

230
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,291
But she's still a Level 2.

231
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,625
Which basically means she
can't utilize it at all.

232
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,208
There, you see...!

233
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,416
Haru'ue doesn't have anything
to do with the poltergeisting...

234
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,875
I knew we were
getting ourselves

235
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,250
all worked up about nothing.

236
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,625
Wait, Sissy...

237
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,958
Look at this.

238
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,958
Ah! That breeze feels so good!

239
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,166
Have you noticed food tastes
better when you eat outside?

240
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,958
I guess that's why people
like going on picnics.

241
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,625
Um... about the other night.

242
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,208
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said.

243
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,750
How you told me I could
change if I wanted to

244
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,750
and how you'd be there
to help me if I tried.

245
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,083
Well, I've made
a decision.

246
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,916
I want... I want
to change, really.

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,208
That's a big
choice to make.

248
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes, but I think
it's the right one.

249
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,041
And there's something
else I want to tell you.

250
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,500
You see, I...

251
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,458
I'm looking for a friend.

252
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,708
We were friends
for a long time...

253
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,166
always by each
other's side.

254
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,500
But then one day...

255
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,000
we got split up.

256
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,375
She made me promise that
someday, no matter what...

257
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,333
we'd meet up again.

258
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,000
All this time...
I've been waiting.

259
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,750
But I've made
up my mind.

260
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,625
Waiting isn't good
enough anymore.

261
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,541
I need to actually
start looking for her.

262
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,958
I'm here.... but who
knows where she is?

263
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,250
Okay, Haru'ue, we'll look
for your friend together.

264
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,750
And I'm sure
we'll find her.

265
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,500
Don't you worry!

266
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,000
Thank you so much.

267
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,083
What is it?
What are you doing?

268
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,791
I can't find you.
Where are you?

269
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,166
Why are you hurting?

270
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,666
Please, listen to me!

271
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,875
-What's going on?
-Where are you...?

272
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,500
-Haru'ue!
-Where are you?

273
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,625
What the...?!

274
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,250
Not again!

275
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,000
What's that beeping?

276
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,625
No, I'm telling you,
it's better than you think.

277
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,791
I'll get some for us.

278
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,958
A large--scale
poltergeist event!

279
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,916
Out in Nature Park?

280
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,750
That's where Uiharu
and Haru'ue are!

281
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,375
What's the casualty count?

282
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,708
72 people injured...
eighteen of them seriously...

283
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,916
No fatalities as of yet.

284
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,875
Continue with the
rescue operation.

285
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:15,875
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,666
It's true. You really
couldn't distinguish this

287
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,000
from the aftermath of
an actual earthquake.

288
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,625
Please just come with me.

289
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,666
It's okay.
You can let me go.

290
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,333
I'm a Judgment officer.

291
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,625
Please, just let me see
what I can do to help out.

292
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,083
It's you.

293
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,791
You were at the last one.

294
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,416
Miss Therestina?
You're here?

295
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Uiharu!

296
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,875
Hi, guys.

297
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,750
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

298
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,375
Sorry you came
down here.

299
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,166
As you can see, I'm fine.

300
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,541
It's just a little
scrape, that's all.

301
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,833
I told them it
wasn't a big deal,

302
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,541
but they still insisted.

303
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,583
I'm glad you're okay.

304
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,666
You could have called...

305
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,083
We were worried about you!

306
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,708
You got caught in
poltergeisting events

307
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,166
two times in a row!

308
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,916
You and Haru'ue must be
the unluckiest people

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,875
in Academy City!

310
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,416
Now that I think about it,
where is Haru'ue?

311
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,208
She was evacuated
before me,

312
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,208
so she must be around
here somewhere.

313
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,750
It's okay, though,
she' not hurt...

314
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,916
She just passed out.

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,208
That's a relief.

316
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,083
It could've been a
lot worse than that.

317
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,791
Uiharu.

318
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,000
Think back to right
before it happened.

319
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,583
Do you remember Haru'ue
behaving strangely in any way?

320
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,833
You know, like what
happened to her

321
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,583
during the fireworks show.

322
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,166
Well, uh...
why are you asking?

323
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,083
According to my
investigation.

324
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,958
Haru'ue is a Level
Two telepath

325
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,125
with some irregularities
in her ability.

326
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,416
If you observed any
suspicious behavior,

327
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,625
like what happened before,
then you need to tell me...

328
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,916
Why?

329
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,583
Huh?

330
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,708
Why would you be
investigating Haru'ue?

331
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,791
Oh, well, you see...

332
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,291
No way.

333
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,416
You can't suspect Haru'ue
of being involved in this.

334
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,750
Well. Suspect is
a strong word.

335
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,958
How could you do this,
Shirai?

336
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,291
Haru'ue just transferred
to our District.

337
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,083
She's nervous, and she's
relying on us to help her...

338
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,541
and yet, you....

339
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,458
-You're horrible!
-Whoa, take it easy, Uiharu.

340
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,958
Listen, to her, Uiharu.
Kuroko didn't mean t...

341
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,208
It's certainly possible

342
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,041
that a telepath is
the one tampering

343
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,833
with the AIM diffusion fields.

344
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:11,916
We can't write it off.

345
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,541
Oh, I didn't
see you there.

346
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,791
It doesn't look like they
can take any more here.

347
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,416
Have the rest of the
injured sent to the hospital

348
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,666
in District Fifteen.

349
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,250
Right.

350
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,166
-What now?
-As I was saying.

351
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,041
A telepath could
indeed be responsible,

352
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,125
but they would have to be
a Level Four at least

353
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,708
and the number of people
who fit that description

354
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,208
is very small.

355
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,125
The chance of a Level Two
managing such a feat

356
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,833
is practically zero.

357
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,333
But I still think we
should look into this,

358
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,416
just to be on
the safe side.

359
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,833
Who is this
friend of yours?

360
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,750
A transfer student:
Erii Haru'ue

361
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,166
How could you?!

362
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,625
We're sending one victim
to the lab at headquarters.

363
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,666
-Have a car brought around.
-Please, no!

364
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,750
Just think of this as
proving her innocence.

365
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,416
It will be all right.

366
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,583
We have an excellent staff
of specialists at the lab.

367
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,208
She's in good hands.

368
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,125
And, you know, you shouldn't
shout in a hospital.

369
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,083
Here, have a drink.

370
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,041
No thanks,
I'm not thirsty.

371
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,041
Take it already.

372
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,708
Oh, hey...
is that watermelon tea?

373
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,041
That's perfect!

374
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,083
I'm dying of thirst over
here. Thanks a lot...!

375
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,583
Have one, Kuroko.

376
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,291
The exam is complete.

377
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,458
Is it...? Great...!
Where is she?

378
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,916
Please calm yourself.

379
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It will still be a little
while before we get the results.

380
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,333
Now. Follow me.

381
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,958
Wow.

382
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,458
This doesn't really look much
like a laboratory, does it...?

383
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,458
It's not decorated
like one, anyway.

384
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,000
In this job you see a lot
of pain and suffering.

385
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,666
It's nice to remember
there are still pure,

386
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,041
beautiful things
in the world.

387
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,958
Huh...? You mean,
this stuff is all you?

388
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,083
Sure... I was the decorator.

389
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,875
All right. Shall we
have some introductions?

390
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:20,708
I'm Therestina, director of the
Multi Active Rescue Laboratory.

391
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,791
-The director?!
-The director?!

392
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,375
Do I have this right?

393
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,250
You're the commander of
the Multi Active Rescue team,

394
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,708
the director of
the entire lab.

395
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,416
I think that's it.

396
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,458
Or do you have more titles?

397
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,666
No, that's all.

398
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,125
And what about you?

399
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,416
Except for Shirai there,

400
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,125
I don't know any
of your names.

401
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,333
Tell me who you are.

402
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,958
Oh right, sorry.
My name's Mikoto Misaka.

403
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,750
From Tokiwadai Girls' school?

404
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,208
What an unexpected honor

405
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,500
to have the famous Railgun
here in my own lab.

406
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,333
No... really....

407
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,750
-And...
-Oh... I'm Ruiko Saten. Uh. Hi.

408
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,583
Are you at Tokiwadai, too?

409
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,333
No, I'm at Sakugawa.

410
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,416
If you're friends with
somebody like Misaka,

411
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,541
you must be quite an
esper in your own right.

412
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,958
No... actually...

413
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,458
I'm not.

414
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,583
Well, no matter...

415
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,833
Nice to meet you.

416
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,875
Oh... it's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

417
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,750
-And you are?
-Kazari Uiharu

418
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,333
officer with Judgment
Branch One--Seven--Seven.

419
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,166
I see...

420
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,541
So you and Shirai are...

421
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,500
Please! Haru'ue's not the
person you're looking for.

422
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,541
She's not some
kind of criminal!

423
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,625
Let's try something.

424
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,083
Tell me, what's
your favorite color?

425
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,958
I like all
colors, really...

426
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,916
If I have to pick,
I guess yellow.

427
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,250
Yellow, is it?

428
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,708
Well... we shall see.

429
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,416
What are you
doing, exactly?

430
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,416
There.

431
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,291
I'd say that's a good sign.

432
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,333
Huh?

433
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,583
Excuse me!

434
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,375
You would dare
to assault me?

435
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,125
You do know that I am
Mitsuko Kongo of Tokiwadai?

436
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,666
There's no assault.

437
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,000
Please, just listen...

438
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,541
As we've been
trying to explain,

439
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,791
cases of poltergeisting among
Level Fours are quite rare,

440
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,041
so further examination...

441
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,333
And as I've explained,
no exam is necessary.

442
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,125
There is absolutely
nothing wrong with me...

443
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,916
Ecaterina is waiting, so...

444
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,125
That's Shirai.

445
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,583
Shirai, Misaka,
can you hear me?

446
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,958
Quick, hold her down!

447
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,333
-Wait, what are you...
-Is something the matter?

448
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,041
No... it's nothing.

449
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,458
That's Haru'ue!

450
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,250
-Results in?
-Yes.

451
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,500
Let's see here.

452
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,708
Well? What is it?

453
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,625
You can relax now.

454
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,750
She isn't the person
we're looking for.

455
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,041
You were right about her.

456
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,666
She is a Level
Two telepath.

457
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,166
What's more,
she's only a receiver

458
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,875
and unable to send out
any messages herself.

459
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,041
But what about the note in
her record in the database

460
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,416
saying she exhibited
"anomalistic ability

461
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,750
above her level under
specific wavelengths?"

462
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,833
Be quiet!
Let it go!

463
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,875
Our examination
was quite thorough.

464
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,083
We found that she is limited
to a select number of partners.

465
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,333
She can pick up on those people
regardless of the distance

466
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,791
or any obstacles
in the way,

467
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,750
but she can't
hear anybody else.

468
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,416
Whatever the case.

469
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,666
It simply isn't possible for
her to tamper with AIM fields.

470
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,791
You see? Told you.

471
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,625
I was only doing my job.

472
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,750
So... If it's not her,

473
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,083
then who is the one
behind the poltergeisting?

474
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,875
Hi, Haru'ue.

475
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,083
Oh... Uiharu...

476
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,375
I guess I passed out again.

477
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,708
It's okay.

478
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,166
Everything's okay.

479
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,500
You don't have anything
to worry about now!

480
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,583
Here.

481
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,208
This pendant is important
to you, isn't it?

482
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,541
Yes... it's a memento
of a good friend.

483
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,708
You mean the
one you told me

484
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,250
you were looking
for earlier?

485
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,500
Yes, that's right.

486
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,625
I can hear her.

487
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,750
Like her voice?

488
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,791
That sounds like
telepathy to me.

489
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,833
It's only once in a while.

490
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,458
But when I do hear it.

491
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,708
I get lost in it somehow.

492
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,125
So that's what
those attacks are.

493
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,208
Is there a photograph
inside the pendant?

494
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,291
Yes.

495
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,541
See. Her name's Banri Edasaki.

496
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,666
It's that girl!

497
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,416
I've seen her before.

498
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,750
You know who Banri is?

499
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,833
Well, I...

500
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,916
There's something else.

501
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm like her.

502
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,333
I'm a Child Error, too.

503
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:37,208
[Music]

504
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,541
So, Haru'ue is a Child Error.

505
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,666
Kuroko and Uiharu aren't
exactly on the best of terms.

506
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,500
I guess it's up to me to--

507
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,833
Wait! You again?!
