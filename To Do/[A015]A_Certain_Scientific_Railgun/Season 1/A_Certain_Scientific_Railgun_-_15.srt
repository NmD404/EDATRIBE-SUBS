1
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,625
Who do you think you are?

2
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,166
Trying to assault me...?

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,833
You should know that
I am Mitsuko Kongo

4
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,250
of Tokiwadai Middle School.

5
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,125
"Assault" you?

6
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,666
One of Tokiwadai's darlings

7
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,500
would bust out the fancy words
instead of talking normal...

8
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,750
Huh?

9
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,166
How sad that you have such a
feeble grasp of the language...

10
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,208
Well, I'll be happy to
teach you a thing or two.

11
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:04,958
Aw, what's wrong...?

12
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,750
Does the little girl
have a headache?

13
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,083
What's happening?

14
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,083
-Hurts, doesn't it?
-Who are you?

15
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,708
Hey, now...

16
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,500
picking on young
girls, are we?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,916
Well, we can't have that.

18
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,375
Who's... there...?

19
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,875
Maybe this marks the end

20
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,291
of the recent outbreak
of esper hunts

21
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,166
conducted by Skill Out.

22
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,458
Though that could be
too much to hope for.

23
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,416
Going after somebody like
Kongo was a gutsy move...

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,083
No matter how many
of them ganged up,

25
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,208
Level Zeroes wouldn't be a
match for a Level Four esper...

26
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,375
I guess they learned that
lesson the hard way...

27
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,833
Unless they're stupider
than they look, of course.

28
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,416
That isn't how
it happened.

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,416
It's all in
Kongo's report...

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,541
For some reason, she wasn't able
to use her esper ability...

31
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:04,333
Fortunately, some stranger
appeared and helped her.

32
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,541
Tamezo?

33
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,916
What? Is something wrong?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,125
Huh...? Sorry...

35
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,500
Let's see...

36
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,833
Maybe Uiharu's questioning
will produce something.

37
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,291
Yes.

38
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,916
And after that, I don't
know what happened.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,250
I just passed out.

40
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,416
And when you
came to again,

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,333
your attackers were
all on the ground?

42
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,708
Yeah.

43
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,250
Can you remember anything
else about what happened?

44
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, maybe...

45
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,125
I don't know what
they're called, exactly...

46
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,208
It's a particular
kind of garment...

47
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,041
Something you would
generally see on men

48
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,625
who ride motorcycles
and the like.

49
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,333
A leather jacket?

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,666
Yes...! That's what it was!

51
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,375
A black leather jacket...!

52
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,250
And the gentleman
who was carrying it

53
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,208
had what looked like a
large black spider tattooed

54
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,458
on his back.

55
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,333
Are you sure
you're okay...?

56
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,125
You seem sort of
distracted...

57
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,791
If there's something
wrong, just tell me.

58
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,666
Oh, no...
it's nothing.

59
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,583
So, we have a man
with a leather jacket

60
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,833
and a black spider tattoo...

61
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,083
Could he be the one who
beat all these punks up?

62
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:10,916
[Music]

63
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,541
Big Spider?

64
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,000
That's the name
of the group

65
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,750
that's been carrying out
all these esper hunts?

66
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,666
Who are they, exactly?

67
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,000
Big Spider has always been a
fairly well--known organization,

68
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,208
even within the
members of Skill Out.

69
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,791
At one time, they had
their own sense of pride...

70
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,708
They knew where
the line was.

71
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,875
But they've degenerated

72
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,625
into little more than
a band of outlaws.

73
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,166
I know you claim
that these people

74
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,541
had some sense of pride...

75
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,000
But they sound
like a bitter mob,

76
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,750
sulking at the
rest of the world.

77
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,166
Maybe... but still...

78
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,458
Despite all the
indignation they felt...

79
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,750
and the anger...

80
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,750
They maintained a sort
of admiration for espers.

81
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,708
It sounds like you really
know a lot about them.

82
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,333
Yeah... I guess so.

83
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,166
You've done your research!

84
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,083
Somebody attacked Kongo?

85
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,208
Calm down now...

86
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,083
you should just
take it easy, Sissy.

87
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,791
Those guys are disgusting!

88
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,375
Ganging up and attacking
a girl like that! Come on!

89
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,250
You, uh... seem pretty worked
up about this, Misaka.

90
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,166
I just don't have any
patience for people

91
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,208
who would rather
hurt others

92
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,083
instead of facing
their own reality.

93
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,666
If you want my opinion,
it's both futile and cruel.

94
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,000
It's beginning to sound like
you're talking about me now.

95
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,541
What...? You're nothing
like that, Saten.

96
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,666
Yes, she's right...

97
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,000
You're not like them...

98
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,333
Skill Out only act when
they can do so as a gang.

99
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,500
It takes a lot more guts
to act on your own,

100
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,583
like you did when you were
so desperate to level up.

101
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,333
Shirai... I know
you mean well,

102
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,083
but I don't think
you're helping here.

103
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,791
I thought that Skill Out

104
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,416
was made up of a bunch
of Level Zero runaways...

105
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,958
Why would they be going
after espers like this?

106
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,375
It's a numbers game...

107
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,333
No matter how
brilliant an esper is,

108
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,083
it'll still be difficult for him
or her to face a large group.

109
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,083
What's worse...
We've received information

110
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,625
that this Big Spider
organization

111
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,541
has gotten its hands
on illegal weapons

112
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,208
using black
market channels.

113
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,666
I think maybe these guys
would feel differently

114
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,000
after tangling with me.

115
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,125
Now, now, Sissy.

116
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,250
You know if you want
somebody to tangle with,

117
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,583
you don't have to look
any further than right here.

118
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,208
That's not what I meant!

119
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,041
You are a seriously disturbed
person, do you know that?

120
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,833
So... How'd it all go down?

121
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,000
Those Skill Out people

122
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,458
who attacked Kongo
were caught, right?

123
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,000
But who was responsible?

124
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,791
Apparently some
mystery man showed up

125
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,000
and took them all out.

126
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,458
Wow...! A mysterious
champion of justice!

127
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,958
Champion? Please!

128
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,833
Members of Judgment
and Antiskill

129
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,250
are the only people who should
be involved in fighting crime.

130
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,500
This person is nothing
more than a vigilante!

131
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,666
It's not you.

132
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,000
It can't be you, right?

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,791
-Kurozuma...
-Yeah?

134
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,458
Here's the thing...

135
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,416
The guy who took
out Tamezo...

136
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,125
You think you
can lie to me?

137
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,750
I know what I heard.

138
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,000
No way... we all
know he's dead...

139
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,291
He didn't suddenly
come back to life.

140
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,750
Hey, listen up!

141
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,291
Tell me what my name is!

142
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,625
Wataru Kurozuma!

143
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,750
That's right...

144
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,041
I am Kurozuma...

145
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,750
The rightful head
of Big Spider.

146
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,125
You haven't forgotten,
have you?

147
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,750
You know that look
as well as I do...

148
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,250
The taunting look
of the espers.

149
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,000
We're all here to take
'em down a notch or two.

150
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,500
We're gonna show
'em who we are.

151
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,583
They'll know Skill
Out means business!

152
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,958
Yeah!

153
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,875
It's Big Spider again?

154
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,500
Yes... this is the
third time this week.

155
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,000
They seem to be kicking their
campaign into high gear.

156
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,833
We'll have to take the wind
out of their sails, then.

157
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,708
Not "we," Sissy...

158
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,666
You know full well that
I don't approve of you

159
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,458
getting involved in
our cases like this.

160
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,833
From what I can tell, it
was about two years ago

161
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,208
that Big Spider began
expanding their organization.

162
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,416
Around that time, they
started carrying weapons

163
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,125
and got involved in a lot
of criminal activities.

164
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,625
That makes sense...

165
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,166
They were armed,
so they must've thought

166
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,875
they could do anything...

167
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,250
but the question remains:

168
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,791
how were they able to
smuggle those weapons

169
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,541
into Academy City?

170
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,166
The distribution of goods
is strictly monitored...

171
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,416
So, in theory,

172
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,291
illegal items should
be easy enough to spot,

173
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,958
shouldn't they?

174
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,583
People who deal in such
things must have their ways.

175
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,208
They probably aren't
working alone.

176
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,875
It's likely they have
others setting up routes.

177
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,375
You think they
have backing?

178
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,750
Interesting...

179
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,916
At any rate, it's an
idea worth looking into.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,083
Um...

181
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,916
I've found something else...

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,750
It's the name of the
person who leads Big Spider.

183
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,458
Wataru Kurozuma...

184
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,333
By all accounts,
he's a very vicious man.

185
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,958
He doesn't seem
to have any qualms

186
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,208
about betraying
his followers...

187
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,833
Reports say that if
somebody leaves the group,

188
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,250
he won't hesitate to shoot

189
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,041
the so--called
traitor in the back.

190
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,125
So, basically this is
one of the biggest jerks

191
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,333
we've dealt with.

192
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,708
Oh... speaking of backs...

193
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,666
apparently this guy has a
tattoo of a spider on his.

194
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,083
A spider?

195
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,916
Really...? Didn't the
man who rescued Kongo

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,625
have a spider tattoo?

197
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,916
So he's the infamous
Wataru Kurozuma...?

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,708
But that doesn't
make any sense.

199
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,750
Maybe he wasn't
trying to rescue her,

200
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,458
but fighting a
faction of the gang...

201
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,416
According to Uiharu,
loyalty's not his strong suit.

202
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,666
You might be right.

203
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,916
It's at least something
we should consider.

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,375
According to my
information,

205
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,041
Kurozuma's base of operations

206
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:54,250
is in an area of School District
Ten known as "Strange."

207
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,541
Are we going?

208
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,416
Technically, it's outside
of our jurisdiction...

209
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,000
but since the incident
we're investigating

210
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,208
happened in District Seven,

211
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,791
I think we can make it stick.

212
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,041
Are you coming, Konori?

213
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,000
Sorry... I wish I could go.

214
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,416
But I absolutely have to
get these reports done today.

215
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,791
Huh?

216
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,500
Well... let's get going.

217
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,291
You know you shouldn't
get involved!

218
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,166
I'm pinch--hitting for Konori.
Now, come on.

219
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,000
Hold on, Sissy.
Did you hear what I said...?

220
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,083
Oh, all right...

221
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,833
I can never say no to you!

222
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,958
And off they go.

223
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,208
Always eager.

224
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,000
Here we are.

225
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,958
The headquarters
for Big Spider...

226
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,916
otherwise known as Strange.

227
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,333
Wow.

228
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,583
"Strange," huh...?

229
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,958
not a bad word to
describe this place.

230
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,333
It's not like
I expected them

231
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,125
to have their headquarters
in a mansion or anything.

232
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,708
But this is pretty bad.

233
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,291
Well, I guess I can see

234
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,250
how this would be a
fitting place for a gang

235
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,666
who commits the kind of
crimes that Skill Out does.

236
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,041
Although... as vile
as Skill Out is...

237
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,541
Maybe Academy City should
share some of the blame

238
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,708
for neglecting this area

239
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,666
and letting it become
so dilapidated.

240
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,708
I don't know about you,
but this definitely isn't

241
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,875
one of the warmer welcomes
I've ever received.

242
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,083
It would help if you didn't
have that armband on.

243
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,583
Wha-...?! You were
rushing so much,

244
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,041
I forgot to take it off...!

245
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,375
I'd planned on wearing
a disguise, b...

246
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,541
Hey, ladies. What brings
you to our part of town?

247
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,458
Take a look at this.

248
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,083
These two are
with Judgment.

249
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,458
-Are you here to arrest us?!
-So, like I was saying...

250
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,833
I get it, Sissy.

251
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,958
It looks like they're
having a little squabble.

252
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,708
It's too late to
run back home.

253
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,916
Hey now.

254
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,416
Picking on young
girls, are we?

255
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,166
I'm afraid we
can't have that.

256
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,958
What the heck?

257
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,375
Is that milk?

258
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,833
Yeah? Who do you
think you are?

259
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,666
Hold on a second, okay?

260
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,458
Huh? What the...?

261
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,583
I get it. He's trying to show
off in front of these girls

262
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,708
by playing hero.

263
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,333
Am I, now?

264
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,041
How 'bout you walk away
and mind your own business.

265
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,125
Uh... here you go, sir...

266
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,041
Um... Will this carton be
an acceptable replacement?

267
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,083
Yeah... thanks for
taking the trouble.

268
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,625
Oh, of course...
Well, we have to be going!

269
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,875
Sounds good...

270
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,125
You take care.

271
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,250
Good stuff. When it comes to
milk, it's gotta be Musasino.

272
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,333
You know, it's funny...

273
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,916
I don't remember
asking for your help.

274
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,541
Sorry about that.

275
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,750
It's just you reminded
me of a girl I once knew

276
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,875
whose chest was no bigger
than either of yours.

277
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,166
I couldn't walk away.

278
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,333
A man we've never met just made
a comment about our breasts.

279
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,000
And surprisingly, it
didn't sound offensive.

280
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,041
Hey hold on a sec.
We're not done!

281
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,208
Wait up, Sissy!

282
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,958
Mii...?,
You're home already?

283
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,541
It's not like you to be
home so early in the day....

284
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,250
What about your
work for Judgment?

285
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,083
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it...

286
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,416
What about you?

287
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,125
You could stop by the
branch once in a while.

288
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,333
Being on campus
is enough for me.

289
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,208
I have matters of love
and youth to attend to.

290
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,875
Honestly... You're always
like this, aren't you?

291
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,916
Hey... Is something wrong?

292
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,583
Not really.

293
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,875
'Kay.

294
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,208
Well... since you're
home early for once,...

295
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,166
maybe you can take a
turn cooking dinner.

296
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,208
Huh...?
That's not fair, Aomi!

297
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,708
Wow...

298
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,333
Nice, isn't it?

299
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,708
It's kind of a
secret spot...

300
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,291
The streets below can
start to feel suffocating.

301
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,291
But the breeze up here takes
you away from all that.

302
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,375
The view of Strange
from this rooftop

303
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,708
isn't any different than
it was two years ago.

304
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,041
Two years ago?

305
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,166
Well... a lot can happen.

306
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,000
I have to wonder...

307
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,166
Why do the members
of Skill Out

308
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,541
choose to be in this
area of all places?

309
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,958
It's not something you
two would understand.

310
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,375
It's not like I
don't understand.

311
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,958
Understand what?

312
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,000
The way the members
of Skill Out feel.

313
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,458
You keep trying and trying,

314
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,375
but your level never
goes any higher.

315
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,333
And eventually, you
start to lose hope.

316
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,791
I don't know...

317
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,208
It's like, after a while,

318
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,083
you feel like giving
up on everything.

319
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,708
We really have given
up on everything...

320
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,833
The system's broken.

321
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,791
So we left Academy City behind,

322
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,833
where everybody's
judged by their ability.

323
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,208
What about you?

324
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,625
Huh...? Me...?
No, no...

325
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,458
I decided that giving up
on everything doesn't help.

326
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:46,125
Yeah... from now on,
I'm gonna keep on trying.

327
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,291
For us trying to use
our esper abilities

328
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,666
is like trying to
touch the sky.

329
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,666
And the sky is
especially far away

330
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,458
from the alleys of
this city... So...

331
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,500
Whatever the reason, Skill Out
is still Skill Out, isn't it...?

332
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,041
Individuals may
be different,

333
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,625
but the group
is up to no good.

334
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,833
That's pretty harsh.

335
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,291
So what did the two of
you come down here for?

336
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,750
Oh, I almost forgot.

337
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,291
We're looking for an
organization called Big Spider.

338
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,083
If I were you...
I'd be careful

339
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,125
dropping that name
around here too much.

340
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,666
By any chance do you recognize
the name Wataru Kurozuma?

341
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,666
Nope. I'm afraid I don't.

342
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,916
Well... have a safe trip home.

343
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,458
What is it, Sissy...?

344
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,791
Is something the matter?

345
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:31,958
I don't know...

346
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,958
something about him
just bothers me.

347
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,458
Oh...! No...!

348
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,833
I don't know if
I can handle you

349
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,500
getting all hot and
bothered by this guy.

350
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,500
It's too much...!
Too much!

351
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,041
Ow...

352
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,750
Did you hear him?
He said he'd come back here

353
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,166
after being away
for two years.

354
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,958
Yeah, I guess so.
But what does that matter?

355
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,375
It was also
two years ago

356
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,083
that Big Spider began
expanding its operation.

357
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,000
Doesn't that raise
any flags for you?

358
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,208
Now that you mention it,
that is kinda weird.

359
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,875
Let's go and check out
some other places...

360
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,500
Maybe we'll
learn something.

361
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,625
Uh... Sure, Sissy,
but at least wait for me!

362
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,708
What are you idiots doing?

363
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,125
Over a dozen guys

364
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,458
from our esper hunting
parties have been taken down.

365
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,291
How is it we still
have no leads?

366
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,458
W... we are
looking, I swear!

367
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,041
Oh, you're looking,
are you?

368
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,000
Well looking isn't
gonna be enough...

369
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,291
You need to
find something!

370
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,416
Do you know why you
can't find anything...?

371
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,041
It's because they think
they're better than we are.

372
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,375
Listen up everybody ...

373
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,000
We need to show
'em they're wrong!

374
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,458
We need to hunt
down those espers

375
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,375
until they realize how
much power Big Spider has.

376
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,291
They'll see that they're
too weak to fight us.

377
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,958
Once we do that there
won't be anybody

378
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,250
standing in the way of us

379
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,375
and what we want!

380
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,958
Yeah!

381
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,166
After all this time,
he's still alive?

382
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,250
No... no way can
that be true.

383
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,041
But if...

384
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:59,916
If it is...
if he is alive...

385
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,583
Something needs
to be done.

386
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,375
W... What is this?!

387
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,458
I see... you guys
are Skill Out.

388
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,125
You're messin' with
the wrong guy...

389
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,125
I happen to be...

390
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,416
See that...?

391
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,708
Now, unless the rest of you
guys wanna end up like him...

392
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,583
Think we're scared of
someone like you?

393
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,583
What happened to all that
brave talk of yours...? Huh?

394
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,833
Go ahead and use
your ability on us...

395
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,375
Assuming you can concentrate
enough to calculate

396
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,750
while you're gettin' the
pulp beaten out of you.

397
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,041
Survival of the fittest is the
rule here in Academy City...

398
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,083
Right now we're the predators
and you're the prey.

399
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,208
You know...

400
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,500
It's pretty amazing

401
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,250
how quickly the hunters
can become the hunted.

402
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,875
Time for you to
face Judgment!

403
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,333
Why don't you keep moving?

404
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,333
Yeah, little girls,
run along and play now.

405
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,916
Why'd you have to go
and make it difficult?

406
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,458
I left the victim
at the nearby branch

407
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,750
to make his report.

408
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,083
These guys are finished.

409
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,791
Man... we searched
all over Strange

410
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,041
and didn't find anything.

411
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,416
Then we come
upon these guys

412
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,291
while just walking down
the street like normal.

413
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,416
So...? All's well
that ends well, right?

414
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,583
Yeah... I guess that's true...

415
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,916
Where to now?

416
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,375
What's goin' on here?

417
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,458
We represent Judgment!

418
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,916
What do they want?

419
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,333
You kids shouldn't be
messing around here.

420
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,166
Oh...? Judgment's
paying a visit?

421
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,166
What the hell do
you want with us?

422
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,583
Wataru Kurozuma, right?

423
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,916
You are under arrest

424
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,166
for your involvement
in leading

425
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,125
the recent acts of
violence against espers.

426
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,333
You're here to arrest me...?

427
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,041
Sorry, but I don't have
time to play house with you

428
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,500
and your little sidekick.

429
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,916
Now get lost.

430
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,625
You aren't very
polite, are you?

431
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,625
I'm trying to explain
things to you nicely...

432
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,041
but if you don't get it,

433
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,750
we can make you
understand the hard way.

434
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,416
Stand back, Sissy...

435
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,375
I can handle the likes
of these wretched pests

436
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,958
all on my own
without any problems.

437
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,791
Don't get ahead
of yourself.

438
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,458
'Cause ya see...
we have a secret weapon.

439
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,500
What is that
horrible sound?

440
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,958
It feels like it's reverberating
directly inside my head.

441
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:20,958
Is something wrong?

442
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,625
I can't do it!

443
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,375
Well, why aren't
you fighting...?

444
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,333
I thought you were gonna
take us all out by yourself!

445
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,416
Kuroko!

446
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,625
What happened...? I can't
aim or use my full power.

447
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,000
Heh... technical difficulties?

448
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,416
Let me tell you about
our handy new weapon...

449
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,583
That device over there is
called a Capacity Down system.

450
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,833
I don't know
much about it,

451
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,416
but I'll explain
what I can.

452
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
essentially, it jumbles up

453
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,208
the arithmetic
capacity of the brain.

454
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,458
But... it doesn't work on
members of Skill Out...

455
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,083
All we hear is a
high--pitched sound.

456
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,250
Annoying, but
harmless to us.

457
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,625
Capacity Down...?

458
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,916
Where on earth did
they get that thing?

459
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,500
Now... I would like
to hear you say,

460
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,041
"Please forgive us,
Mr. Kurozuma."

461
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,250
If you do that, I might
consider letting you go.

462
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,666
Oh...?

463
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,625
Did you say your
name is Kurozuma?

464
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,333
Ah! It's him!

465
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,041
Yeah! That's the guy,
all right.

466
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,333
Kurozuma! It's
the man from before!

467
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,541
He's the one who's been
interfering with us.

468
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,416
Kurozuma... it's you.

469
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,416
I'm confused.

470
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,791
What's going on?

471
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,375
-Kurozuma, what's the matter...?
-Let's see...

472
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,416
Kurozuma!

473
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,791
There we go!

474
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,750
The noise!

475
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,541
It's gone now!

476
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,000
Are you okay?

477
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,250
And you?

478
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,375
Uh... yeah.

479
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,291
-Hey, y...
-Hold this for me, will you?

480
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,916
Hey, Hebitani...

481
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,541
long time no see, huh?

482
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,041
No... impossible...

483
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,041
You've been dead
for two years...

484
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,708
There's no way you
could've survived.

485
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,250
Not after what happened.

486
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,416
Fine then,
have it your way.

487
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,958
I'm a ghost.

488
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,958
A ghost...?

489
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,125
That's right...
a ghost...

490
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,833
Time for you to go
back to your grave!

491
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,916
Go on...
let him have it!

492
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,458
He's just one guy,
isn't he...?

493
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,916
And besides,
we're all armed.

494
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,541
It's such a shame...

495
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,041
You've changed, Hebitani.

496
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:18,875
Die!

497
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,291
Put that away...

498
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,583
With your aim,
you'll probably

499
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,000
just end up shooting
yourself in the foot.

500
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,541
Hey, wait for us!

501
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,791
All done.

502
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,625
Starting to feel a
little better now?

503
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,291
More or less. Still not back
up to full power yet...

504
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,625
I'll be fine...

505
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,916
So, that guy...

506
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,291
He wasn't Kurozuma?

507
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,375
A long time ago,

508
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,375
back when I knew
him he was Hebitani.

509
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,208
Apparently he prefers
to go by Kurozuma now.

510
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,541
But... the real Kurozuma
is actually you, right?

511
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,958
Yeah, I suppose I've
been called that before.

512
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:13,875
When it comes to milk...

513
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,541
It's gotta be Musasino.

514
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,166
Konori?!

515
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,291
It's been a long time...

516
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,541
Mii.

517
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:37,166
[Music]

518
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,833
Hey, Konori,
what's going on...?

519
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,708
I don't understand what
you're so upset about.

520
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,791
Sissy...! Sometimes you
can be really naïve...

521
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,125
The next episode might
be too mature for you.
