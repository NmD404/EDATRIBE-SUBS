2
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,291
You know what
we should do?

3
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,083
We should go see
a movie today...

4
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,708
What do you think?

5
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,000
A movie? Yeah, maybe.

6
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,458
Here, this looks like
a good one, doesn't it?

7
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,666
It's called "Caught
Between Love and Youth."

8
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,333
yeah, sounds okay...

9
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,958
I guess I like a romance flick
as much as the next girl.

10
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,166
Oh, really?

11
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,791
You don't sound all
that interested.

12
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,541
I don't care one
way or the other.

13
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,083
We both have the day off.

14
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,916
I thought we could do
something together.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hey...! It looks like
they're having some kind

16
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,000
of summer festival on the
rooftop over at Seventh Mist.

17
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,958
Oh...? My guess is it's
just some silly event

18
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,166
designed to
amuse children.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,208
We won't know for sure
unless we see it, will we?

20
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,375
Uh... well, I mean...

21
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,083
it might be nice
to try something new

22
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,541
every once in a while.

23
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,875
Oh, I see what it is...

24
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,333
This is what you're
really interested

25
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,541
in checking out,
isn't it, Sissy?

26
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,166
It's not...!
I couldn't care less

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,291
about some stupid thing-

28
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,791
No need to be ashamed, Sissy...

29
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,625
You can tell me
if you like Gekota.

30
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:34,833
It's all right.

31
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,333
-I told you, I don't care-!
-Sorry I'm late!

32
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,041
I hope you haven't been
waiting for too long...

33
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,958
I missed the first bus.

34
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,208
No, no, don't
worry about it!

35
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,250
We only just got
here ourselves.

36
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,458
Hey, Saten's not
with you today?

37
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,916
Oh... well, you see...

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,125
Man! Extra classes
on a day off...?

39
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,333
That's a dirty trick
for them to play.

40
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,291
Yeah... and it's not
just our middle school

41
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,500
that's doing it, either.

42
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,541
They're calling
students together

43
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,916
from all over to participate

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,083
in some special
workshop for the day.

45
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,875
-A workshop?
-That's right...

46
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,750
I don't know what makes
it special, though.

47
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,291
Well, special or not, it's
bad luck for poor Saten.

48
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,500
Such a beautiful day
to be stuck in class.

51
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,041
This is it... at
least I think so.

52
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,208
Let's see here...

53
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,166
Hey...! Ruiko!

54
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,958
Akemi! Mu! Mako!

55
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey, guys.

56
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,208
What's with making us
climb all these stairs?

57
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,958
I'm exhausted.

58
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,125
Don't be such babies.
We just got here.

59
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,500
Yeah, well...

60
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,541
It was a whole
lot of steps!

61
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,291
This way, then.

62
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,666
Honestly...! This
is the worst...

63
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,125
Going to some school on our
day off to take extra classes,

64
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,333
and for what?

65
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,291
It's not like they're
gonna teach us

66
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,791
how to raise our
ability levels.

67
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,291
That would be too
easy, wouldn't it?

68
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,500
Normally, I'd be sitting
by the pool right now.

69
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,291
And what about you...? You
were planning to hang out

70
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,000
with Uiharu today,
weren't you?

71
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,083
Well... What
choice do we have?

72
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,208
What're we gonna
do with you,

73
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,041
not even putting up a fight?

74
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,125
Oh, come on...

75
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,666
You won't even
complain a little?

76
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,375
You're hopeless.

77
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,250
Hey... we've got a long
day ahead. Be nice!

78
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,083
Well, the quicker
we get started,

79
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,458
the quicker it'll end.

80
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,125
Let's hope so.

81
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,916
They really did
pick people

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,666
from all different schools
for this, didn't they?

83
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,041
It sure looks like it.

84
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,583
That may be the case.

85
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,458
But this is still
a lousy turnout.

86
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,375
It's so much easier to
doze off in class

87
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,166
when there are more
people there.

88
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,708
What's with
the long faces?

89
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,333
You all look like your
puppies just died.

90
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,625
Why did we come to this
thing, anyway, Boss...?

91
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,958
It's so lame.

92
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,083
Well, we're here, so
you might as well

93
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,583
quit your griping you got it?

94
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,833
Yes, I'm sorry.

95
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:17,958
-I didn't hear you!
-Scary...

96
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,041
They look like they're
in high school.

97
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,541
Quit staring!
They'll notice us.

98
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,125
No, no problems here.

99
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,541
Please, just take it easy.

100
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,083
Yes... got it.

101
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,666
Okay, kids,
that's enough...

102
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,166
Let's all get inside now.

103
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,625
Yeah? Who're you
supposed to be?

104
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,208
I'm your teacher
for today.

105
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,708
Our teacher? !

106
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,791
I'm Komoe Tsukuyomi and I teach
the morning class here...

107
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,250
If you want to
smart off to me,

108
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,791
I will happily extend
the lessons even longer.

109
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,333
One thing is paramount
if you wish to further

110
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,000
develop your abilities.

111
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,250
And that's the achievement
of Personal Reality.

112
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,458
Today, we're going to go
back to the basics

113
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,416
and really explore exactly
what that phrase means.

114
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,291
Personal Reality involves
the development

115
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,666
of a reality unto oneself,
separate from that

116
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,000
which may be accepted
as true reality...

117
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,333
As we study this concept,
we must also look at the

118
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,291
quantum theory and the
uncertainty principle

119
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,208
postulated by Heisenberg.

120
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,041
We must study
theoretical physics

121
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,875
because Personal Reality
and quantum theory

122
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,416
have something in common:

123
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,041
both are rooted
in probability.

124
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,125
Okay, unless anybody
has questions,

125
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,291
that should conclude the
morning lecture...

126
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,458
I'm sure you'd all like
a nice, long lunch break,

127
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,833
but please don't be late
to the afternoon class.

128
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,250
It's for your own
good, I promise.

129
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,916
Ugh.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,208
I thought lunch
would never come...

131
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,375
Hey... massage my
back, would you?

132
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,416
Do I have a choice
in the matter?

133
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,625
That feels so good!

134
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,166
You're becoming
an old lady.

135
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,916
Oh, shut up.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,250
We've been here
for so long.

137
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,708
I can't believe the
day's only halfway over.

138
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,625
This is seriously
draining.

139
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,583
Yeah, it is...

140
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,125
oh, now that you
mention it...

141
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,333
don't we have to go to
physical training

142
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,500
this afternoon?

143
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,125
We sure do.

144
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,416
Oh... and what's even worse you
guys know the teacher

145
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,875
they put in
charge of it...?

146
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,541
From what I hear, she normally
does this with Antiskill.

147
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,750
-Eh? !
-That is bad...

148
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,208
I bet she's gonna make us run
some really harsh drills.

149
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,083
I wanna go home!

150
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,250
Well... sitting around here's
not gonna help anything...

151
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,125
We might as well eat
while we still can.

152
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,250
What is it?

153
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,833
I forgot to bring
lunch with me.

154
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,000
Everyone else
has the day off.

155
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,541
Hey, it's me...

156
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,000
No, they're not open...

157
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,958
I'm gonna go out
and grab something. ...

158
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,416
Don't worry about it.

159
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,083
Hey, Saten.

160
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,583
So... long time no see...

161
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,750
Jufuku, remember?

162
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,291
Oh... uh... hi Jufuku...

163
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,625
Are you taking the
workshop this afternoon, too?

164
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,041
Yeah, I am.

165
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,750
Sorry, I didn't
notice you.

166
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,750
I didn't really want
to be noticed...

167
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,833
Have you forgotten my
Dummy Check ability...?

168
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,416
It comes in handy when
you don't want people

169
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,833
to realize you're there.

170
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,000
You made yourself
disappear?

171
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,333
No... My level isn't high
enough to manage that...

172
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:25,125
but I do have a knack for
making things seem less present.

173
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,916
Oh... I get it.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Uh... Saten?

175
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,583
Huh? ... Yes...?
What is it?

176
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,416
I wanted to say thanks
for always answering

177
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,750
the letters I wrote you...

178
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,333
I really appreciated it.

179
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,708
Oh... sure...

180
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,125
no problem...

181
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,416
I did promise I would.

182
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,083
But, uh...

183
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,333
Well... it would mean a lot to
me if you would write the

184
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,666
next letter first...

185
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,375
maybe?

186
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,666
Uh... Well...

187
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,083
if I get a chance...

188
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,291
It might sound silly, but
I sleep with the postcards

189
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,833
you send me tucked under
my pillow every night...

190
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,333
I like feeling
close to you,

191
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,041
even if it's only
in my dreams.

192
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,166
That's... very sweet.

193
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,458
You know... I'm so glad
I came today...

194
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,541
I was really dreading
coming to this stupid

195
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,166
"special" workshop...

196
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,791
But it turns out I
was wrong, though.

197
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,375
Since I got to see you.

198
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,333
Hey... you... you know...

199
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,000
um... if you feel like it,

200
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,750
maybe we can eat
lunch together.

201
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,375
Oh... I can't...

202
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,041
I forgot to bring one, and
the cafeteria's closed...

203
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,500
So I'm gonna have to go
out and pick something up.

204
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,958
That's okay...

205
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,375
I mean, I actually packed
way more than I can eat today.

206
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,375
You're welcome to have
some if you'd like.

207
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,583
Oh... thanks, but-

208
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,708
Wow! You're sure
you don't mind?

209
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,125
Not at all.

210
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,875
Please help yourself
to whatever looks good.

211
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,708
Okay, thanks a lot.

212
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,041
You made this? It's delicious!

213
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,208
You think so...?
I'm glad to hear it.

214
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,541
You know...

215
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,333
It felt really awkward
sitting in that classroom...

216
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:12,000
almost like I should be
ashamed or something.

217
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,083
Why do you say that...?
We're all in the same boat.

218
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,333
Well... That's kinda the
point, isn't it?

219
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,375
They've gathered together
a certain type of people.

220
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,666
I wonder if there will
be more workshops...

221
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,833
for people like us.

222
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,041
Maybe...

223
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,958
but even if there
are more of them...

224
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,375
There's nothing
we can do about it.

225
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,083
There's nothing we can do.

226
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,875
It's hot out here.

227
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,541
I can't believe they're
making us work out in this.

228
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,125
Isn't this some
kinda abuse?

229
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,500
Can you do anything
but complain...?

230
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,958
You think whining's gonna make
it any cooler...? Huh?

231
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,083
Sorry Boss!

232
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,916
Seriously scary.

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,041
What did I tell you earlier?
Don't stare at them!

234
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,916
Okay, look
sharp, people...

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,208
In case you
haven't guessed,

236
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,625
I'm your physical
training teacher,

237
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,458
Miss Yomikawa...

238
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,708
Nice to meet you all.

239
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,666
Nice to meet you
too, Miss Yomikawa.

240
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,000
All right, that's
enough of that.

241
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,708
Why don't we get started
with an endurance run?

242
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,958
-Ugh! -That sounds awful!

243
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,583
-Are you serious? !
-It's too hot! No way!

244
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,000
Not up for testing
your limits?

245
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,875
Slow down, Ruiko.

246
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,416
You should be conserving
your strength.

247
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,541
I don't get why we're even
doing this in the first place.

248
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,875
It's not fair.

249
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,666
What's the point in making
us run until we drop...?

250
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,000
Torture?

251
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,500
Hey, you three!

252
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,958
Stop dragging your feet...

253
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,583
I know you can go faster.

254
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,000
When you don't think
you can run any farther,

255
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,666
then raise your hand.

256
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,458
She's enjoying this.

257
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,000
Keep moving!

258
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,208
Yomikawa runs her classes
like a drill sergeant...

259
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,625
Hang in there, kids.
You can do it.

260
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,416
Get through this...

261
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,750
and you may overcome
something greater.

262
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,500
Run!

263
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,208
Get up...! On your feet!

264
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,166
I can't do it.

265
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,500
I can't...

266
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,750
You giving up?

267
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,125
Yes, ma'am. I give up.

268
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,500
All right, make this
last lap a sprint.

269
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,500
Huh? !

270
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,333
I said, sprint!

271
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,500
Just hang in there.

272
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,166
You're almost done now.

273
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,083
Okay, very good...

274
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,458
How about going
for one more lap?

275
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,458
I can't run anymore.

276
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,000
Get up.

277
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,875
Get up and give
me one more lap.

278
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,250
You call this training? !

279
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,208
I certainly do.

280
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,708
How can you...? All you're
doing is putting her

281
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,375
through the ringer!

282
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,583
Why not go ahead and
call this what it is...

283
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,416
It's punishment...!
Admit it, lady!

284
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
The whole point of this
so--called workshop

285
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,208
is to punish us!

286
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,416
It's nothing of the sort.

287
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
Then why do you
have us running

288
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,500
until we're too
exhausted to move?

289
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,583
The point is to teach you
how to overcome your limits...

290
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,000
Look at him.

291
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,666
He was the first one
to raise his hand...

292
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,833
yet he's still running.

293
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,458
When you convince yourself
you can't do any more

294
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,875
you're finished...

295
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,625
Even though you may still
have some strength left

296
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,750
that you're
just unaware of.

297
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,958
Her, for instance.

298
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,416
So sure she couldn't
go one more step.

299
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,166
Until she ran
another lap...

300
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,541
Where do you think
the strength to run the

301
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,333
additional lap came from?

302
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,291
The same applies to
developing your abilities.

303
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,583
What I wanted to teach you
today is not to decide

304
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,583
so quickly what
your limits are.

305
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,750
Oh, please!

306
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,125
Don't give me that crap!

307
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,666
She's down!
Are you okay, Boss?

308
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,750
You think we
won't go after you

309
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,000
because you're a teacher? !

310
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,250
That will be all.
Class dismissed.

311
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,208
You're running away?

312
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,916
Time's up for today.

313
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,958
Everybody hurry
back inside!

314
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,041
Hey, Ruiko!

315
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,708
Come on! Hurry!

316
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,125
Quick, before
you get soaked.

317
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,458
It should clear up by
the time we're done here.

318
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,833
Aww, man...

319
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,500
after the last class,
they're gonna make us

320
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,041
take an ability test...

321
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,541
We know how that
one's gonna turn out.

322
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,875
"When you think you
can't do any more,

323
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,791
-you're finished!"
-Dead on...

324
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,125
Always nice to hear
another empty pep talk.

325
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,541
You know...

326
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,166
maybe that punk
girl was right earlier

327
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,791
and this workshop doesn't
have anything to do

328
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,916
with education.

329
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,708
Like I said: punishment.

330
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,291
First we all
slip into comas,

331
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,583
and then they force us to
take these stupid classes...

332
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,916
I wonder what'll
be next...

333
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,708
They could at least have
been straight with us.

334
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,333
Why didn't they
come out and say

335
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,875
we're being punished instead of
pretending it's a workshop...?

336
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,000
I mean, come on...

337
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,333
was what we did
even that wrong?

338
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,500
Who wouldn't want to
level up so easily?

339
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,000
In this world, you gotta
take every advantage you get.

340
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,666
Yeah, you've got
a point there.

341
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,000
It's not right to cheat.

342
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,250
Um... Ruiko...?

343
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,041
We all cheated,
so it's only natural

344
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,458
that we're being
punished for it.

345
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,500
My, aren't you a
good little girl?

346
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,375
You idiot!

347
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,875
Why did you challenge
her like that?

348
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,708
Aren't you scared of her?

349
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,916
Yes... Terrified, actually...

350
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,041
Her eyes are like daggers.

351
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,500
Even so... you didn't
back down one bit...!

352
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,458
I swear I could see sparks
when their eyes met.

353
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,041
Me, too!

354
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,416
Then there was
that popping sound!

355
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,666
I think that was
just thunder, guys.

356
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,875
I know what I heard.

357
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:19,958
Sparks or not...

358
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,458
what Ruiko said was right.

359
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,000
It was wrong
of us to cheat.

360
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,041
It was.

361
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:35,791
It appears that some of
you may have jumped

362
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,791
to the wrong conclusion.

363
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,916
So before we continue, I
want to clarify something.

364
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,541
Please understand
this workshop

365
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,833
was not intended as a
punishment for students

366
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,000
who used the Level Upper.

367
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,375
Certainly, your actions
were far from laudable.

368
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,958
It would've been better
had you resisted

369
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,708
the temptation
to use that device

370
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,541
to augment your abilities.

371
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,375
However... we do
not want you to feel

372
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,083
a disproportionate
sense of shame

373
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,083
or remorse for
having done so...

374
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,666
As far as punishment goes,

375
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,375
I'd say slipping into a
coma should suffice...

376
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,583
That's a far more harrowing
experience than a workshop.

377
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,916
You've already paid for
your transgressions

378
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,041
the hard way...

379
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,375
So, instead of feeling
guilty or bitter,

380
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,291
why not make the most
of all you've gone through?

381
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,333
The Level Upper gave
you a taste of power

382
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,333
that you've never had before.

383
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,500
However, that power didn't
come from some device.

384
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,083
It was already inside
you, waiting to come out.

385
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,916
As I'm sure my friend Miss
Yomikawa would tell you...

386
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,875
"You convinced yourselves
you'd reached your limits,

387
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,083
but... you overcame them."

388
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,416
Okay then.

389
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,958
With that said, we'll
begin the last class

390
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,375
of the workshop...

391
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,458
I want you to think about
using the Level Upper...

392
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,208
Close your eyes if it
will help you focus.

393
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,333
Concentrate on the time
you used your power.

394
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,916
As clearly as you can,

395
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,041
remember every aspect
of how it felt.

396
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,708
Now, I want each of you
to try to achieve

397
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,708
your own Personal Reality...

398
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,250
or at least
reinforce the footholds

399
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,083
that you already
have in place.

400
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,500
A new reality...

401
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,208
my own reality...

402
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,625
Concentrate.

403
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,000
So, anyway...

404
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,291
he told me to study up
on "Personal Reality,"

405
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,791
but I just don't get the
concept, you know?

406
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,375
Maybe it has something
to do with the power

407
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,625
of our own belief...

408
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,791
The way we shape
the assumptions

409
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,375
we make about the world.

410
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,666
I'm sorry...

411
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,458
I came so close...

412
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,166
So close to
losing something

413
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,666
far more important to me
than some stupid ability.

414
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,583
I couldn't take it...

415
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,958
I was so tired of
not having any power.

416
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,000
And finally, it
didn't matter anymore

417
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,166
what lengths I had
to go to to get it.

418
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,625
I understand.

419
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,125
But this doesn't
have to be it.

420
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,166
You'll be fine,
Saten... I know you.

421
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,958
You're too stubborn
to give up easily.

422
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,708
Don't stay here and let
yourself be defeated.

423
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,916
You are not defective.

424
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,708
There's nothing
wrong with you.

425
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,000
So... don't give up!

426
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,708
Okay, everyone!

427
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,833
We're going to
finish up the day

428
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,375
with a quick
ability test...

429
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,000
Go ahead and pack up your
stuff and follow us, please.

430
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,708
So, how did you
guys do on the test?

431
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,166
My numbers were
actually up a little.

432
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,125
No way! Mine, too!

433
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,083
But our levels are
still the same as ever.

434
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,958
I know...! Let's go do
something to celebrate

435
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,458
the workshop being over.

436
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,833
Good idea.

437
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,916
Hey... you coming
along Ruiko?

438
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,666
Oh... I don't know.
Let me think.

439
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,000
No... sorry...

440
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,208
Go ahead without me.

441
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,333
I've got something I
need to take care of.

442
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,416
Like I thought.
It's from Jufuku.

443
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,541
I'm so glad we got to
spend time together

444
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,916
again today, Saten...

445
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,416
It was really inspiring.

446
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,041
Seeing you go lap after
lap in the endurance run...

447
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,791
And the way you stood your
ground with that scary

448
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,000
high--school girl when
everybody else was afraid to...

449
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,583
Watching you be brave
gave me more courage.

450
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,375
I'm gonna try to learn
from your example...

451
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,375
I'll stop moping about
things I can't change

452
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,916
and be strong like
you, instead.

453
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't think I'm
all that strong.

454
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,250
Of course I wasn't
going to do that well...

455
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,833
For now... ...

456
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,958
-I'll just keep trying. ...
-I'll just keep trying.

457
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,375
Oh... hey...
how's it going?

458
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,333
Pretty good.

459
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,500
All right! Done for the day.

460
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,583
It's time to go home.

461
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,458
All finished, Saten?

462
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,708
We wanted to come
by and pick you up.

463
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,916
How did it go?

464
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What was the hold up...?

465
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,875
You took so long
coming out of there,

466
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:58,916
we thought you'd
already left

467
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,166
and headed for home.

468
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,791
You should have
seen it, Saten.

469
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,333
Without you, we weren't
able to decide

470
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,541
on a single thing to do.

471
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,250
Yeah? Then what've you
been up to all this time?

472
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,625
So, Saten...

473
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,166
how does going to
the movies sound?

474
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,500
Huh? Forget that.

475
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,833
They're having
some kind of event

476
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,041
on the roof at
Seventh Mist...

477
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,083
-Doesn't that sound fun?
-Well, I...

478
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,458
Do you really want to
see Gekota that badly?

479
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,458
I told you, that isn't it!

480
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,250
So, you see, we've been
split between two ideas.

481
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,083
We spent the whole day at
the restaurant talking it over.

482
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,375
And... you want me to pick?

483
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,625
It's the movie, right?

484
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,041
Hey, Kuroko! No fair!

485
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,458
Okay...! I say we
go to the pool!

486
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,666
Eh? !

487
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,166
But that wasn't
one of the options.

488
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,541
All right then. Why
don't you decide Uiharu?

489
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,541
-Huh?
-Seventh Mist, right?

490
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,458
No, the pool!

491
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:56,500
[Music]

492
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:06,541
[Music]

493
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:16,541
[Music]

494
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:25,083
[Music]

495
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,958
What...? Armed gunmen are
hunting down espers?

496
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,333
This is the work of the
gang known as Skill Out.

497
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,458
What should we do,
Konori...? Konori...

498
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,333
did you hear me?
