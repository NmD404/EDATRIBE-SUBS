1
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,250
Hot, hot, it is
so hot in here.

2
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,750
Come on, wake up...!

3
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,666
Please, open your
eyes, Sissy!

4
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,041
Sissy!

5
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,916
Wake up already...

6
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,041
Okay, well maybe a
kiss will help, then...

7
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,583
This isn't a fairy
tale, ya know.

8
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,791
But it did work.

9
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:00,958
You're awake
now, aren't you?

10
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,500
That's unexpected...

11
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,250
Why are you
two still here?

12
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,500
Yeah, well, there's
something we needed to ask you.

13
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,291
I find it unbelievably
hot in here...

14
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,416
It's the middle of summer.

15
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,750
Shouldn't they
at least turn on

16
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:44,958
the air conditioning for us?

17
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,333
You do make a good point.

18
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm very sorry, but we had
a power outage last night.

19
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,250
Things haven't been
restored to normal quite yet.

20
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,625
All right, then...

21
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,750
They're using emergency
power for basic operations

22
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,208
and critical patients.

23
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,000
Again, seriously? !

24
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,708
Your solution to this is to
take off all your clothing? !

25
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,250
Well... it's really
hot in here, y'know?

26
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,833
We're not alone. There are
people everywhere!

27
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,791
What if I just leave
my underwear on?

28
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,416
No, not going to work.

29
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,750
All right.

30
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,291
Dr. Kiyama, we're really
interested in your opinion

31
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,791
on these patients
as a specialist.

32
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,583
I'd be happy
to help you...

33
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,708
but it's so hot in here.

34
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,083
Saten's running
really late.

35
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,375
Got on the blue
stripes today, huh?

36
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,041
In your email you said you
wanted to show me something.

37
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,958
That's right, and I
can't wait anymore.

38
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,125
This thing is
so incredible.

39
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,875
I've finally found
the elusive item

40
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,041
we've all been looking for!

41
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,750
Ta--da!

42
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,666
That just looks like
a music player to me.

43
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,166
It's what's on it
that really matters.

44
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,375
Just wait... I'll
show you later, okay?

45
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,500
Now, I'd like to pick up
where we left off,

46
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,875
if it's okay...

47
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,583
Why are swimsuits acceptable
and underwear is not,

48
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,666
when both expose the
same amount of skin?

49
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,416
No.... that
isn't the point.

50
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,708
This "Level Upper?"

51
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,791
Can you tell me what kind
of thing it is, exactly...?

52
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:27,916
What does it do...?

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,916
How is it used?

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,625
Unfortunately,
we don't know.

55
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,583
No details so far...

56
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,208
but it might have
something to do with the

57
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,416
students who have fallen
into comas recently.

58
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,083
That's what
you think, yes?

59
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,458
Right.

60
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,583
So... why bring this
problem to me?

61
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,541
Well, I've been giving this
some serious thought lately...

62
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,541
It seems that elevating
one's ability

63
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,541
might well disrupt
normal brain function.

64
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,166
If that's the case...

65
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,416
I think we'll need help
when we find this thing...

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,125
and I feel that your
professional experience

67
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,625
could be invaluable.

68
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,750
This is something I would
be happy to help with.

69
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,750
I am a
cerebrophysiologist...

70
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,541
it's my area... .

71
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,000
Aside from that...

72
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,250
there is something else
that's been bothering me.

73
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,125
Who are those girls?

74
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,750
Oh... so you're a brain doctor?

75
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,416
Are you here to look
at Shirai's brain? !

76
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,000
We are conferring with her
about the Level Upper matter.

77
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,791
Well, if that's the case-
This is pretty serious...

78
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,625
Anyone found in
possession of it

79
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,041
will be taken into custody.

80
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,208
Isn't that a bit extreme?

81
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,833
The investigation
is ongoing,

82
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,791
so I can't tell
you everything...

83
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,916
but it does seem that its
users suffer some side effects.

84
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,833
Anyway... I find
the users of any drug

85
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,541
usually turn to crime.

86
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,583
Saten, is there
something bothering you?

87
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh...

88
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,000
no. Not at all.

89
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,666
I'm so sorry!

90
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,791
Please don't
worry about it...

91
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,708
It just got on
my stockings...

92
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,416
so once I take
them off....

93
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,125
How many times do
we have to tell you

94
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,916
not to take your clothing off
while you're in public? !

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
Look at me for a moment.

96
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,750
It's not like I'm anything
particularly special...

97
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,666
No man in here is going to
care about seeing my body.

98
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,958
Everyone has
different tastes,

99
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,500
so you can't really know...

100
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,250
Besides which,
it's not only men

101
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,916
you should be thinking
of, you know? !

102
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,000
I know you're busy,

103
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,250
so thank you for giving
us this information.

104
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,500
No... I thank you...

105
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,833
This has reminded me of the
time when I was a teacher...

106
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,083
I've enjoyed it.

107
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,666
I didn't realize you'd
been a teacher before.

108
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,083
I was once...

109
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,708
Bye.

110
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,375
I don't know what to say.

111
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,625
She's a little
different, huh?

112
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,333
Aren't you a little
different, too?

113
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,041
All right then...

114
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,458
I think it's time we headed
back to the office now.

115
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,000
That's a good idea...

116
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,583
and we should put whatever
data we have together

117
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,166
for Dr. Kiyama.

118
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,375
Yes, you're right.

119
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,875
Okay guys, so we're all
ready to head back

120
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,250
to the branch then, yeah?

121
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,958
Where did Sissy go?

122
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,125
I don't want to
give this up.

123
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,083
It's not like
I've used it yet.

124
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,666
So I don't have
to tell anyone.

125
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,125
But I worked so
hard to find it.

126
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,208
Are you okay?

127
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,333
Misaka...! Why are-

128
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,666
Well, you disappeared
so suddenly.

129
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,000
I was a little bit
worried about you.

130
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,375
Oh... it's nothing, really.

131
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,750
Are you sure?

132
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,375
Oh, well... It's
just that you know,

133
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,208
it feels like
everybody is involved

134
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,916
in this case
other than me.

135
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not Judgment
or anything.

136
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,541
Thanks you didn't
have do that.

137
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,833
You've always got that
thing hanging from your bag.

138
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,458
Yeah... I guess I do.

139
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,375
I got it from my mom.

140
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,375
It seems silly, huh...?

141
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,208
It's not as if good luck
charms are scientific

142
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,125
You're gonna be an esper,
Sis, that's so cool!

143
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,833
Sweetheart...

144
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,250
I need you to know...

145
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,083
I'm not totally on
board with this.

146
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,833
Mom's a big
worrywart, huh?

147
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,625
I'm just concerned
about her.

148
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,416
I don't want them
messing with her head.

149
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,875
It's not like
that at all, Mom!

150
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,500
I want you to take this.

151
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,875
A good luck charm?
That's not scientific!

152
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,291
No matter what happens,
you can always, always,

153
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,750
come back home...

154
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,291
I want you to know,

155
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,083
you're more important to
me than anything else.

156
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:22,208
At the end of the day, my
mom is just superstitious.

157
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,666
It's not like something like
this can protect me anyway,

158
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,125
right...?

159
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,250
It's not as if
it's magic.

160
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,333
It sounds like your
mom is really nice...

161
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,166
What I mean is, she
cares enough about you

162
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,125
to give you a charm
like that, right?

163
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,625
Yeah, she's a good mom.

164
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,250
But even still...
sometimes I feel like

165
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,791
I'm not living up
to expectations...

166
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,125
It's been all this time,

167
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,000
and I'm still only
a Level Zero.

168
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,708
Aw, Saten, really...?

169
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,958
Does your level
matter that much?

170
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,250
How is it going?

171
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,375
There's a lot of code
and jargon here,

172
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,791
so it's hard to
know for sure,

173
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,041
but I think
I've managed

174
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,000
to uncover some
sites that look like

175
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,416
they're Level Upper
exchange spots.

176
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,208
Good job, Uiharu!

177
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,291
A list of
presumptive places.

178
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,916
Wow, there sure are a lot
of them, aren't there?

179
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,875
Hey, what are you doing?

180
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,125
It has to be one of these
places, right...?

181
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,625
So, if I go through
them one--by--one,

182
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,166
I'll find it eventually.

183
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,541
Level Upper, huh?

184
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,041
It's everything
I've dreamed of...

185
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,875
Something that will
finally make me an esper.

186
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,791
But I don't know
anything about it,

187
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,208
and that scares me...

188
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,791
What if it isn't good?

189
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,708
You said you would
give it to me!

190
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,416
Where's the Level Upper?

191
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,000
The price has gone up.

192
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,750
If you want this, it's gonna
take another hundred thousand.

193
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,875
Could you just give
me my money back?

194
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,666
Please, just stop!

195
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,208
Quit whining and
give us the money!

196
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,625
Is he a test to see how
elevated your levels are?

197
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,083
Need to know how far
you've come, huh?

198
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,208
I should really call
Judgment or Antiskill.

199
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,000
Aw, great! My battery's dead!

200
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,625
Really...

201
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,416
what can I do...?

202
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,666
There are three
of them...

203
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,458
and I'm barely out
of grade school...

204
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,250
What can I possibly hope
to accomplish...?

205
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,125
I'm a level zero...

206
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,791
how can I help in a
situation like this?

207
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,625
You leave him alone!

208
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,250
Can't you stop?
He's already hurt...

209
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,208
and Antiskill will be
arriving at any moment!

210
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,500
'Scuse me... What did you say?

211
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,500
You've got a smart mouth
on you, don't you, kid...?

212
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,166
But you also don't
have any power...

213
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,708
so what right do you have
to tell me what to do?

214
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,291
You have power, so you
think you've earned it.

215
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,083
Well, I've got news
for you: you haven't.

216
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,583
So leave her alone...

217
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:46,083
You're a bunch of pathetic
losers with no power at all!

218
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,750
And I am an officer
of Judgment!

219
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,250
Shirai's here?

220
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,500
I'm placing you under arrest
for aggravated assault...

221
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,166
Now cooperate.

222
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,333
Ha...! You've got to
be kidding me, here!

223
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,958
One more little kid to deal
with isn't gonna a problem.

224
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,125
You should really
be more careful...

225
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,125
I've been running around
the city for hours already...

226
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,000
and then I finally find
what I'm looking for

227
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,666
and it's a bunch of thugs
assaulting my friend.

228
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,625
What are you
talking about?

229
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,791
It looks like I'm
going to be hazardous

230
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,208
to your health today.

231
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,333
Interesting... quite a skill.

232
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,125
Teleportation, huh...?

233
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,375
I never seen
that before.

234
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,083
It almost seems like
you're disinterested...

235
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,166
but you're very much
involved right now.

236
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,791
Before the Level Upper,

237
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,375
we used to be scared
of you Judgment types.

238
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,583
But there have been some
pretty big changes lately,

239
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,625
you see...

240
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,958
We're stronger.

241
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,500
And now that we've
gotten stronger...

242
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,125
we'd like nothing more
than to pound you

243
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,333
and people like you
into the ground!

244
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,041
Too bad you're
going to lose to-

245
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:15,958
He vanished!

246
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,083
He came from behind me.

247
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,458
He must've sneaked
up somehow.

248
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't think I
have much choice!

249
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,166
I'm going to have
to use these on him.

250
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,041
I... missed him!

251
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,416
First I have to figure out

252
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,375
why I can't anticipate
his movements.

253
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,000
Yep, that was a different
direction than I expected.

254
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,666
That was pretty cool,
I have to say...

255
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,583
You cracked, what,
one, two ribs?

256
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,875
What do you think
you're doing now...?

257
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,875
Aw, don't tell me you
can't teleport anymore.

258
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,958
I'm not through
playin' just yet.

259
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,208
What, are we
playing tag, now?

260
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,125
It's fine if
you wanna run away,

261
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,458
but that means the
other two are forfeit...

262
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,750
the girl and the fatty...

263
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,125
I'll just kill them.

264
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,500
This building is scheduled
for demolition...

265
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,583
I probably won't be able
to find anywhere safe

266
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,250
to hide in here.

267
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,875
I don't hear anything...

268
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,625
no footsteps.

269
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,458
Okay... at this point,
he should still think

270
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,250
I'm on the first floor.

271
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,000
Ah...! Found ya!

272
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,208
Funny story: one
of our hangouts

273
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,375
happens to be
in this building...

274
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,125
so I know every last
little nook and cranny.

275
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,500
And in here...
sound resonates.

276
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,916
Hey, kid...

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,041
you heard what I said
about sound, didn't you?

278
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,958
You can spend all your
time tiring yourself out

279
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,958
and runnin' away...

280
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,750
I don't think it'll
take very long...

281
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,791
I'll get you soon enough.

282
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,750
Seems like you're finally
tired of playing tag.

283
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,458
All right, girl...

284
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,000
let's take care of this.

285
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,916
I kinda pity you...

286
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,083
Your life is going to
end before you even know

287
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,875
what ability
ultimately did you in.

288
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,416
I know more than
you think...

289
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,916
You have the
power to mislead

290
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,083
peoples' visual perception...

291
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,125
You distort the light
around you to make it show

292
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,416
what you want it to show.

293
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,458
You figured it out.

294
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,625
Your legs swing around
at an impossible angle...

295
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,083
Things I throw trace an
impossible trajectory.

296
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,833
Basically... you project
the image of yourself

297
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,791
to a different location.

298
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,791
So my focus is diverted
to a different area...

299
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,916
and my attacks end up
missing your actual body.

300
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,833
That explains it...

301
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,583
The pins I threw curved...

302
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,250
Because of you!

303
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,208
Heh... Enjoy.

304
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,125
I call it Trick Art...

305
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,375
So what now...?

306
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,541
How do you plan on
fighting against my power?

307
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,208
You have nothing to rely
on but your own eyes.

308
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,250
Perhaps...

309
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,875
Maybe what you
say is true,

310
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,833
and I can't hit you directly.

311
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,125
Huh? ... What are you
trying now, girl?

312
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,250
Here's the thing
about teleportation...

313
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,291
It means I have the
power to displace matter

314
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,958
from one place to another.

315
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,291
One example of this is
my ability to cut through

316
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,916
these steel--reinforced
columns with window glass.

317
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,916
Look, this is your
final warning.

318
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,208
Drop your weapon
and surrender...

319
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,458
If you refuse, I can't
guarantee your safety.

320
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,250
Give up...?.. Are
you kidding me...?

321
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,916
I'm not the one who
should be surrendering here.

322
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,250
It's sad really...

323
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,541
I wish our situation
didn't have to be this way.

324
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,208
But unfortunately you're
leaving me with no other option.

325
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,791
You should say
your prayers...

326
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,250
'Cause at this point...

327
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,791
I'm afraid I have no
choice but to crush you...

328
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,000
your little light trick

329
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,041
isn't going to
save you this time.

330
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,708
What the hell d'ya
think you're doing?

331
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,750
Do you know what will
happen after I destroy

332
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,000
all the columns that are
supporting the building?

333
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,833
You can make a
guess, can't you?

334
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,208
You wouldn't...! No way...!

335
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,500
You can't do this! ! !

336
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,375
I was a little worried
I may have overdone it a bit,

337
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,916
but... hah...

338
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,458
it was scheduled for
demolition anyway,

339
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,791
so I guess it's
no big deal.

340
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,791
Now... I'll be taking that
Level Upper from you. 'Kay?

341
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,541
Aw, do you wanna cry?

342
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,916
We can go demolish
some more buildings

343
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,625
if you would like.

344
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,625
Are you kidding me?

345
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,833
The best you can do is
hand me a music player...?

346
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,833
Please, don't
be ridiculous.

347
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,583
But the Level
Upper, it,

348
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,583
it's a song!

349
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,375
Wha-what did you say?

350
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,708
That's some good work...
We'll take over from here.

351
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,791
Gosh... I'm so glad
Shirai is safe.

352
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,541
I feel this way...

353
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,541
but I'm not proud.

354
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,500
She's a friend...

355
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,041
She's my age...

356
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,625
We are so similar
in so many ways,

357
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,666
but she happens to be
Levels up from me...

358
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,375
and it hurts a
lot of the time.

359
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,708
How can a Level Zero
relate to an esper...?

360
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,291
I wish I knew.

361
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,958
Ruiko!

362
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,083
Hey! ...

363
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,375
How's it goin'? !

364
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,291
Akemi? ... And Mu...

365
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,166
and Mako, too!

366
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,125
What are you doing
here alone, studying?

367
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,708
Yeah, I guess you
could say that...

368
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,083
What about you guys?

369
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,583
Just studying
at the library.

370
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,166
We can't change
our ability levels,

371
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,666
but we still have to
keep our grades up.

372
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,083
Yeah, I know.

373
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,125
Oh, hey guys, have
you heard about this

374
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,583
Level Upper thing?

375
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,708
Hold on what are
you talking about?

376
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,208
Oh I know...

377
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,375
It's the thing that's supposed
to increase your ability.

378
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,583
Yeah, yeah...

379
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,125
and I heard someone
say that it goes

380
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,166
for a lot of money
on the black market.

381
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,708
Well, I don't
have any money!

382
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,458
Um... hey, you guys...

383
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,458
I have one...

384
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,583
you know...

385
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,833
I've got one of them.

386
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:41,833
[Music]

387
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:54,125
[Music]

388
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,250
Maybe I was
trying to pretend

389
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,250
I was okay with not
having an ability.

390
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,375
And maybe I was wrong...

391
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,166
Saten...! Please, no!
