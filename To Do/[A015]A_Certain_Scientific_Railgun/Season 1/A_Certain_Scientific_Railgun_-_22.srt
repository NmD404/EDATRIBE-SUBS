1
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,666
Bye!

2
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,208
I'll miss you so much!

3
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,333
I'm so sorry, Erii.

4
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,333
But don't worry...

5
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,916
We'll see
each other again.

6
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,041
-Bye!
-See you later!

7
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,250
See you!

8
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,625
Bye, Banri!

9
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,916
Take care of yourself.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,958
[Music]

11
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,000
That's how Banri and I met.

12
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,625
We were in the same
Child Error facility.

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm really shy
around other people,

14
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,583
so I don't make
friends easily.

15
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,791
But for some reason,

16
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,708
it wasn't as hard to
be friends with Banri.

17
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,166
Whenever she spoke to me,

18
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,125
it was always using
our telepathy.

19
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,625
but then she was transferred
to another facility.

20
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,333
And that was it.

21
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,458
But lately...

22
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,791
I've been hearing
Banri's voice again...

23
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,208
just like when
we were young.

24
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,916
She's asking for help...

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,833
telling me she's
in a lot of pain.

26
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,625
But I... I don't know why...

27
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,791
and I have no idea
where she is now.

28
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,250
I want to help her.

29
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,750
But there's
nothing I can do.

30
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,041
I wish... I wish I
knew where she was.

31
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,916
It will be all right!

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,041
I'm sure you'll
find her again.

33
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,708
No... I'll find her for you!

34
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,041
As a Judgment officer,

35
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,500
that's the least
that I can do.

36
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,916
You really can?

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,458
Yeah! Despite her appearance,

38
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,291
Uiharu's actually an
excellent Judgment officer.

39
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,875
"Despite my appearance?"

40
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,125
Oh, sorry...
my bad.

41
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,500
Anyway, just leave
it to me, okay?

42
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,791
Thank you so much!

43
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,750
You must be tired
after all this.

44
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,333
You should get some rest.

45
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:07,166
No. I'm fine, really.

46
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,166
The Level Upper incident.

47
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,958
-You mean...?
-Yes.

48
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,666
Harumi Kiyama
was responsible,

49
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,541
and I saw into her past.

50
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,000
Haru'ue's friend, Edasaki,
was in the flashback.

51
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,625
An induced burst experiment

52
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,500
to analyze the law
of runaway abilities.

53
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,500
It's hard to believe such an
experiment would be conducted.

54
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,291
I know. From what I can tell,

55
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,625
the person in
charge of it all

56
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,333
was an old researcher
named Kihara.

57
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,583
Kihara...? Do you
mean Gensei Kihara?

58
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,875
I've never heard of him.

59
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,375
He's a scientist...

60
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,208
A famous one,
in some respects.

61
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,708
Though "mad scientist"
might be more accurate.

62
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,958
I know some of his work.

63
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,416
He's not above human
experimentation.

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,125
His current whereabouts
are unknown, however.

65
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,458
If he actually carried
out such an experiment...

66
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,958
then it's entirely possible
that the children he used

67
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,541
are the source of the
recent poltergeisting.

68
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,125
What do you mean exactly?

69
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,708
That all those
child subjects

70
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,583
have become runaway espers.

71
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,208
How's that possible.

72
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,833
Kiyama was certain the
children are asleep, even now.

73
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,875
What if their abilities
are out of control

74
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,125
while they're unconscious?

75
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,416
Oh, no.

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,583
You think the interference
isn't intentional,

77
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,666
but rather the accidental result
of their unconscious state?

78
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,000
It is a possibility.

79
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,958
Where are the children now,
do you girls know?

80
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,500
Antiskill has been searching for
them ever since the incident,

81
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,625
but they still haven't
discovered their location.

82
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,041
Oh.

83
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,625
Well, it sounds like
finding these kids

84
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,250
is our top priority.

85
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,833
Now then, the lucky
color of the day is pink.

86
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,083
That's a good sign, huh?

87
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,291
Whoa... this is crazy!

88
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,750
You're telling me that
Edasaki, Haru'ue's friend,

89
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,250
was one of Kiyama's
students...

90
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,833
and that these
children are the ones

91
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,875
causing the poltergeisting?

92
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,208
Yes, that's the
hypothesis, anyway.

93
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,333
Until we actually
locate the children,

94
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,083
we can't know anything
for certain, though.

95
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,541
Okay, but how are we
supposed to find them?

96
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, maybe...

97
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,375
I see what you're
getting at.

98
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,625
We should use the computer
to find where they are.

99
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,041
That means you're
up, Uiharu!

100
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,291
Right...? You'll look.

101
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,916
Of course I'm
going to look...

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,708
but I don't like this.

103
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,250
We've cleared Haru'ue,
and now you turn around

104
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,083
and start suspecting
her friend?

105
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
That's it!
You're being unreasonable!

106
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,833
Those poor kids.

107
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,291
They need help.

108
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,666
They're pleading.

109
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,333
Hey, Sissy?

110
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,458
You've been in there
for a long time.

111
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,666
Yeah.

112
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,291
I've got a lot to think about.

113
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,916
After today,
I guess we all have.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,041
So what are you
going to do?

115
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,500
Don't you want to
make up with Uiharu?

116
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,250
It's not like I don't
understand why she's upset.

117
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,833
But still...

118
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,416
I'm a Judgment officer.

119
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,166
I've done nothing more
than duty requires.

120
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,208
Uiharu feels betrayed because
I investigated her friend.

121
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,250
Even so...

122
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,041
I'm sure she'll
come around.

123
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,541
She'll see that I just...

124
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,750
Don't think I'm gonna
let you come in here

125
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,500
just because we're talking!

126
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,458
Huh?... I thought it would be
a perfect opportunity for...

127
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,541
Get out!

128
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,125
Here. I brought snacks.

129
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,916
They're from a shop
in District Eight

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,208
that's famous
for its pastries.

131
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,916
You went that
far to get them?

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
You'll understand why.

133
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,250
These are the best cakes
in all of Academy City.

134
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,291
Oh, I got the
sweet--bean filling.

135
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,875
You have to go
with the classic.

136
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:49,958
Wow...

137
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,166
That far and
they're still warm?

138
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,125
Actually...

139
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,791
That's because I used
my ability on them.

140
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,375
It doesn't sound
that fancy,

141
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,875
but I can maintain the
temperature of things I touch.

142
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,000
I can't handle anything
that's really hot,

143
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,625
so I just stick with
moderately warm items,

144
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,250
like pastry.

145
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,416
I haven't told the
others about this...

146
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,333
not even Saten.

147
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,916
But it's only fair.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,416
You told me about
your ability,

149
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,208
so I told you about mine!

150
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,166
So... it's good?

151
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,750
It's delicious.

152
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,041
It's so good.

153
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,333
According to
Kiyama's deposition,

154
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,125
there were ten human
experimentation subjects.

155
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,333
They were all put in
a vegetative state.

156
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,791
And then they
were divided up

157
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,083
and taken to different treatment
centers across the city.

158
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,750
But they aren't
there anymore?

159
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,750
Right. They were
transferred repeatedly,

160
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,041
and somewhere along the way,
the trail vanishes.

161
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,291
Yeah.

162
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,250
How about you take
a quick break?

163
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,333
No, thank you.

164
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,583
Saten... where are you going?

165
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,500
Uh... I don't know.

166
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,708
Well... why don't
we get a drink?

167
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,875
Thanks. It's just really hard

168
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,541
to be around
them right now.

169
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,875
I know.

170
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,125
I wish there wasn't so
much tension between them.

171
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,083
We need to find
Edasaki somehow.

172
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,916
For Haru'ue's
sake naturally...

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,250
but for Uiharu's
sake as well...

174
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,791
and I'm sure it would
make us feel better also.

175
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Absolutely.

176
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,541
Who's that...?

177
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,125
Yes, Misaka here?

178
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,458
-Kiyama is out on bail?!
-Yes.

179
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,250
I went to speak with her
at the detention center

180
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,666
about the child experiments,

181
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,583
but she'd been released.

182
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,083
After everything she did,

183
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,666
I can't believe they would
let her see the light of day!

184
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,708
I don't know the specifics
of her bail agreement...

185
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,666
but it's a done deal.

186
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,208
Crazy!

187
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,708
I don't know how
we'll ever be able

188
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,958
to locate the
children without her.

189
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,250
Huh...

190
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,583
Something about this
doesn't make sense.

191
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,833
Everything Kiyama did was
for the sole purpose

192
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,375
of rescuing those children.

193
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,625
Why would she go
through all that

194
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,791
just to turn around and
use them like this?

195
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,583
It's not so surprising.

196
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,500
She is the same one who
exploited students' desires

197
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,166
to increase their abilities.

198
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,791
I said no, thanks.

199
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,791
How about you stop
playing the martyr?

200
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,666
Oh. I'm sorry.

201
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,875
You've been at
this for a while.

202
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm surprised you haven't been
able to track them down yet.

203
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,125
I'm not done.

204
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,250
There's still more data
that I need to trace.

205
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,458
Hey... what's this, here?

206
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,375
It's something about AIM
Diffusion--field resonance.

207
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,875
And how that's a
possible cause

208
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,083
for mass outbreaks
of RSPK syndrome.

209
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,666
Resonance?

210
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,833
Yes, that's right.

211
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,083
The way in which the
AIM diffusion fields

212
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:08,500
of similarly--typed espers
resonate with each other.

213
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,250
It starts with one runaway
esper being tampered with.

214
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,750
Then, like a domino effect,

215
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,291
other espers of a like type
are triggered as well.

216
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,958
The resonating esper powers
share general characteristics.

217
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,208
Let's look at your
ability as an example.

218
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,916
Similar types would
include espers

219
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,791
who can manipulate either
electrical or magnetic fields.

220
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,791
Which means there is a
wide range of espers

221
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,875
who could resonate with you.

222
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,416
And that means... A
similarly wide range exists

223
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,583
for the ten child experiments
who have gone missing.

224
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,583
Imagine if all of their
runaway abilities

225
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,333
have been activated.

226
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,625
Their sphere of influence among
other students would be huge.

227
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,875
As high as
seventy--eight percent.

228
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,750
Really...?
Seventy--eight...?!

229
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,208
But then.

230
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,458
We could see poltergeisting
on such a large scale

231
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,875
that it would tear
apart the entire city.

232
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,208
All right, but who says
this theory is correct?

233
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,041
Take a closer look at the
person who wrote this article.

234
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,291
Gensei Kihara?

235
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,583
After what we
learned earlier,

236
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,000
I looked into him.

237
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,458
His whereabouts are
indeed unknown,

238
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,416
just as Therestina told us.

239
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,333
All of the research facilities
he was associated with

240
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,583
are shut down...

241
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,958
and his data has
been scattered.

242
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,958
What is it?
Is something the matter?

243
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,583
Huh...? Oh, no.

244
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,875
Not really.

245
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,583
Ah! Oh, Sissy!

246
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,291
Oh, you're so rough!
No, please don't stop!

247
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,916
If I had time,
I'd slap her silly

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,750
and put a stop to
whatever she's dreaming.

249
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,791
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,291
All right.
My disguise is complete.

251
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,000
If the power isn't on,
I guess I didn't need a mask.

252
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,541
I was right.

253
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,208
This is it.

254
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,000
For whatever good that does.

255
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,833
No, there is
nothing left here.

256
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,791
Yes. I'm pulling out now.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,958
It's her!

258
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,041
You again.

259
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,166
I knew it.

260
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,041
Harumi Kiyama.

261
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,375
Can I help you
with something?

262
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,333
Are you responsible for
these latest events, too?

263
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,750
What would you
do if I was?

264
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,000
Stop you, that's what!

265
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,083
Hey...! What the...
What's happening?

266
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,458
Well, that's that.

267
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,791
Nice job back there...

268
00:13:58,875 --> 00:13:59,958
Sending an
electric current

269
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,333
through a dead
security system.

270
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,708
It's not like that's
what I meant to happen.

271
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,958
But never mind that...

272
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,583
What were you
doing there?

273
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,000
How did you get
out on bail?

274
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,750
What are you
planning now?

275
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,416
This situation feels
regrettably familiar to me.

276
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,458
Being interrogated in my
own car by a schoolgirl.

277
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,333
-Huh?
-Well, sorry.

278
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,500
But the questions will
have to wait for later.

279
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,666
What is this place?

280
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,791
Come this way.

281
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,208
What's that?

282
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,750
If you've peeked
through my memories,

283
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,750
you should know the
answer to that question.

284
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,708
These are them.

285
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,208
These are my students.

286
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,541
I was right.

287
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,875
You are the one

288
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,083
who's behind all these
poltergeisting incidents.

289
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,500
I am.

290
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,291
It's true.

291
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,833
However, there is a rather
long story behind it all.

292
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,875
Oh, and... as you
may have noticed,

293
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,000
this is a hospital.

294
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,791
Please try to refrain from
the use of electric shocks.

295
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,750
I remember you!

296
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,375
Long time, no see, huh?

297
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,958
Will someone please tell
me what's going on here?

298
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,500
Gensei Kihara.

299
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,500
It was with him that
all of this first began.

300
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,583
Consider these questions.

301
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,166
Why are we here?

302
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,541
What is our
ultimate purpose?

303
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,041
For what reason was Academy City
designed and built

304
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,916
in the first place?

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,708
Yes... there is one
fundamental reason.

306
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,875
Creating a being who
transcends mankind:

307
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,875
A Level Six.

308
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,083
What you are
looking at now

309
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,958
are the results
of much research.

310
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,541
Signal pathways form

311
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,041
that differ from a
normal neural network

312
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,583
within the brains
of runaway espers.

313
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,416
Various neurotransmitters
and hormones

314
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,375
are secreted abnormally.

315
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,666
Through the process of
extracting those secretions

316
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,500
and then condensing
and refining them,

317
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,708
we can produce an ability
crystal such as this.

318
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,500
And by administering
this crystal

319
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,291
to a specially--selected esper,

320
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,416
we can produce the long
sought after Level Six.

321
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,833
Yes, the ability crystal

322
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,750
will help us realize the
ultimate purpose of our city.

323
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,791
The creation of SYSTEM.

324
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,541
After all these years of
stumbling through the dark

325
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,916
we may at last find someone
who attains the power of God

326
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,333
while still inhabiting
a mortal body.

327
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,458
You really believe it?

328
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,666
That you'll be able
to create a Level Six

329
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,333
using your ability crystal.

330
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,625
Of course I believe it.

331
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,041
And the price?

332
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,666
Intentionally impairing
consciousness...

333
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,166
leaving the subjects vulnerable
to serious side effects.

334
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,166
My experiments have
produced consistent results.

335
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,666
Is that so?

336
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,291
And how many
victims do you have?

337
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,833
Victims?

338
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,750
My research produces
answers, not victims.

339
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,791
Don't be ridiculous.

340
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,416
Perhaps he truly
did not see the harm

341
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,708
he was causing
with his work.

342
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,625
But there were victims.

343
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,791
The more I learned about
the facts of the case,

344
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,083
the more convinced I became.

345
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:30,125
Finally, there
was no denying it.

346
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,291
The Child Errors that Kiyama was
trying so desperately to save

347
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,083
were used as test subjects
for Kihara's ability crystal.

348
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,583
The burst experiment
I told you about.

349
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,166
The one that analyzed
runaway abilities...

350
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,750
that was part of it, too.

351
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,000
The experiment you
saw in my memory

352
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,458
was a dosing of the
ability crystals.

353
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,166
Crazy... all this to
create a Level Six,

354
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,125
which we barely
know anything about?

355
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,750
These poor kids have
ended up like this.

356
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,791
And that's the
reason behind it?!

357
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,625
And now I am
doing what I can.

358
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,833
I hope my talents
as a doctor

359
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,833
will allow me to save them.

360
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,583
Luckily, it didn't
take too much time

361
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,541
to get them all
transferred into my care.

362
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,583
My name carries a
certain amount of weight

363
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,375
in this town, you see.

364
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,166
However, I did need to
speak to a specialist

365
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,875
about how to revive them.

366
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,708
That's how you made bail.

367
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,708
He did me a great favor.

368
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,750
I'll be forever grateful.

369
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,833
Thanks to my access
to this facility,

370
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,500
I have a rough idea of how
to revive the children.

371
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,125
You can save them?

372
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,541
Unfortunately, another
problem has arisen.

373
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,416
What's that?

374
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,541
As they approach
awakening...

375
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,083
their AIM diffusion field
readings have abnormal values.

376
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,416
Which means?

377
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,750
Their powers are
out of control.

378
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:52,833
They've triggered cases of

379
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,791
multiple simultaneous
RSPK Syndrome.

380
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,583
But why?

381
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,833
It seems Kihara's research
hasn't stopped entirely.

382
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,500
If he was using the
ability crystal

383
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,833
that I knew he
had developed,

384
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,625
then the children
should not have set off

385
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,916
any poltergeisting events.

386
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,583
But there seems to be an
upgraded crystal at work here.

387
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,708
He has turned these
children into runaway espers.

388
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,083
Even as they lie here,
in a deep sleep.

389
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,333
So... if you did
try to wake them up,

390
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,291
the poltergeisting.

391
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,875
Yes.

392
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,125
The force would
be incalculable.

393
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,666
What now?

394
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,541
We have to do something.

395
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,000
I am developing a program

396
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:35,291
that will bring their abilities
under control, but...

397
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,500
The building block of
Kihara's ability crystal

398
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,083
is known as the
First Sample...

399
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,833
It is a refined extraction

400
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,041
that is derived from the
very first human subject

401
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,041
of the experiment.

402
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,333
If I'm going to complete
the vaccine software,

403
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,708
I have to analyze the data
contained within that sample.

404
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,833
So then that's why you were
back at that laboratory.

405
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,375
Yes, I was looking
for that data.

406
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,625
Unfortunately, I
didn't find anything.

407
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,333
But I'm not
about to give up.

408
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,041
That data is indispensible

409
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,541
to the continued research
of ability crystals.

410
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:11,416
There's no way something
like that would be discarded.

411
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
It must be out
there somewhere...

412
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,291
and I swear,

413
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,583
I'll do whatever it
takes to find it!

414
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,458
I see.

415
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,958
And what if you can't?

416
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,916
Then I will still
wake up the children.

417
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Even knowing the kind
of damage it'll cause?!

418
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,666
I will not allow them to
remain like this forever!

419
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,041
I understand...
but... you can't.

420
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,708
She's right.

421
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,000
Because I won't let you.

422
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,375
Therestina?

423
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,666
Hello, there.

424
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,875
Sorry, but I followed you.

425
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,041
What the...?

426
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,041
We're the Multi
Active Rescue Team.

427
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,041
These children are
in our custody.

428
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,000
It's best if you
do as we instruct.

429
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,958
Do I have a choice
in the matter?

430
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,375
No. It's our duty to
seek out and prevent

431
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,291
any situation that might
endanger Academy City.

432
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,291
Naturally, I have a
warrant with me.

433
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,583
Feel free to read it...

434
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,166
though, I had hoped
you would cooperate

435
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,041
and make the
process easier.

436
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,666
This looks to be in order.

437
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,000
Please, don't worry.

438
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,125
This kind of thing
is our specialty.

439
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,166
We have a facility ready
to offer the children

440
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,333
whatever treatment
they need.

441
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,625
But, please...

442
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,750
And our data access
exceeds yours.

443
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,500
We can find information you
could never lawfully obtain.

444
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,750
Earlier, you mentioned something
called the First Sample.

445
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,375
It's possible that
we can acquire data

446
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,000
on that item as well.

447
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,291
Secure them.

448
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,666
Hold on!

449
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,416
What are you doing?

450
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,458
You told me that if I didn't
like what you were doing,

451
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,625
I'd have to come
and stop you.

452
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,291
Move, now! I'm the only one

453
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,041
who can possibly
save those children!

454
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,458
But you haven't, have you? !

455
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,625
First it was the
Level Upper...

456
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:11,083
now these poltergeist
attacks... and still...

457
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,000
You haven't saved
one of them.

458
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,041
I'm so close, though.

459
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,166
I'm just one step away.

460
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,875
I have to.

461
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,166
You know Edasaki?

462
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,833
Well, she's asking
for help, even now.

463
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,083
I met this girl.

464
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,875
Her name is Haru'ue.

465
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,958
She's Edasaki's friend.

466
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,541
She can hear her voice.

467
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:41,666
[Music]

468
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,750
Carry them out.

469
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:48,791
[Music]

470
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,208
I'm nervous. It's been a while
since I've done a preview.

471
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,458
I'll feel more comfortable if
I just remove some clothing...

472
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,166
For the millionth time: No...!

473
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,041
Things are getting serious,
so behave!
