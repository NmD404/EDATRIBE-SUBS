1
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,958
A Level Six esper?

2
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,083
Yes.

3
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,375
That's what you
will become, dear.

4
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,708
You will be the
very embodiment

5
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,583
of Academy City's
greatest dream.

6
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,125
Oh, Grandfather...!

7
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,416
How amazing!
Will that really happen?

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Yes.

9
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:55,000
Today... we lay the
groundwork... dear.

10
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,333
Yellow Marble leader
reporting in, ma'am.

11
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,916
We have arrived.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,083
Now commencing
installation.

13
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,958
Brown Marble leader,
how are you coming along.?

14
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,000
Is the blue car
following you?

15
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,666
Right on schedule.

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,958
Then it's time to put an
end to these foolish dreams.

17
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,416
I'm tired of waiting.

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's move right
to the finale.

19
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,416
Just you wait.

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,000
When I get my
hands on you....

21
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,583
What was that?

22
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,541
Come on...

23
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,083
Is this really
your idea of fun?

24
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,583
Just a fancy little
trick I wanted to try.

25
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,916
What are you doing?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,250
Why the hell did you
choose now to interfere?

27
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,958
Well, say something!

28
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,541
Dr. Kiyama...!

29
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,166
Those trucks are only decoys!

30
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,083
The children
aren't inside them!

31
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,083
They're not there...?
But...

32
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,583
-Come on, Saten, hurry.
-Calm down, I'm going.

33
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,541
Hey, wait...! What do you
two girls think you're doing?

34
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,875
Watch it. You're squishing me!

35
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,833
Just sit still!

36
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,208
I'm going to be
your navigator.

37
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,250
Now, get in...!

38
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,041
You want to save
the children, right?

39
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,625
Okay, get ready, Sissy!

40
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,958
If you guys wanna fight,
I'm happy to play along.

41
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,500
Helicopter, huh?

42
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,041
I think you're
about done here.

43
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,750
Ugh. I recognize that
ability all too well.

44
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,041
I think you can
relax, ladies.

45
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,875
The cavalry is here.

46
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,416
Try not to be too
intimidated by my ability.

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,083
"Aero Hand" will make
swift work of our opponents.

48
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,333
That was good timing!

49
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,666
Go on. We can take
care of things from here.

50
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,000
You go catch up with
Kiyama and the others, Sissy.

51
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,166
Kuroko.

52
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,958
All right, then.

53
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,166
But you had
better catch up.

54
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,750
Or you'll answer to me!

55
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,541
Who would dare
to assault me?

56
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,791
I am Kuroko Shirai
of Tokwadai,

57
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,166
partner of the
great Railgun!

58
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,166
Hold on! That phrase sounds
suspiciously familiar...

59
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,791
Konori! On it!

60
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,083
We're ready now.

61
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,875
Let's do this!

62
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:54,916
[Music]

63
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,958
I have to say...

64
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,000
This is rather
unexpected...

65
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,416
I never thought we would
team up for a fight.

66
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,333
We can use this opportunity
to settle something:

67
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,250
Whose ability is
the greater one.

68
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,666
Shortly after the
other squad moved out,

69
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,666
Antiskill surveillance picked
up something interesting.

70
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,458
They recorded two
transport vehicles

71
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,666
posing as civilian trucks
departing MAR headquarters.

72
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,333
-Most likely...
-Those are the real transports.

73
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,416
I can't believe I fell
hook, line, and sinker

74
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,125
for that madwoman's
amateur trick.

75
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,291
We need to hurry...!

76
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,958
It looks like the transport

77
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,583
has already reached
its destination.

78
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,875
Where is it?

79
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,541
An unused propulsion
system laboratory

80
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,916
in School District
Twenty--Three...

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,416
Take this exit
on the left.

82
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,666
Oh... Good work, Doctor...

83
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,625
Of course, I wouldn't
expect anything less

84
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,041
from an opponent like you.

85
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,625
Hold on tight!

86
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,166
That's what will make killing
you such an amusing task!

87
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,000
Hold on, Konori.
I've got this!

88
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,125
Hey... what made
that thunk just now?

89
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,458
Come on, come on!

90
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,875
I want to see you run like
your life depends on it.

91
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,250
Which, of course, it does.

92
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,583
Better keep moving!

93
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,416
I know that voice.

94
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,458
So do I.
That evil witch.

95
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,833
Hey... That's Misaka.

96
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,291
Uh... what are you
doing out there?

97
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,000
Quick, you need
to go faster!

98
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,875
Yes, I kind of
noticed that.

99
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,416
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,208
About before...

101
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,916
I was wrong, I know that.

102
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,125
I suppose I can't
really blame you.

103
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,083
In your position, I would
have done the same thing.

104
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,583
I'll make up
for my failure.

105
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,458
I'll beat her...

106
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,708
I will!

107
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,500
My attacks were deflected!

108
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,250
Did you really think your little
shocks would work against me?

109
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,541
All right, then.

110
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,333
Take this!

111
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,166
I know about
that trick, too.

112
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,458
Impossible!

113
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,291
I've done my homework,
you see.

114
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,541
I'm up to date on everything
they have in the databank

115
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,541
concerning that
ability of yours.

116
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,333
Including the especially
interesting fact

117
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,916
that your railgun's range
is only fifty meters.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,666
I'm getting sick
of this woman.

119
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,333
Take the next
turnoff on the left.

120
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,916
What's that?

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,375
Tch... I missed...

122
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,041
Oh, well.

123
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,458
The targets are headed
your way now, Green Marble.

124
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,458
Crush them.

125
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,500
We're under attack!

126
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,791
Take care of it!

127
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,958
There's no way you're
getting past us,

128
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,291
so you shouldn't
bother trying!

129
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,500
Yes, that's right.

130
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,791
We've managed to gain
control of all ramps

131
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,375
from this point forward.

132
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,875
Sorry, but we're being
harried from above, too.

133
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,791
This is the most we can
do for you right now.

134
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,541
Why is Antiskill
helping me?

135
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,833
Never mind that.

136
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,791
Just hurry up and get
to those children!

137
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,500
Why am I surrounded
by incompetents?

138
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,708
Very well. I'll take
care of it myself.

139
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,708
Huh...? Again?

140
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,291
Hold on tight up there!

141
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,333
It's a lost cause.

142
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,458
Give up, already!

143
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,541
You don't stand a chance!

144
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,666
It doesn't matter how hard
you try or how fast you run.

145
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,500
You might as well
pack up and go home.

146
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,416
You're never gonna be
able to save those brats.

147
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,916
I'll make sure of it!

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,083
I won't stop.

149
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,791
I swore that I
would revive them!

150
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,000
I have to try!

151
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,000
A teacher doesn't give
up on her students

152
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,708
just because
things get tough!

153
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,833
I would never
expect you to.

154
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:02,916
No matter what happens,

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,666
I'll make certain
you get to them.

156
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,000
That's why I'm here.

157
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,208
And I promise you, I'm
not gonna give up, either!

158
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,416
Little fools.

159
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,833
You don't have any
cards left to play now.

160
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,916
Just roll over and die!

161
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,041
Misaka! Misaka!

162
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,833
Ha! Another pathetic
attempt...!

163
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,875
I know all of your
attacks, remember?

164
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,583
Nothing you can do
will surprise me!

165
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,875
Oh, really?

166
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,875
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

167
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,416
Kuroko!

168
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,416
On my way!

169
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,750
Yes, I can fire coins.

170
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,000
But that isn't all.

171
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll show you the full
extent of my power!

172
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,958
What the...?!

173
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,125
How rude.

174
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,750
Teleporting away without
warning like that.

175
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,333
Shirai, Misaka!

176
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,833
You guys terrified us...!
Are you okay?

177
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,791
Yeah, we're fine.
Don't worry.

178
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,833
You saved us.

179
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,000
-I want to...
-Hold on.

180
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,375
Don't say it...

181
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,583
Let's wait until after
we've saved the children.

182
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,000
Right.

183
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,666
Well?

184
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,791
Can you figure it out?

185
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,375
Almost there.

186
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,291
The security on this
is pretty tight.

187
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,958
How annoying.

188
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,291
This would be a lot easier

189
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,583
if you hadn't taken out
every single one of them.

190
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,666
Oh, yeah...? How was
I supposed to know?

191
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,708
I figured they would have
left at least one person

192
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,250
inside to guard it.

193
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,791
Got it!

194
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,666
In this facility,
there's only one area

195
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,958
where power consumption
is especially high.

196
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,875
The lowermost block.

197
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,208
I found you!

198
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,333
Haru'ue...!
Can you hear me?

199
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,666
Wake up!

200
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,083
We came for you...!
All right...

201
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,083
where's the control
panel for this?

202
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,666
Hold on...
I'll go look over there.

203
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,166
Great, thank you!

204
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,083
Not long now.

205
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,333
We'll get you
out of there.

206
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,958
What is it...?
What's the matter?

207
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,000
No, that sound again!

208
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,333
It can't be.

209
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,208
But it is.

210
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,458
You pesky, meddling brats.

211
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,375
Oh, no.

212
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,791
It's her!

213
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,125
This is to pay you
back for earlier!

214
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,625
Shirai, Misaka!
You okay?

215
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,250
How dare you?!

216
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,666
What was that?

217
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,500
Ah... that felt good.

218
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,500
You think you can get away
with making me look like a fool?

219
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,250
Her again!

220
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,750
You're using
Capacity Down!

221
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,166
Misaka described
it to us before...

222
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,208
The sound it emits
only affects espers!

223
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,541
This is Capacity Down?

224
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,041
What's your point?

225
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,708
Knowing what it does isn't
going to protect you from it.

226
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,875
She told us that you'd
upgraded it, though.

227
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,583
That the speakers were a lot
bigger than they were before.

228
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,000
Too big to be
moved easily.

229
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,375
That's right.

230
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,583
It wasn't easy to do,

231
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,416
but I've placed them
throughout the facility.

232
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,666
Would you care to go around
destroying them one by one?

233
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,958
It still has to have
a control center.

234
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,583
And its size limits
where that could be.

235
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,291
I know a little about this
building's structure.

236
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,541
From what I can tell...

237
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,750
the power center must be
back where we just were.

238
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,708
The central control room!

239
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,875
Uiharu...

240
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,208
You might be right.

241
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,708
But what does
that matter...?

242
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:23,291
There's nothing you
can do about it now.

243
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,083
Ugh. Do all little girls
talk as much as you?

244
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,625
You should thank me.

245
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,916
I'm about to show you
something amazing.

246
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,125
The culmination of
years of research.

247
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,458
The completion of
the ability crystal.

248
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,125
How can you?

249
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,500
I don't understand.

250
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,666
You're a victim
in this, too.

251
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,333
Your own grandfather used
you for his experiments.

252
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,041
He made your ability
run out of control.

253
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,583
And yet here you are.

254
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,541
You're wrong.

255
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,791
I'm no victim.

256
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,291
I'm Academy City's
ultimate dream.

257
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,666
This seed of greatness
was born thanks to me.

258
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,416
And I intend
to let it bloom.

259
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,333
It can't be.
That vial.

260
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,750
It contains
the First Sample?

261
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,708
Using this, I am finally
going to create a Level Six.

262
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,291
-Hah!
-A Level Six.

263
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,333
-No way.
-Oh, yes.

264
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,791
This young girl
is about to become

265
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,375
the first esper in Academy City
to reach Level Six.

266
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,083
The power of the other
children will flow into her!

267
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:22,833
You can't do it!

268
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,125
Not Haru'ue!

269
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,291
Under specific wavelengths,

270
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,333
she has a reception
ability above her level.

271
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,750
It was truly a stroke
of luck to find someone

272
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,416
whose ability can resonate
with the crystal like hers can.

273
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,083
High--level Telepaths
are quite rare, after all.

274
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,833
Why them?

275
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,375
Why use these same
children again?

276
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,500
Why are they always the ones
who have to suffer the most?

277
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,250
It's not so bad.

278
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,208
They probably won't
even feel a thing.

279
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm just going to
borrow the realities

280
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,083
they've created
inside their minds.

281
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,041
You're talking about
Personal Reality.

282
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,000
You can call it
whatever you want.

283
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,208
Shall I explain
the process to you?

284
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,208
Essentially, I'm extracting
the neurotransmitters

285
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,666
that control activity
within the brain.

286
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,125
Particularly those which
make them runaway espers

287
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,791
and fusing them
with the First Sample.

288
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,666
By doing so, I will
create an inhibitor

289
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,583
for the ability crystal.

290
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,208
And it will be
perfected at last.

291
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,666
The old geezer never
could figure it out.

292
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,916
He spent all his time
applying minor changes

293
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,916
that were
ultimately useless.

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,666
And now...
only one step left.

295
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,125
Don't do it!

296
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,083
Why not?

297
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,208
Do you realize
what will happen?

298
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,041
If you do this, and
the children awaken

299
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,875
while still in their
runaway state.

300
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,458
Then Academy City
will be hit

301
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,750
by an unprecedented
wave of poltergeisting,

302
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,541
and it will be destroyed.

303
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,250
So what?
That's fine by me.

304
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,291
"Someone who attains
the power of God

305
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,375
while still inhabiting
a mortal body."

306
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,083
Creating such a person is
the whole point of this city!

307
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,166
And once that's done,

308
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,083
there's no real reason
for Academy City

309
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,166
to remain standing anymore.

310
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,000
Careful.

311
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,250
You're going to
get yourself hurt.

312
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,708
Dr. Kiyam...

313
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,541
Just lay there and be quiet
like a good little girl.

314
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,666
Please, Saten!

315
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,833
Please hurry!

316
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,166
Come on!

317
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,375
Where is it?

318
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,500
I have to find that
Capacity Down thingy!

319
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,083
You said something
interesting before.

320
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,666
I can hear her.

321
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,541
That Skill Out members
weren't my lab rats.

322
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,041
Well, you were just one
word away from being correct.

323
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,166
They aren't my
only lab rats.

324
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,083
No, you are all my lab
rats, don't you see?

325
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,791
Would you prefer a different
analogy? Very well.

326
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,875
Academy City is
my breeding farm,

327
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,791
and all you children
are my livestock.

328
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,916
Misaka... hang on...

329
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,416
I think it's time to
put you down, though.

330
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,583
What the...?

331
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,375
What was that?

332
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,458
I don't give a damn if
you think we're lab rats.

333
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,833
Don't forget.

334
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,500
Rats have sharp teeth!

335
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,791
That sounds like.

336
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,041
Thank goodness! Saten!

337
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,500
There's another one
of you brats here...?

338
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,750
How is she still standing?

339
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,875
I'm not going
to tell you twice.

340
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,791
Keep your hands
off my friends!

341
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,291
-It went away!
-Damn it!

342
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,625
Fine, then.

343
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,791
Looks like it's time
to change tactics.

344
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,000
Fortunately, I have a plan B.

345
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,958
I'm going to blow you
and this whole place away!

346
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,541
I built this
particular weapon

347
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,125
after carefully
analyzing your ability.

348
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,583
It's even more powerful
than your railgun.

349
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,291
Honestly, first laboratory rats,
then livestock.

350
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,000
How bitter and pathetic
do you have to be

351
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,416
to think so lowly of
other human beings?

352
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,291
You may be a Level
Five Electromaster.

353
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,791
In this town, however,
you're nothing more

354
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,916
than a bunch of data.

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,541
That's right!
Just a bunch of data

356
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,625
with two legs
and a smart mouth!

357
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,375
That's where you've
got it all wrong.

358
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,791
The people of Academy City
are so much more than that.

359
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,333
Anything is possible
in this place.

360
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,625
Here we can
achieve greatness.

361
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,541
In a way that we
couldn't anywhere else.

362
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,625
So you see.

363
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,250
You think you're
human beings?

364
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,375
You're just samples.

365
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,958
That's what Academy
City was made for!

366
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,708
I'll stop you...
for the sake of my city!

367
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,958
That was nice work.

368
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,708
You saved all
our lives, Saten.

369
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,083
Is that it?

370
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,791
Yes.

371
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,333
The program is complete.

372
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,291
And now.

373
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,333
Go on, it's all right.

374
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,833
Banri spoke to me.

375
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,791
She wanted me
to tell you.

376
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,416
"I trust you, teacher."

377
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Teacher...?

378
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,791
You look tired...

379
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,083
Why do you have those dark
circles under your eyes?

380
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,708
I... I've just been very busy.

381
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,708
There was so
much work to do.

382
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,166
Oh, yeah.

383
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,666
And you know what...?

384
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,541
Your hair's longer.

385
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,166
It's her, though.

386
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,708
That's our teacher.

387
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,333
It's Miss Kiyama.

388
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,291
She's here!

389
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,958
My children are all awake.

390
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,833
Hey, Erii.

391
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,791
I want to thank you...

392
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,708
for hearing my voice.

393
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,500
You're a true friend.

394
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,375
Yeah!

395
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,250
All right...

396
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,625
can I finish
saying it now?

397
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,041
Thank you so much.

398
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:39,666
[Music]

399
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,125
How can I describe it best?

400
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,000
A battle of singular heroism!

401
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,958
Of course, it didn't
take long for Shirai

402
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,166
to lose her nerve
and run away...

403
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,000
but I wasn't about
to let that stop me.

404
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,833
I stood firm, facing
the enemy head--on,

405
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,375
defeating them easily.

406
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,041
Wow! Then you were the
one who finally put an end

407
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,208
to all the dreadful
poltergeisting

408
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,416
that was happening?

409
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,041
Oh, was it really
you, Kongo?

410
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,166
We should have known!

411
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,083
When is it coming?

412
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,833
Any moment now.

413
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,833
Aw, man, I can't wait!

414
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:07,875
So, where are they?

415
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,083
Uiharu and the others.

416
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,833
She said they would be
along in just a minute

417
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,375
and we should go on ahead.

418
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,625
They're running later
than I thought, though.

419
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,791
I hope they make it.

420
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:17,958
This is a special day.

421
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,791
We have to hurry!
I don't want to miss it!

422
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,458
Misaka, Shirai, it's
unlike you to be late.

423
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,750
What's gotten into you?

424
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,750
Honestly! Of all days, Sissy,

425
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,041
this is the one you
choose to sleep in on?

426
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,416
Shut up...!

427
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,625
You were sleeping every
bit as soundly as I was!

428
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,708
I have to admit,
I'm kinda surprised.

429
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,416
I would never have
expected Misaka

430
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,916
to come up with
something like this.

431
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,500
What are you
talking about?

432
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,666
It's sweet and generous
and thoughtful,

433
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,791
just like Misaka is.

434
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:44,875
Yeah...

435
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,916
I don't think
I'd go that far.

436
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,708
Hello, Shirai?

437
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:55,041
Oh...? You haven't
gotten there yet?

438
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,791
No, I don't need anything
from you guys right now.

439
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,083
Just calling
to let you know

440
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,083
that you--know--who's
regained consciousness.

441
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,666
We've begun
interrogating her,

442
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,500
but I don't think she's
going to give much up easily.

443
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,458
Yeah, I agree.

444
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:08,541
All right.

445
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,708
Thanks for
letting me know.

446
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:11,958
What is it?

447
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,416
It's going to be
a long time before

448
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,041
we have a full account
of Therestina's crimes.

449
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,750
Hey! What are we
doing standing around?

450
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,000
We need to hurry!

451
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,708
Look...! Up there!

452
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,166
-Hey, it's here!
-Look, there it is!

453
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,541
Where?

454
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,041
-Look!
-That's so cool!

455
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,791
Okay. One, two, three...

456
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,708
Ready, go!

457
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,166
We just wanted to say...

458
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,708
Happy birthday
Miss Kiyama!

459
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,625
Rest up and get
well soon, okay?

460
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,583
-We'll do the same!
-I can't wait to see you again!

461
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:56,666
Me, neither!

462
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,625
Bye for now, Teacher...

463
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,166
Thank you so much!

464
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,166
We love you!

[Music]

466
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,875
There's never a dull
moment, is there?

467
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,625
Not in this city.
