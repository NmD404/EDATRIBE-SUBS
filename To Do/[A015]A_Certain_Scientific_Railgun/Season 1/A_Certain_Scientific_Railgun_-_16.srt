1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,541
It's been a long time Mii.

2
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,666
Kurozuma.

3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,583
You're really alive.

4
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,125
It looks that way.

5
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,875
But why?

6
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,000
Why didn't you contact me.

7
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,916
All this time, not
a word from you...!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,833
I thought... you were dead.

9
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,875
Don't worry about me.

10
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,708
I can easily
disappear again.

11
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,000
Come back!

12
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,583
Please don't go.

13
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:14,875
[Music]

14
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,125
So Konori and Kurozuma
know each other?

15
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,541
Mm--hmm.

16
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,791
She hasn't
explained exactly

17
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,833
how they're
acquainted, though.

18
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,291
But I thought Kurozuma
was part of that gang.

19
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,375
He's supposedly the
boss of Big Spider.

20
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,666
According to
our information.

21
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,166
It makes no sense.

22
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,958
How would she know
someone like that?

23
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,916
She wouldn't be
friends with a guy

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,791
who goes around
attacking girls!

25
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,958
Oh... um...
that's not him...

26
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,708
This is a different
Kurozuma...

27
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,083
How do I explain it...?

28
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,500
It's like, uh...

29
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,250
You wanna chime in...?

30
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,500
I could use some help
clarifying this thing.

31
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,500
People connect in
mysterious ways sometimes.

32
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,041
When it comes to
situations like this,

33
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,833
I find it best to remain
a silent observer.

34
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,333
Oh, man, this
is bugging me!

35
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,375
Why does it have to
be so confusing?!

36
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,916
Maybe I'll just go
straight to Konori

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,500
and ask her about it myself.

38
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,750
Good luck.

39
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,500
Nobody's seen her
for a few days now.

40
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,625
She hasn't shown
up at the branch.

41
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,333
-Not at all?
-Nope...

42
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,708
and I can't get through to
her on her cell, either...

43
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,416
It's weird for
her to disappear

44
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,458
when we're in the middle
of a big case like this.

45
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,916
Fretting about her vanishing
act won't do us any good...

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,708
We're not going to
find any answers

47
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,000
by sitting here all day.

48
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,875
It's time for us to take
this show on the road.

49
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,416
What are you
talking about?

50
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,583
The road to where?

51
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,666
Coming!

52
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,916
Hello. Who are you?

53
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,708
Oh, um...

54
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,083
We were looking
for Mii Konori,

55
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,833
but maybe we got the
wrong place... Sorry.

56
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,041
Oh, you're junior
Judgment officers...

57
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,416
Sorry. I'm afraid
you're out of luck.

58
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,666
Mii isn't here right now.

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,291
Oh... she isn't?

60
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,000
I wanted to hear more about
this Kurozuma character.

61
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,541
Yeah... that's a real shame.

62
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,416
All right, then.

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,708
We'll try again later...

64
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,208
Sorry to bother you.

65
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,000
Wait... don't go.

66
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,375
What am I gonna
do with her?

67
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,625
Making all of you
worry along with me.

68
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,083
It's okay. Thanks.

69
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,875
So then...

70
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,541
Kurozuma has
returned, has he?

71
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,291
He's still alive
after all this time.

72
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,333
Then you know
who Kurozuma is?

73
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,500
Can you tell us how he and
Konori know each other?

74
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,083
Just slow down a second...

75
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,666
Maybe you could tell me
more about yourselves first.

76
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,708
I see.

77
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,416
Then it's no wonder.

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,250
So... anyway...

79
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,958
It would be great
if you'd tell us about

80
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,958
Konori's past involvement
with Kurozuma...

81
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,458
We don't know
anything really,

82
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,750
but I thought maybe she
apprehended him sometime before?

83
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,291
No, you're wrong
about that...

84
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,750
Very wrong...

85
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,250
You see, Mii was actually
part of Big Spider once.

86
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,833
No way...! Impossible!
I don't believe it.

87
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,875
Neither do I. She's a
senior member of Judgment!

88
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,625
You must be mistaken!

89
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,083
That's who she is now...

90
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,208
But she used to have a
little bit of a wild streak.

91
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,333
She had a wild streak??

92
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,416
I hate to speak out of
turn about somebody's past,

93
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,750
but it makes
no sense to me.

94
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,250
Wild child or not,

95
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,791
the fact remains that Konori
is a Level Three esper...

96
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,500
She could've become involved in
any number of organizations.

97
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,916
With so many
options open

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,291
why in the world would
she choose to run

99
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,000
with a group of non--espers
like Skill--Out?

100
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,458
It's not as
simple as that...

101
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,000
Have you ever hit a wall
when it came to your ability?

102
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,250
She had a difficult time
trying to get past hers,

103
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,708
and the depression became
too much to handle.

104
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,666
Back then things
were hard for her.

105
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,416
She felt like no
matter where she went,

106
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,083
she didn't belong.

107
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,166
One day that changed.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,083
She found a
group of people

109
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,041
who made her
feel less alone.

110
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,958
Skill--Out was
a gang, true...

111
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,375
but they did nothing more
harmful than hang out together

112
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,041
and goof around
a little bit.

113
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,291
Honestly...

114
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,250
I was worried
at first, too.

115
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,041
She was intentionally
hiding the fact

116
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,666
that she was an
esper from them...

117
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,208
It didn't seem
right somehow.

118
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,250
But...

119
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,041
"Big Spider is the
first place I've found

120
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,625
where I've felt
free to be myself."

121
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,000
So she said...

122
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,333
and I believed her.

123
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,833
Being yourself.

124
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,625
Alienation...

125
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,375
self--discovery...

126
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,208
Everyone who lives
in Academy City

127
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,791
is sure to experience
those at some point.

128
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,250
It's a fact of life here,
like chicken pox.

129
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,791
The problem with that is you
only catch chicken pox once.

130
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,166
What's wrong, Sissy?

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,750
-Yo.
-Oh. Hey...

132
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,041
I was just...

133
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:46,333
So, Mii... word on the street
is you're a Level Two.

134
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,375
If that's true,
you shouldn't be here.

135
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,250
Let me stay!

136
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,791
I don't have anywhere
else to go...

137
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,083
Please don't make me!

138
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,500
I guess espers have
problems of their own, huh?

139
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,125
Well... okay then.

140
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,500
However...

141
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,416
What're you going
to do next year...?

142
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,958
And the year after that?

143
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,125
Just something you might
want to be thinking about.

144
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,458
What now?

145
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,708
I don't get it.

146
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,791
What don't you get?

147
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,166
It's bad enough already

148
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,416
that Konori used to be
a member of Skill-- Out.

149
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,166
But now she's missing all
of this Judgment work, too.

150
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,791
The two things
seem related.

151
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,125
I'm sure Konori is-

152
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,541
She's past all that...

153
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,833
Whatever happened before,

154
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,125
Konori's a hard--working
member of Judgment now.

155
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,708
She's strict sometimes,
that's true...

156
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,083
but she's still
nice to us...

157
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,625
and she's dependable.

158
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,458
That's the Konori we know.

159
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,583
So why is she behaving
like this now?

160
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,250
I have a feeling it's
not as cut and dried

161
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,333
as you make it sound, Misaka.

162
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,458
Just like everybody,
who Konori is,

163
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,500
is a result of who she was.

164
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,541
Besides, it sounds like
that part of her past

165
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,833
has special meaning to her...

166
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,208
and is hard to let go.

167
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,208
No...! It's not
like that, I swear!

168
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,958
I'm not trying to side
against you, Misaka!

169
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,583
Anyway.

170
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,125
I just don't get it.

171
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,291
What gives...?

172
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,875
Where is everybody?

173
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,458
What do you expect
after what happened?

174
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,166
Not many guys wanted
to hang around.

175
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,041
Yeah, I guess so.

176
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,875
Hey... does this mean the
Kurozuma we know is an imposter?

177
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,458
There's no way he is...!

178
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,708
Kurozuma is still
the same guy we knew!

179
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,125
Yeah... but if that's true,

180
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,250
why'd he look
so spooked

181
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,750
when the guy called
him Hebitani?

182
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,291
You saw that too, huh?

183
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,708
Hard to miss...

184
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,041
He almost looked scared.

185
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,208
What was that?

186
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,750
Who almost looked scared?

187
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,541
Oh... hey, Kurozuma.

188
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,833
You've got time
on your hands

189
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,541
to stand around
here doubting me?

190
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,041
Then you have time
to get out there,

191
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,000
find that poser,
and kill 'im!

192
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,583
There isn't enough
room in Academy City

193
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,875
for two Wataru Kurozumas.

194
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,000
Just me!

195
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,083
-R... Right!
-Okay, let's move!

196
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,166
-Let's go!
-Come on, hurry it up!

197
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,500
Faster, idiots!

198
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,083
Yeah, hello?

199
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,666
Who else would it be?

200
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,375
Huh?... The Capacity
Down system...?

201
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,541
Yeah... we're using the
hell out of it, all right.

202
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,750
Oh, shut up...!

203
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,625
Things are a big
mess here, too.

204
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,333
We don't have time
for esper hunting now!

205
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,875
What did you just say?

206
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,916
She looks sad.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,708
Has Misaka been
like that for long?

208
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,458
Oh yeah... all day.

209
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,500
Hey, guys...

210
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,625
I've got an email
from Antiskill.

211
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,916
Let's see here...

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,750
"To counteract the esper
hunts by Skill--Out,

213
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,625
Antiskill headquarters
will be mobilizing tomorrow.

214
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,125
At ten a.m.,
units will move into

215
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,791
School District Ten, Area G,

216
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,708
commonly known as Strange.

217
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,625
It will be a
comprehensive sweep."

218
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,750
Mii... you forgot something.

219
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,666
I knew this is
where you would be.

220
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,916
Misaka...

221
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,833
So, Konori, what are
you doing up here...?

222
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,333
No, don't tell me.

223
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,875
You've come to warn Kurozuma

224
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,375
about the comprehensive sweep
that's happening tomorrow.

225
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,041
Let's go, Konori.

226
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,166
This isn't the
place for you.

227
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,083
You have to know that.

228
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,833
Yeah you're right.

229
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,000
This isn't the place
for me anymore.

230
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,625
I realize that...

231
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:06,625
but do you know
who helped me

232
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,541
figure it out in
the first place?

233
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,125
It was Kurozuma.

234
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,291
It's too dangerous!
Please don't go!

235
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,041
I understand
how you feel...

236
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,041
but I can't very well
abandon Hebitani.

237
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,458
Even when it's obvious
you're walking into a trap?

238
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,583
About that talk
we had earlier.

239
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,833
I have to tell you,

240
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,500
I really don't think
this is the rooftop

241
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,500
where you should be
leaving your name.

242
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,166
Sorry, Mii.

243
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,708
He's gone.

244
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,166
By the time I arrived
on the scene...

245
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,750
And here I am...

246
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,250
Back up on this
roof again.

247
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,083
But... you can still leave.

248
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,416
You have to think
this through.

249
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,541
You're a senior
Judgment officer now...

250
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,958
That means it
isn't right for you

251
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,625
to let criminals get away...

252
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,166
-Shouldn't you be...
-Yeah...

253
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,500
that would be wrong,
wouldn't it?

254
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,708
You came.

255
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,375
It's really been
two years, huh?

256
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,791
Hard to believe...

257
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,458
After it happened I
woke up in a hospital...

258
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,833
From there, I was sent to
a treatment facility...

259
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:35,875
and I didn't get
out of there

260
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,916
until about six months ago.

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,541
All this time...

262
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,125
I never...

263
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,291
It's still nice
up here, huh?

264
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,833
I thought I would never
get to see the view

265
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,291
from this roof again.

266
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,833
I also thought it
would be better

267
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,666
if I didn't see you
again, either.

268
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,916
-I know what you'll say.
-What?

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,958
That it's stupid for you
to go in on your own?

270
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,208
Like you did last time?

271
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,291
I'm the one who first
created Big Spider.

272
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,666
I should be the one
to bring it down...

273
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,583
Not Antiskill.

274
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,041
No, don't go!

275
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,583
You haven't
changed at all...!

276
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,458
You're still putting
others before yourself,

277
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,833
no matter what the
cost might be to you.

278
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,208
I couldn't stop you
last time. But now...!

279
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,833
You're the same way,
aren't you?

280
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,666
That's why you're
standing here right now...

281
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,041
Well... you should
really get going...

282
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,458
Go on...

283
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,458
She's just standing there,
waiting patiently for you.

284
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,250
So long.

285
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,333
Try to cherish the place
where you belong now.

286
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm coming with you...

287
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,541
I... I can't go
through that again.

288
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,708
Enough already Mii.

289
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,875
Just let it go...

290
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,958
It's not like it
was last time, okay?

291
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,541
For either of us.

292
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,458
What used to be has
nothing to do with it!

293
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,375
The place where I belong
may have changed,

294
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,166
but the way I feel hasn't!

295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,708
-Can I ask you something?
-Hmm?

296
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,750
Time's gonna pass, right...?

297
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,000
And we're bound
to change some.

298
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,708
But do you think some
feelings may stay the same,

299
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,958
no matter what?

300
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,666
I think if your feelings for
somebody are strong enough,

301
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,166
then they don't change,
even if you do.

302
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,416
Instead...

303
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Those feelings keep growing
with every day you live...

304
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,125
Past and present
mingle together

305
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,791
to make you who you are.

306
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,791
The past and
the present...

307
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,625
It may sound presumptuous

308
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,458
but in the short time
we've known each other...

309
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,083
I feel like we've
built something

310
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,916
that isn't going to fade away
just because we get older.

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I see.

312
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,625
We're friends no
matter what...

313
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,541
and we're going to keep
building on that friendship

314
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,000
every day.

315
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,958
You know what, Kuroko?

316
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,041
I have a small
favor to ask of you.

317
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,541
We are preparing to
launch a general sweep.

318
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,166
Target is District
Ten, Area G,

319
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,708
also known as "Strange."

320
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,875
Move out!

321
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,291
You two again?

322
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,958
Why are you here?

323
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,625
Wh-?! Hey!
What are you doing?

324
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,916
There.

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,041
Now that's what
I'm talking about!

326
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,916
You brought my armband.

327
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But how did you...?

328
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,000
You know, Konori...

329
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,791
I think that
look suits you.

330
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,625
You're certainly busy for
this hour of the morning.

331
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,333
I've come to put
an end to this.

332
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,791
Him again...!
The guy from before!

333
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,875
Why, you little...

334
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,791
I'm sure you know
this already,

335
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,791
but I have a talent
for fighting.

336
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,416
Yeah... I know how good
you are in a fight...

337
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,916
but then...

338
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,166
Espers are pretty good at
fighting, too, aren't they?

339
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,041
And they've proven no match
for our numbers and weapons.

340
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,583
Hold it!

341
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,750
Mii...?

342
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,500
You're looking good today.

343
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,916
Is that you, Konori?!

344
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,416
Hebitani.

345
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,166
You've become
quite the scumbag

346
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,125
since the last time we met,
haven't you...?

347
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,625
Relying on your
minions and weapons

348
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,083
to win your battles for you.

349
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,791
Please...! You dumb brat...

350
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,250
You don't know anything!

351
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,541
You turned your back on us
and joined up with Judgment.

352
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,041
Go on...! Show these two just
how much we're capable of!

353
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,250
Hello there.

354
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,083
I'll be happy to stick
these into your bodies

355
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,083
if that would be quicker.

356
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,583
Esper...! Hah...

357
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,875
we've still got our ways
of dealing with you!

358
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,125
Oh, yeah?

359
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,500
You mean that thing?

360
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,708
You didn't really think

361
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,125
we'd fall for the same
trap twice, did you?

362
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,125
You must be stupider
than you look.

363
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,916
Kill the girl!

364
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,750
Y... you can't be serious...

365
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,750
but that's the
Railgun of Tokiwadai!

366
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,958
I said kill her!

367
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,666
If you wanna live, you'd
better follow my orders!

368
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,666
I want you two to
stay out of this.

369
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,958
Please, respect your
elders for once, okay?

370
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,708
Go on... do it!

371
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,208
Come on, boys...

372
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,291
This is sad.

373
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,833
You've gotta put
some heart into it...

374
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,500
or else it won't
be a challenge!

375
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,125
I'll be taking that...
and this, too.

376
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,583
You don't need a
stun gun, do you?

377
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,458
Hey, how...

378
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,041
So that's your
ability, is it?

379
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,750
Feels good to use it, huh?

380
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,166
Sure does.

381
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,166
I'm not gonna let you
have all the fun, though!

382
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,708
Now then...
what'll it be?

383
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,500
You really think you've
beaten us, don't you?

384
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,541
You're wrong...
Take a look at this!

385
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,125
Dynamite?!...

386
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,083
Who uses something that
old school anymore?

387
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,291
Go on. I dare you
to come closer...

388
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,291
I'll blow us
all sky--high.

389
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,666
Well? What's the matter...?

390
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,166
Are you scared now?

391
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,750
What a pain.

392
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,250
No... stay back...!

393
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,666
I'll blow us up.

394
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,250
Ah, Hebitani...

395
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,666
We had some good times
together, didn't we?

396
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,041
Stand still...!Not
one step more!

397
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,208
We all used to hang out,
just because it was fun.

398
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,625
What happened to that?

399
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,458
Stay there.

400
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,708
Stop.

401
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,125
What happened to you?

402
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,875
What changed?

403
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,000
I... I had no choice...

404
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,625
What else could
I have done?

405
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,250
This is the only place
where we belong...

406
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,458
I had to find a way to
keep Big Spider together...

407
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,041
and that could only happen
if I became Kurozuma.

408
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,416
And that's why...

409
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,125
I have no choice but to get
rid of you once and for all!

410
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,750
Hebitani...

411
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,666
This isn't where
you belong.

412
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,833
Your place is wherever
you can be yourself.

413
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,125
Haven't you
realized that yet?

414
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,583
Well... I'm glad
that's over, at least...

415
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,750
Now...

416
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,666
Here.

417
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,416
Mii...

418
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,208
Wataru Kurozuma ...

419
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,666
On behalf of Judgment,

420
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,125
I am placing you under arrest
for suspicion of assault.

421
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:02,916
That looks good on you.

422
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,750
I have to say...

423
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,666
It does look a little
tight in the bust area,

424
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,791
if you know what I mean.

425
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,750
Yes, well. That's because
I drink it every day.

426
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,916
When it comes to milk...

427
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,791
It's gotta be Musasino!

428
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,791
There he goes,
talking about breasts,

429
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,166
just like he was before.

430
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,041
And somehow, it's
still not offensive.

431
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,041
Kurozuma...

432
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,250
Thank you.

433
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:40,041
[Music]

434
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,250
The breeze up here really
does feel incredible,

435
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,500
don't you think so?

436
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,416
Oh, so that's it, Sissy.

437
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,458
I was wondering why you wanted
to come all the way up here.

438
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,708
Oh, look.

439
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,750
Somebody's scrawled
graffiti on this railing.

440
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,583
"Mii... Kuro."

441
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,958
Wonder what it means.

442
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,750
It means that
no matter what,

443
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,083
there are some feelings
that don't change...

444
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,041
It means someone cares
about someone else.

445
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,208
Academy City at its best.

446
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,666
I'll never forget the things
you showed me, Kuro...

447
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,041
The soft caresses, the
twilight strolls, the...

448
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,583
Hey, what's with this?

449
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,541
That didn't happen!

450
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,125
We call that payback.
