1
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,750
Oh, hi there, Tesso.

2
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,416
Still hard at
work, I see...

3
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,583
even during
summer vacation.

4
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,166
Yeah, I still had some loose
ends that needed tying up.

5
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,416
Quite the busy little
bee, aren't you?

6
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,041
Yeah...

7
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,666
Ah! It's that late already?!

8
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,375
You have to work at your
other job today, too?

9
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,583
And I need to hurry!

10
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,750
See you later!
Have a good day!

11
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, be careful
out there.

12
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:27,166
Ow--ow--ow!

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,958
I really don't
have time for this!

14
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:29,958
No I'm serious.

15
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,708
Be very careful.

16
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,083
Oh! The train!

17
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,166
Wait for me!!

18
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,958
Why do these things
always happen to me?!

19
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:08,000
[Music]

20
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,708
Sorry, I know I'm late!

21
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,916
No kidding.... You're
good and late, aren't you?

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,583
R--really sorry.

23
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,375
Students get restless when
they're on summer vacation...

24
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,791
Judgment has a hard time
maintaining discipline

25
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,250
in the city on their own,

26
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,583
so we've been called in
to assist whenever we can.

27
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,041
You're late. Now get over it
and pull yourself together.

28
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,000
Right... I will.
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,458
Honestly.

30
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,583
Yes, Yomikawa...

31
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,666
A robbery?

32
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,125
Roger that......

33
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,083
Make up for your mistake
by doing well today.

34
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,166
Got it?

35
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,791
Yes!

36
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,833
Can you help me,
please, Yomikawa?!

37
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,250
All of you,
just stay back!

38
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,833
Come any closer
and I'll kill 'er!

39
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,166
Forget about me...
Take him down.

40
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,666
-What should we do?
-Keep quiet!

41
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,708
Let me have that.

42
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,750
Ma'am?

43
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,041
Don't think I won't do it!

44
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,833
Excellent!

45
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,958
I'm in the zone!

46
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,708
Well, that was a
pathetic display.

47
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,458
Huh?... She got the all--time
high score. That's impressive!

48
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,958
It wasn't too shabby,
I'll grant you that.

49
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,625
But... Wait 'til
you see me go!

50
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on.

51
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,416
The hostages had
been rescued,

52
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,833
so you let your guard down...

53
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,833
Look where that got you.

54
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,166
I didn't think
he'd move so fast.

55
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,458
Excellent!

56
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,833
I did it!

57
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,041
You beat my high score?

58
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,291
That's incredible, Saten.
Good job!

59
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,666
Well look at that. It's
almost time for school curfew.

60
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,416
Yep, just about.

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,166
Go in there
and do your job.

62
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,416
Make up for your mistakes
by working hard, remember?

63
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,333
Oh... right.

64
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,625
This time I'm gonna
hit it like I mean it.

65
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,750
Oh, so now you're saying

66
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,666
you didn't give it
your all last time?

67
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,875
Please, don't get carried away
and start kicking and stuff.

68
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,750
Oh...! I didn't
know I could!

69
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,916
But you shouldn't.
That would be cheating.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,625
Hey... that's it for today.

71
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,666
Time's up. It's going to be
school curfew any minute now...

72
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,000
You four should hurry
on back to your dorms.

73
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,125
Oh, hey...

74
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,666
I recognize her.

75
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,458
You're those girls...

76
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,541
We were in a tight spot,
and you helped us. Thank you.

77
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,375
I should be thanking you
for all the help you gave us.

78
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,166
You know, you look a lot
skinner than I remember.

79
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,625
If I had to guess,
I'd say it's due to exhaustion.

80
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,833
Oh? I don't think so...

81
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:41,875
No, she's right.

82
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,041
You're as pale as a ghost.

83
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,208
You should take better
care of your skin.

84
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,000
You guys over in Antiskill
must have it really rough, huh?

85
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,666
Yeah, that's the truth.

86
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,666
What do you say?

87
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,708
Want to give it a try?

88
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,583
It's an excellent
stress reliever.

89
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,708
I don't think so.
I'm still on duty.

90
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,166
Who knows, it might do
wonders for your skin, too.

91
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,625
Well... maybe I could
play just one game...

92
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,666
Games aren't in your
job description...

93
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,583
Now, get moving, girls.
Back to your dorm rooms.

94
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,833
It's the scary teacher
from the workshop.

95
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,458
Come on, move
it...! Curfew!

96
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,375
Everybody outta here!

97
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,416
You heard me.

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,291
Go on.

99
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,375
Huh?

100
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,583
That's Konoe.

101
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,083
Friend of yours?

102
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,083
No, not really.
He does go to our school,

103
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,833
but we don't know
him all that well.

104
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,916
He's kind of the
unapproachable type, you know?

105
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,291
Ow! That really hurts!

106
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,583
What's the matter
with you, Tesso?

107
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,708
Oh, the hot water stings the
spots where I got scraped up.

108
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,208
I'm not talking
about that...

109
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,666
I wanna know what was the
matter with you today...

110
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,250
First you were late, then
you got yourself taken hostage,

111
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,166
and then you were manipulated
by a group of young students.

112
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,625
Yeah...

113
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,250
I can't say you were always
the best Antiskill officer,

114
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,916
but today was a
particularly poor showing.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,208
I know. Sorry.

116
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,250
Well... Whatever
else happened today,

117
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,916
a nice, hot bath is
always a great way

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,708
to finish a long day of work.

119
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,125
Yeah, it sure is.

120
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,125
Komoe thinks so, too.
Isn't that right?

121
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,125
Hey, Pops, an
order of gizzards!

122
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,041
Here ya go.

123
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,083
Hard--drinking
as ever, huh...?

124
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,916
Well, here's to you!

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,416
-Now, Tsuzuri Tesso!
-Uh... yes?

126
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,000
Listen to me!
Your problem is

127
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,833
that you're a wimpy
little insect...

128
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,083
You gotta hold
your head high.

129
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,458
Sometimes you gotta give
life a hard smack in the face.

130
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,083
A good, hard smack!

131
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,541
That's right. Sometimes a
girl's got no other choice.

132
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,416
Ah! That's enough!

133
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,208
Hey, Pops. How 'bout
some liver steaks?

134
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,166
Here ya go.

135
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,916
A hard smack... huh?

136
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,958
I will try harder.

137
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,541
Today's patrol is from
Area A through D...

138
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,083
Let's split up
and get to it.

139
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,416
Are you ready, Tesso?

140
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,291
Yes!

141
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,958
Let's see...

142
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:29,416
That way is north,
so that means...

143
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,000
Where did you get separated
from your mommy, little one?

144
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,125
Nothing is going
right today.

145
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,041
It's that boy.

146
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,416
Here I go.

147
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,500
You there.

148
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,791
Have you looked
at a clock lately?

149
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,041
It's almost curfew...

150
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,916
You need to pack it
up and head home.

151
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,666
Hey, are you
listening to me?

152
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,291
Gekisho 9!

153
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,916
I wouldn't think they'd
have an old classic game

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,125
like this in
Academy City.

155
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,833
It sure takes
me back, though!

156
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,750
I used to play
this a lot...

157
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,458
They never did come
out with ten, did they?

158
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,791
K.O.!!

159
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,875
Anyway, enough of that.

160
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,125
It's time for
you to get going.

161
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,166
Hey, you...!

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,958
Pig's trotters,
please, Pops!

163
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,666
Here ya go.

164
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,291
Let's add on some shrimp cakes
and bamboo shoot sashimi, too.

165
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,291
Here ya go.

166
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,708
-Hey, Tesso...
-Yeah?

167
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,750
You know, if something's
bothering you, I'm all ears...

168
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,041
It's okay,
you can tell me.

169
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,333
Oh, goodie! Are we
talking about boys?

170
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,375
Thank you, but nothing's
really bothering me.

171
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,416
Oh, really? Then why do you keep
screwing things up all the time?

172
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,833
I dunno. Sorry.

173
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,208
How does it go...?

174
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,333
Something along the lines of

175
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,375
"Gather ye rosebuds
while ye may."

176
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,500
She's right, Tesso.

177
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,666
Your life shouldn't
be all about work.

178
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,208
Maybe what you
need is a hobby...

179
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,083
Do something you enjoy
every once in a while,

180
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,916
and you won't be
so burned out.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,750
Something I enjoy.
Like what?

182
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,291
Summer's the best time for a
young woman to find herself!

183
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,500
Cut loose!
Run wild!

184
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,166
Anything goes!
The sky's the limit!

185
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,041
Yeah...! Go nuts!

186
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,416
Go nuts, huh?

187
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,083
Yes, you're right. Thanks.

188
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,208
Good!

189
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,041
Pops, give us
something special.

190
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,333
Here ya go.

191
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,916
Um, Komoe...

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,250
there's something I've been
meaning to ask you for a while.

193
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,250
Okay, shoot.

194
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,083
Uh... what kind of
restaurant is this, exactly?

195
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,958
You're gonna be late again...?

196
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,750
What in the world
are you doing?

197
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,083
Well, you see...

198
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,500
I haven't gotten my term
evaluations filed yet.

199
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,416
What? Those are
supposed to be finished

200
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
before summer
vacation starts!

201
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,125
Yeah, I'm sorry.

202
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,333
Geez, what am I
gonna do with you...?

203
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,000
All right, you don't
have to come in.

204
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,250
Get your work done so this
doesn't happen anymore.

205
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,583
Yes ma'am!

206
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,541
One more thing... the next
time we go out drinking,

207
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,416
it's your treat.

208
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,583
Right!

209
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,958
All done!

210
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,916
It's a lot later
than I thought.

211
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,958
Something I enjoy...

212
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,125
well...

213
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,416
K.O.!!

214
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,625
You rely too much
on the big moves.

215
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,708
And you should
really balance

216
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,750
your offense and
defense better too...

217
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,958
If your attacks
aren't well--defined,

218
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,333
you're better
off not making them.

219
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,875
Aren't you...?

220
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,541
I used to be really
into this game...

221
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,000
You mind switching
out with me?

222
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,833
Watch this... All you do is
just press the start button...

223
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,958
Then hit these like so.

224
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,833
Come on...! Bring it!

225
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,000
A hidden character?

226
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,416
Cool, huh...?

227
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,666
Unfortunately this guy's
not all that good, though.

228
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,583
Why are you showing
me all this?

229
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,083
Because I enjoy it...
The game.

230
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,791
You like it, too...

231
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,875
Don't you wanna know
all the secret stuff...?

232
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,875
Besides, look at this guy.

233
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,833
He's kinda cute.

234
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,416
Nope, not even a little.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,916
Are you sure about this...?

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,458
Being Antiskill, and all.

237
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,916
I've got the day off.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,916
My schoolwork is
all done, too.

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,125
I thought it might be nice

240
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,333
to cut loose and relax
for once, you know?

241
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,375
Now then... Let's see
if I've gotten rusty

242
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,583
after all these years.

243
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,333
Komoe's calling.

244
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,458
Yes, hello...? What...?!

245
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,708
There's an emergency
involving Yomikawa?

246
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,375
Uh, yes... okay...

247
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,041
but...

248
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,541
Yomikawa needs my help...

249
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,083
I know... but still...

250
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,125
Jamie!

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,125
Sorry, would you take over?

252
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,875
Oh! And the Jamie ending
is totally awesome,

253
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,666
so make sure you
watch it, okay?

254
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,041
All right, I'm here!

255
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,291
Uh--oh... I think
I drank too much.

256
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,750
This is the emergency
that you needed me for?

257
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,416
Yes. Thanks for coming.

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,250
Isn't it a little
early for this?

259
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,750
Exactly how much did
she drink, Komoe?

260
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,458
Between the both of us,
we had about two gallons.

261
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,583
Hey Tesso...

262
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:18,125
are you enjoying yourself?

263
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,208
How in the world could
I be enjoying this?

264
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,333
Well... what about
the rest of your day?

265
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,708
Huh?

266
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,750
And yesterday...?

267
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,333
And the day before that?

268
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,041
Oh... aside from this,

269
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,333
it's been basically
enjoyable, I guess...

270
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,291
I mean, I've been busy
with work and all...

271
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,791
I make it a point to
enjoy myself every day.

272
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,625
With all the different
students in this city,

273
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,583
life's never dull.

274
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,041
Yeah.

275
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,000
Just recently,
for instance,...

276
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,458
this poor young girl blew
the roof off my place.

277
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,708
Huh?...
She destroyed your roof?

278
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,500
Yes, she did.

279
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,958
But it's all right.

280
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,458
Because I love every
one of my students...

281
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,833
no matter what mistakes
they might make...

282
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,250
and what about you, Tesso?

283
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,583
What is it that you love?

284
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,458
Right.

285
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,375
Today, we've got
areas I through L...

286
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,375
-Let's split up, and...
-That sounds perfect. I'm on it.

287
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,166
I'll start by
patrolling area L.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,958
She's pretty
fired up today.

289
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,791
Come back here!

290
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,125
Stop there, you...!

291
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,166
What kind of automaton
monster are you?!

292
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,541
-Give it back!
-Hey there!

293
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,375
Um. What school do you go to?

294
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,291
I'm not a student here...

295
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm a holy sister!

296
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,083
Okay, so...

297
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,791
What you're saying is
you dropped a donut,

298
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,458
and it was picked up by
the cleaning robot?

299
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,833
Exactly! And I'm well
within my rights.

300
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,125
Toma told me about
the regulation

301
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,208
you have known as the
"three second rule."

302
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,541
I know what you're
talking about,

303
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,625
but I don't think the rule
applies on the street.

304
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,916
Ah...!

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,958
Hey! Give me back my
donut this instant!

306
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,416
Oh. Uh, hey wait!

307
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,083
Oh... kay...

308
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,708
Huh?... I'm sorry, miss, but...

309
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,500
All of them.

310
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,666
All of them?

311
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,041
All of them.

312
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,541
Okay, let me get
this straight...

313
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,125
That girl was
adamant about

314
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,166
buying all the hamburgers
the restaurant had?

315
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,000
Hey.

316
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,750
Can you tell me what
school you go to?

317
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,875
Kirigaoka Girls'...

318
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,541
But I'm on
break right now.

319
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,833
For lunch, right?

320
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,666
And why do you want
so many hamburgers,

321
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,416
if you don't
mind me asking?

322
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,041
They taste incredible...

323
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,750
I must have them all.

324
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,166
Okay...

325
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,250
sure...

326
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,291
Maybe this is too
much for me...

327
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,291
No! I can't give up now.

328
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,666
Forward, march!

329
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,125
What's the matter?

330
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,625
A special necklace
that I had... it's gone.

331
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,916
A lost necklace...?

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,791
Describe it.

333
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,791
It has a photo inside.

334
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,458
Oh, it's a locket, then.

335
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,833
What's a locket?

336
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:08,833
That's what you
call a necklace

337
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,750
you can put a
photo inside of.

338
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,083
What?! Kids don't
call it that anymore?

339
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,125
It's a necklace.

340
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,625
A necklace. Right...

341
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,125
So, uh... did you
lose it around here?

342
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,958
Maybe. Who knows?

343
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,833
Okay. We'll start here.

344
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,083
I'll help you
search for it.

345
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,875
Not there either.

346
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,291
Earthquake!

347
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,875
Hey, was that
an earthquake?

348
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,416
Huh?... Was it...?
I didn't notice.

349
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,166
Oh. Never mind then.

350
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,416
I found it.

351
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,375
You did...?

352
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,833
That's fantastic!

353
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,750
I'm glad it's not
gone for good.

354
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,291
Yeah... Oh, by the way,

355
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,250
can you tell me what
school you go t...

356
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,666
What good am I if I
can't even help some girl

357
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,583
find her locket...?

358
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,000
Is this really the
best that I can do?

359
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,625
She sure is late, huh?

360
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,916
What could she be up to?

361
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,791
Let's do this!

362
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,000
Huh...?
It's another Jamie.....

363
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,541
All right, you don't
stand a chance!

364
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,875
Ready... Go!

365
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,291
This guy's pretty good.

366
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,916
Lariat, huh?!

367
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,333
K.O.!!

368
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,625
Round 2.

369
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,875
Yeah, take that!

370
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,958
They didn't used to call me
Jamie's Empress for nothing!

371
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,375
K.O.!!

372
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,333
I did it...!
We're even!

373
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,916
Final round!

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,375
I'm gonna take this match.

375
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,458
Just watch!

376
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,083
Got 'im!

377
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,666
Time to say goodbye!

378
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,250
K.O.!!

379
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,583
You lose.

380
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,625
I guess I have gotten
rusty, after all.

381
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,291
Oh, well...

382
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,333
For a while there,
I was on fire.

383
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,750
Jamie's Empress, is it?

384
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,458
What? Oh, no! You heard that?

385
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,125
No kidding...?

386
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,375
You really did what I said

387
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,291
and played until you
saw Jamie's ending...?

388
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,625
No wonder you're so good.

389
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,458
Aw, man, I really wish

390
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,250
they would come out
with a Gekisho 10.

391
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,833
They never will not with
an old game like that.

392
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,458
Well, if they do, I have no
doubt I'll beat you on it.

393
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,500
What?

394
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,000
Nothing.

395
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,625
I'll look forward to it...

396
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,958
Your Imperial Majesty.

397
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,958
Didn't I tell you to
forget you heard that?

398
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,166
You can just
leave me here.

399
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,666
What are you
talking about...?

400
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,000
It's past curfew...

401
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,083
A middle--schooler
can't be out on his own.

402
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,333
It's okay.
My place is right over there.

403
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,083
Oh...

404
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,041
Bye.

405
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,583
Um...

406
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,000
Thanks a lot.

407
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,208
-Yes-?
-Where are you?!

408
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,750
You didn't even call!

409
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,000
If you're not coming, the least
you can do is let us know!

410
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,708
Yomikawa worries
about you, Tesso.

411
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,250
Well, I wouldn't say
"worry," exactly...

412
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,208
Anyway... remember
what I told you.

413
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,583
-It's your turn to buy...!
-All right, Pops...

414
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,166
Today I'll take the
entire pig's head!

415
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,750
You'd better hurry
up and get down here!

416
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,833
Yes, ma'am! Coming!

417
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,666
He transferred?

418
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,791
That's what we heard.

419
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,250
It does seem strange,

420
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,208
going in the middle
of summer vacation.

421
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,333
You're right...

422
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,916
It does.

423
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,375
The school he's
transferring to.

424
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,666
What was it called, again?

425
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,958
Zasso Academy Junior High.

426
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,833
I don't recognize
the name at all.

427
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,166
I think I'd remember it.

428
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,041
Zasso is a weird
name for a school.

429
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,458
Here's the thing...

430
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,416
Zasso is a game--making company.

431
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,875
They're the ones who
established the school

432
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,416
in the first place.

433
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,791
They make games?

434
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,625
Yeah, they're famous
for those Gekisho games

435
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,708
that were real popular
a while back.

436
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,666
Oh... I think I
have heard of those.

437
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,833
So then, is the whole
purpose of the school

438
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,375
to train future
game creators?

439
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,375
From what I've heard,
the real technical stuff

440
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,291
doesn't start until
the high--school level...

441
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,291
I wonder why he picked
Zasso, though...

442
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,958
I mean, they're
kinda washed up.

443
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,375
Are they really?

444
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,625
That surprises me...

445
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,291
They made some of
my favorite games.

446
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,500
Yes, but you're a
big dork, Uiharu.

447
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,791
What is it, Tesso...?
You're acting strangely.

448
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,083
Oh, nothing.

449
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,333
All right...

450
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,625
I expect all of you to get
back home before curfew!

451
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,958
Right!

452
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,541
Yes!

453
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,916
I'll do my best!

454
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,208
What's come
over you today?

455
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,583
Come on, let's go...!
Area E is next, right?

456
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,875
No, it's F.

457
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,333
Oh, is it...?
All right, then!

458
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:52,375
[Music]

459
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,625
When I was a little girl,

460
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,333
my mom always told me
"Drink before you speak."

461
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,583
Wait, that wasn't it...
"Think before you speak?"

462
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,166
"Drink before you leap?"

463
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,208
Whatever.
