00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,458
You're not
getting away now.

3
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,500
Hey, hold on just a
second. I'm only...

4
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,083
You might as well give up!

5
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,916
Hey, Misaka!

6
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, Uiharu. Saten.
Hi, guys.

7
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,125
What's up? Did
something just happen?

8
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,125
We heard a loud noise
from this direction.

9
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,333
Eh?

10
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,958
No, it was nothing.

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,958
[Music]

12
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,916
Today is a very
important day.

13
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,416
It's me and Sissy's
anniversary.

14
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,375
It happened exactly
one month ago.

15
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,750
Fate bound us
together as roommates.

16
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,166
I ordered
something special.

17
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,708
Unfortunately it
hasn't arrived yet.

18
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,083
But I still have
one thing to offer.

19
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,791
Me.

20
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,333
A heartfelt anniversary
present gift--wrapped

21
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,125
in nothing other than ...

22
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,500
My birthday suit!

23
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,541
Kuroko!

24
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,666
-What?
-Sissy! You're home at last!

25
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,000
-We're here.
-Also!

26
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,250
I can't believe
I'm in her room.

27
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,541
This is too amazing!

28
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,041
It's so stylish.

29
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,291
Talk about chic!

30
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:56,791
Come and feel this.

31
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,125
The bed's so
soft and fluffy.

32
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,166
-It's very comfortable!
-This is incredible!

33
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,833
Seriously, opening
the door like that?

34
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,666
What were you thinking?

35
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,291
I didn't expect company.

36
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,875
Why did you bring
Uiharu and Saten along?

37
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,125
I happened to run into
them out on the street.

38
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,750
They tagged along with me
while I did some shopping.

39
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,166
Then they said they wanted to
see my dorm, so here we are.

40
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,541
-Shopping?
-Huh?

41
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,208
Just for a little.

42
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,416
It's official!

43
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,791
The girls' dorms at
Tokiwadai are amazing!

44
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,958
I'm green with envy!

45
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,041
And don't forget
the dining room.

46
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,000
It was absolutely
gigantic!

47
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,666
It's not all
that wonderful.

48
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,583
Sissy, why did you choose
today of all days?

49
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,666
My perfect anniversary
plans are ruined!

50
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,041
Oh! But what if ...

51
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,708
I wanted you to witness
this special day.

52
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,041
Exactly one month ago,

53
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,625
fate bound Kuroko and me
together as roommates.

54
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,125
We may be two people,
but we share a single heart.

55
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,041
And so Uiharu, Saten,

56
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,791
I truly hope we have your
blessing on our anniversary.

57
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,708
Here's looking
at you, kid.

58
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,791
Shall we drink?

59
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,375
Um, excuse me, Shirai.

60
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,458
But are you all right?

61
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,625
Oh yes, I'm very
well, thank you.

62
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,333
I'm afraid we don't have much
to offer by way of hospitality,

63
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,458
but please make
yourselves...

64
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,958
Hey, Saten. What are
you doing down there?

65
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,416
Well, when you visit
a friend's home,

66
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,083
it's natural to do some
good--natured snooping,

67
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,458
don't you think?

68
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,625
Hot stuff!

69
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,916
Stop that, Saten!

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,833
You can't just go through
other people's things!

71
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,958
Just what I'd expect
from you, Misaka!

72
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,958
Well, as a matter
of fact...

73
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,333
Those actually
belong to me.

74
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,875
Those are your
panties, Shirai?

75
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,791
These make a very
bold statement.

76
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,750
I would hardly consider
those to be bold.

77
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,375
They're a simple
necessity.

78
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,333
Every lady should have a
pair of black panties.

79
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,375
Well, what about
this pair, then?

80
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,125
Those really
lift the spirit.

81
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,916
I wear them when I
need some cheering up.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,500
And what about this
barely--there thong?

83
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,666
Handy for avoiding lines

84
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,625
when one's clothes
fit very tightly.

85
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,791
A.. And this black mesh,
full--body stocking type--thing?

86
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,166
That's absolutely essential.

87
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,625
It brings out
the supple feline

88
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,166
that hides in the
heart of every woman.

89
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,083
Couldn't you have at least
given me a little warning?

90
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,833
Sorry, I was feeling
overwhelmed.

91
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,750
I needed something to
calm me down a little,

92
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,000
and seeing your ordinary striped
panties helps me to relax.

93
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,416
I don't see what
the big deal is.

94
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,000
It's all just underwear.

95
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,083
And there are other kinds

96
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,166
that you haven't
even gotten to yet.

97
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,250
A pearl--white babydoll
with an open bra

98
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,875
and feminine frills.

99
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,666
A lace teddy with
sexy garter belts.

100
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,291
And also these.

101
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,833
That's good to know.

102
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,666
At least she wears
regular underwear, too.

103
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,208
It's very comforting.

104
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,958
I was beginning to
think I didn't know her.

105
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,041
Sorry.

106
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,250
These are actually mine.

107
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,875
As for you, Kuroko!

108
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,250
Explain yourself!

109
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,458
What is my underwear doing
under your bed, huh?

110
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,166
You've got it
all wrong, Sissy!

111
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,375
Oh, you know what would
be awesome, Misaka?

112
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,083
I'd love to see some old
photo albums if you have any!

113
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,708
Great idea! So would I!

114
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,125
Maybe some pictures from

115
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,750
when you and Shirai
were in grade school?

116
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,458
That would be so
interesting to see!

117
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,041
Wow! How adorable!

118
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,250
Is that from your first
day of elementary school?

119
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,333
That pretty woman next to
you-is she your mother?

120
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,583
Uh, yeah.

121
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,666
What a cute kimono!

122
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,125
You were such a
darling little kid!

123
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,083
You know, I'm a
little surprised.

124
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,375
About what?

125
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,791
It's just-you're this
powerful Level 5, Misaka.

126
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,166
The Ace of Tokiwadai,
an electromaster.

127
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,166
I guess I kinda expected
you to be one of those kids

128
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,166
who get taken away while
they are really young

129
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,083
and immediately
fast--tracked for success.

130
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,916
It wasn't like
that at all.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,083
I wasn't always like this.

132
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,041
I started out as a Level 1.

133
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,250
I was just an
ordinary girl.

134
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,666
Wow.

135
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,583
Cool, let's look at
Shirai's photos next.

136
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,333
I'd be glad to
show you them.

137
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,416
At least, I would be if
I had something to show.

138
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,541
Unfortunately, I don't
have any photo albums

139
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,500
for your viewing pleasure.

140
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,416
I am a girl who believes
in seizing the day.

141
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't like to
dwell in the past

142
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,125
nor do I worry
about the future.

143
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,375
No, not me.

144
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,750
I stay in the present
and savor each moment.

145
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,458
That's the philosophy
I live my life by.

146
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,416
What about this?

147
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,166
No, you can't
look at that!

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,791
Kuroko, you...!
It's a good thing

149
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,958
that you like to live in
the present moment so much,

150
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,208
because right now
I'm thinking

151
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:18,958
you're not going to have
a very enjoyable future!

152
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,291
You've got it all wrong!

153
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,916
Don't you understand
I only made it

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,166
because you mean
so much to me?

155
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,375
Do you not even remember

156
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,333
what an important day
it is today, Sissy?

157
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,625
And here I thought you
brought Uiharu and Saten

158
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,208
so they could
celebrate with us!

159
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,500
What?

160
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,958
Celebrating with
Uiharu and Saten?

161
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,791
Oh, I see what
you're saying.

162
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,791
Then you do remember
what today is, Sissy?

163
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,166
Of course! How silly of me.

164
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,666
Today is the one...
week anniversary

165
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,833
of the day you introduced
me to Saten and Uiharu!

166
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,791
It's unbelievable!

167
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,250
The last seven days have
gone by so quickly!

168
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,625
It seems really crazy that
it's only been a week!

169
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,000
It feels like we've known each
other so much longer than that.

170
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,166
Don't you guys agree?

171
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,291
I'm really glad I
met you two, though.

172
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,750
Why does she treat me
so much differently

173
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,416
from those other two?

174
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,083
I'm starting to feel like
I'm a third wheel here.

175
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,041
We've already been
through a lot together.

176
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,750
Like this little bean.

177
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,333
It's been cast aside and
neglected by its fellow beans

178
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,375
and now it is but a
sad solitary legume.

179
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,375
You know, this is
better than I expected.

180
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,416
Yeah?

181
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,000
That's the liquid sandwich?

182
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,041
Anyway, like I was
saying, Uiharu...

183
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,583
Please, Saten, don't
finish that thought!

184
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,625
You guys're hysterical!

185
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,791
Pipe down, would you?

186
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,083
What's with all
the slurping?

187
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,000
Red beans have feelings
too, you know.

188
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,083
Huh?

189
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,458
Can't you see how
I might be feeling

190
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,250
a little abandoned, here?

191
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,291
Well, uh ...

192
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,666
One week since
you met them?

193
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,791
Don't make me laugh.

194
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,291
One week is nothing.

195
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,458
One month.

196
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,375
That's how long it's
been for us, Sissy.

197
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,083
Today is the one--month
anniversary of when fate decreed

198
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,750
that we would be
bound together!

199
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,416
One whole month, Sissy.

200
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,375
Exactly one month ago,
by some random chance,

201
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,916
you and I became roommates.

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,458
Since then, we've eaten
together and slept together.

203
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,958
Shared each others'
joys and sorrows.

204
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,250
All right here!
In this very room!

205
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,833
But you, you don't
remember, do you?

206
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,625
She seems upset.

207
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,208
It does seem serious.

208
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,333
Maybe we should go and
leave them to talk.

209
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,416
-Kuroko, stop that.
-What is it, Sissy?

210
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,208
You know full well that you
manipulated your way in here.

211
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,458
It wasn't fate or random
chance or anything of the sort

212
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,833
and now you talk about joys and
sorrows and lonely red beans?

213
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,666
You know, I think I just
remembered something urgent

214
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,041
that I need to attend to.

215
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,291
How dare you make
this all sound like

216
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,708
some kind of fairy tale!

217
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,958
I was just altering the
story slightly, that's all.

218
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,583
And in return, I'm going
to alter your face for you!

219
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,083
Maybe I see things
different than you.

220
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,166
It's not like I'm
asking very much.

221
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,083
I just wanted to
celebrate today with you

222
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,250
in one small way, Sissy.

223
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,541
Yes?

224
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,916
I have a delivery.

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,166
It's addressed to a
Miss Kuroko Shirai.

226
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,791
-Is this room two--oh--eight?
-Yes.

227
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,375
Can you tell me what
the delivery is?

228
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,875
It just says
"computer parts."

229
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,125
I shouldn't have
been so worried.

230
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,750
These people know
their business

231
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,083
well enough to be discreet.

232
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,458
What's the name
of the sender?

233
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,500
Ehh, Love and Herbs Premiere
Aphrodisiacs, Limited.

234
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,250
Way to throw discretion
right out the window!

235
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,708
Kuroko, why does this small
celebration you have planned

236
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,708
involve the use
of aphrodisiacs?

237
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,500
-Well, uh ...
-I've been too lenient.

238
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,666
It looks like you're going
to need some harsher punishment

239
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,750
before you learn
to behave yourself.

240
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,166
Now I'm going to fry you

241
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,250
until your appearance
matches your name!

242
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,250
Did you forget that I can
just teleport away from you

243
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,041
whenever I want to?

244
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,708
If this is how
you truly feel,

245
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,958
you leave me no choice.

246
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,250
You will not return the
love I freely offer.

247
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,750
So I'll make sure nobody else
can have your love, either.

248
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,166
Is something wrong, Sissy?

249
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,250
Dormitory Rules, Part 9.

250
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,791
The use of Esper abilities
inside the dormitories

251
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,750
is strictly prohibited.

252
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,083
Surely you haven't
forgotten that, Shirai. Hm?

253
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,333
Good afternoon,
Head Resident,

254
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,083
and might I say you look
quite stunning today.

255
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,250
Naturally, we haven't
forgotten the rules.

256
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,291
We weren't just casually
using our powers.

257
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,708
I assure you,
we had a good reason.

258
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,666
Yes, a very good reason.

259
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,083
Is that so?

260
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,416
There were unavoidable
circumstances, were there?

261
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,458
Yes, that's it exactly.
You see, we...

262
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,666
Too bad.

263
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,833
Kuroko!

264
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,666
If I made allowances for every
so--called emergency situation,

265
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,458
the dorm would fall
into utter chaos.

266
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:41,458
Rule breakers must be punished,
without exception.

267
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,666
That's how order
is maintained.

268
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,291
Don't you think?

269
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,458
Y...

270
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,416
Yes.

271
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,416
Give me a break!

272
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,708
Why should I be stuck
doing this, too?

273
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,041
So I got a little
carried away.

274
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,208
It was no big deal.

275
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,500
This punishment
is unreasonable!

276
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,916
Making me clean this
whole pool by hand?

277
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,708
That's cruel and unusual
by anyone's standards!

278
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,833
Ahhh!

279
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,000
We started in the morning

280
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,875
and it's already
past noon now.

281
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,166
How is it we're not even

282
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,416
a third of the way
done with this yet?

283
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,416
I don't think we're going
to finish it all today.

284
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,333
I totally lucked out!

285
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,166
Here with Sissy
at the pool,

286
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,583
spending quality
time alone together,

287
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,125
working up a good sweat.

288
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,625
This is the perfect opportunity
to get some payback

289
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,583
for yesterday's humiliation.

290
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,833
You know, Sissy ...

291
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,375
When working
under a hot sun,

292
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,208
rehydration is essential to
one's health, don't you think?

293
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,750
Would you like some of this
specially formulated beverage?

294
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,958
Thanks. I'll pass.

295
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,875
Why not? Aren't you thirsty?

296
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, tell me this.

297
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,000
Those computer parts
that you ordered,

298
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,833
they didn't happen to find their
way into that drink did they?

299
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,541
That's what I thought.

300
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,333
Shirai?

301
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,333
Yep. That's Shirai, all right.

302
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,583
We thought that was you,

303
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,958
but what are you
doing down there?

304
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,333
What does it look
like I'm doing?

305
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,833
I'm scrubbing
out the pool.

306
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,333
We see that.
But why?

307
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,208
Because we live in
a cold, cold world,

308
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,875
even during the summer.

309
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,875
What are you
two doing here?

310
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,166
We're members of
the swim club,

311
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,208
so it's our job to check
on the tank filters.

312
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,000
They must be Kuroko's
classmates.

313
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,166
And that means ...

314
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,583
They're actually
younger than me.

315
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,208
Hey, Sissy.

316
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,416
I want you to meet some
classmates of mine.

317
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,208
That's Kinuho Wannai
on the right

318
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,208
and the other's
Ma'aya Awatsuki.

319
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,791
Hey, nice to meet you.

320
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,583
-And this august personage...
-Excuse me.

321
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,625
I think I recognize you.

322
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,083
Are you Misaka?

323
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,166
Huh?

324
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,875
Oh, yeah.
That's me.

325
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,916
I knew it!

326
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,833
Do you remember me at all?

327
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,958
You came to my
rescue a while back.

328
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,333
Some guys were
giving me trouble,

329
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,333
and you dealt with them
like they were nothing.

330
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,000
It was amazing!

331
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,041
Did I do that? It must
have slipped my mind.

332
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,375
Anyway, ever since then,

333
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,125
I've really wanted
to say thank you.

334
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,125
I've heard a lot of
stories about you.

335
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,958
It's an honor to
meet you in person.

336
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,916
That sounds like my
Sissy, all right.

337
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,125
She goes around dealing
with thugs like that

338
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,208
no matter how many times
I tell her not to.

339
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,041
No doubt.

340
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,125
When it starts to get hot,

341
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,833
the weirdoes come out
of the woodwork.

342
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,125
It sounds like you
were incredible.

343
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,375
Absolutely.

344
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,250
You were so cool and
collected the whole time.

345
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,458
No, no, no. It wasn't
a big deal, really.

346
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,750
Wait a sec...

347
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,291
Oh, you guys
are hysterical!

348
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,958
Déjà vu! No, it's
just my imagination.

349
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,166
The incident yesterday
is making me paranoid.

350
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,958
I'm not the
odd--man--out here.

351
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,333
That would be crazy! Right?

352
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,041
Hot as it is, it must be
tough working out here.

353
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,708
I should have a sports
drink in my bag

354
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,000
if you'd like some.

355
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,041
Here, you need
it more than me.

356
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,291
I'd love some.

357
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,708
That's so nice of you.

358
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,791
Why is she excluding
me like this?

359
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,208
Could it be?

360
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,500
Now that I think about it,

361
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,000
this isn't the first time
she's ignored me lately.

362
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,333
I've tried over and over again
to deepen our friendship,

363
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,208
but she keeps
tossing me aside.

364
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,541
It's entirely possible

365
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,041
that Sissy has been deliberately
giving me the cold shoulder.

366
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,625
Suck it up, Kuroko.

367
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,916
You've lost your
confidence,

368
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,250
and you need to get it back.

369
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,375
Forget your anxiety and
play to your strengths.

370
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,333
That's it!

371
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,916
I'm a teleporter,
after all!

372
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,916
There are any
number of ways

373
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,791
I can prove my
worth to Sissy.

374
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,250
I just have to
find the right one.

375
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,750
Wow, incredible!

376
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,458
It's washing away
all the grime.

377
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,625
My ability is manipulating
water currents,

378
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,208
so it's a piece of cake.

379
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,125
We need to finish up our
inspection right now,

380
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,583
but after I've
taken care of that,

381
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,958
I would love to come
back down here

382
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,000
and help you out, if you
wouldn't mind the company.

383
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,000
Huh? I don't know...

384
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,500
It's the least I
can do to repay you

385
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,875
for saving me
from those guys.

386
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,000
Well in that case,
how could a girl say no?

387
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,875
Excellent.
I'm so glad you agreed!

388
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,250
It's amazing!

389
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,541
We'll be done in no
time at this rate.

390
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,083
Thank you so much!

391
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,041
Okay, then. I'll
see you in a bit!

392
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,416
I'll leave the sports
drink here, too,

393
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,750
so you can stay hydrated.

394
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,166
Have as much as you want.

395
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,541
Wow. Those friends of yours
are really nice, Kuroko.

396
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,541
One could say so.

397
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,208
I'm glad they came along.

398
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,125
This will take ten
minutes doing it her way.

399
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,166
One could say so.

400
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,416
Ahhh!

401
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,541
When we're done I wanna
get some ice cream.

402
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,625
One could say so.

403
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,500
I've got a rip in one
of my school uniforms.

404
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,791
What do you think I
should do about it?

405
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,958
One could say "sew."

406
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,416
Is there something wrong?

407
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,791
You seem down or something.

408
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,083
I'm fine. Pay no
attention to me.

409
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,291
Don't trouble yourself
on my account.

410
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,541
I'm a useless teleporter

411
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,416
who can't even clean pools.

412
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,916
Um, Kuroko.

413
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,291
If there's something

414
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,375
that you need to get
off your chest, then...

415
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,416
Thanks, but no thanks!

416
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,708
It's my own fault

417
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,666
for not being worthy of
your affection, Sissy.

418
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,666
I know I'm no help at all.

419
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,666
I just annoy you
all the time.

420
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,708
I see why you've been
acting this way.

421
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,916
Someone like me could
never hope to deserve

422
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,833
somebody as amazing as you!

423
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,333
Great. What do I do?

424
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,500
I don't know how to handle
sudden breakdowns like this.

425
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,875
I'm curious.

426
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,375
I wonder if Misaka's
given it to her.

427
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,625
I don't know, but I sure wish
we could be there when she does.

428
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,000
It seems only fair

429
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,333
since we were with her
when she bought it.

430
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,791
I'm interested to find out
how Shirai will react.

431
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,791
I mean, given her taste
in underwear and all.

432
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,750
Yeah, that was crazy, huh?

433
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,000
I never would
have expected her

434
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,458
to own all that
daring lingerie.

435
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,125
But, you know, it's the
thought that counts, ultimately.

436
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,083
Yeah, that's true.

437
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,458
So, Kuroko.

438
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,333
Do you remember what happened
exactly a month ago today?

439
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,958
-A month ago today?
-That's right.

440
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,208
Don't you remember?

441
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,708
The night that you
broke into my room?

442
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,833
The Head Resident
caught you,

443
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,750
and you got a
good scolding.

444
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,375
Then, the next day

445
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,375
they made the two of us
clean the whole dining hall.

446
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,875
And one thing led to another,
and here we are.

447
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,375
Still together
a month later.

448
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,208
So, if we were going to
have an anniversary

449
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,500
then it would be today,
wouldn't it?

450
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,500
May I open it now?

451
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,875
Yeah, of course.

452
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,625
I plan to be friends
for a long time,

453
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,666
so don't quit on me now.

454
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,750
Do you mean it, Sissy?

455
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,875
A long time?

456
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,458
Like, forever
and ever, maybe?

457
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,208
Well, of course I mean it.

458
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,666
We go to the same school,
and we live in the same room.

459
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,916
We couldn't split
up even if we tried.

460
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,875
After all, we're
partners, right?

461
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,875
Here.

462
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,416
Here's to being partners.

463
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,583
Shall we drink?

464
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,458
Here's to being forever
bound together by fate!

465
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,875
Here's to remaining
roommates and good friends!

466
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,500
All right, then. What do you
say we get back to work?

467
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,958
Right. Back to work.

468
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,125
You know something, Sissy?

469
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,708
I think it would be
better to wear a swimsuit

470
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,250
while you clean the pool.

471
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,166
That way it wouldn't matter
if you got wet, you know?

472
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,708
Yeah, but it would
be too much of a pain

473
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,375
to go back and get it.

474
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,083
Actually, I thought something
like this might happen.

475
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,375
Ta--da!

476
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,041
I brought your school
swimsuit with me

477
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,750
in case of just
such an emergency.

478
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,500
The last time I checked,
that swimsuit was in my locker!

479
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,833
You should know locks don't
mean very much to somebody

480
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,291
who has my
particular abilities.

481
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,166
Now, why don't you go
ahead and put it on, Sissy?

482
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,666
Hey!

483
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,791
How sad. I don't think I've seen
such childish underwear before.

484
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,541
That's enough!
Give them back!

485
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,333
Like I said, put on your
swimsu-Wait a sec...

486
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,833
Oh, my goodness!

487
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,916
This is a bunny,
and this is a bunny, too!

488
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,208
We match!
Me and Sissy match!

489
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,250
Kuroko!

490
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,458
It sounds so lively.

491
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,833
What's going on?

492
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,833
Misaka, we're all finished
up with our inspection,

493
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,625
so we came back to help
out like we promised.

494
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,750
Oh, yes. Hit me again with
your electrified whip of love!

495
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,208
Give them back!

496
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,750
Give them back now!

497
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,250
-I can't do that.
-I'm dead serious.

498
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,625
If I give them back,
you'll stop.

499
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,125
Stop saying that!

500
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,375
Let's pretend we
didn't see anything.

501
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,333
Yeah. That's a good idea.

502
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,583
I'll never get
disheartened again.

503
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,041
Nothing can take
her from me.

504
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,958
We'll be together forever!

505
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,291
[Music]

506
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,750
He loves me,
he loves me not,

507
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:04,666
he loves me,
he loves me not ...

508
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,916
Um, excuse me.

509
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,458
Please stop doing
that, Saten.

510
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,708
That's not what the flowers
on my head are intended for.
