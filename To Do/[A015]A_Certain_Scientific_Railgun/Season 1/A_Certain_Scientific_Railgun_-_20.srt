1
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,166
Was that another earthquake...?

2
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,083
There have been a lot
of those lately.

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,875
Who's there?!

4
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,500
Beware, I am Mitsuko Kongo
of Tokiwadai Middle Scho...

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,416
I heard there was another
earthquake yesterday...

6
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,000
Was your dorm
damaged at all?

7
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,416
No, we were fine...

8
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,666
Fortunately my place didn't
really shake that much.

9
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,541
Hmm... That's strange,

10
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,541
considering you're in
District Seven, and all.

11
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,000
Mr. Daigo...

12
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,291
Can I ask you....
why I'm here?

13
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,791
Oh, of course.

14
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:44,916
Come on in.

15
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,875
A new transfer
student is joining us.

16
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,333
I thought you two
should meet...

17
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,041
since she's going
to be your roommate.

18
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,291
I know it's late notice.

19
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,208
But as our school's
Judgment officer,

20
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,583
we thought you'd be a good
choice to help her get settled.

21
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,041
Oh...! Yes...!
I'll do my best!

22
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,625
Thank you!

23
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,791
I'm Erii Haru'ue.

24
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:16,875
[Music]

25
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,416
A transfer student
from District Nineteen?

26
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,458
That's odd...

27
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,125
In the middle of
the term like this?

28
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,833
Yeah, usually
transfer students

29
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,083
join at the start
of the year,

30
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,333
or at least the
beginning of a term...

31
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,000
What's gotten
into you, Saten?

32
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,458
You seem really
happy about this.

33
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,791
Well, of course I am!

34
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,750
She's going to be Uiharu's
roommate, after all...

35
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,541
That means she'll
be my friend, too.

36
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,666
Hey, Saten!

37
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,708
So, um...

38
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,333
I'd like you to
meet Erii Haru'ue...

39
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,333
And Haru'ue, these
are my friends.

40
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
On the right is
Kuroko Shirai...

41
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,250
Next to her is
Mikoto Misaka.

42
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,041
They both go to Tokiwadai
Middle School...

43
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,416
And that's Ruiko Saten.

44
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,666
She's in our class.

45
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,791
Hello, there...

46
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,208
Uh... if you don't
mind me asking...

47
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,625
Why's all your stuff
just sitting out here?

48
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,458
Oh, yeah...

49
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,791
You see...

50
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,208
I was at the train
station picking up Haru'ue

51
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,333
when we got the call that
the movers were already here

52
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,708
with all of her things.

53
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,708
It wasn't very
considerate of the movers

54
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,166
to just drop
these here and go.

55
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,500
Well, we can't leave
it all sitting here.

56
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,500
I can take care of
that simply enough.

57
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,083
Oh...! Why didn't
I think of that?

58
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,416
Amazing.

59
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,750
I've never seen
teleporting before.

60
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,583
That doesn't
surprise me a bit...

61
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,750
Not to sound immodest,

62
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,208
but there aren't
many teleporters

63
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,958
with my level of power,
even within Academy City.

64
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,958
Okay, okay...!

65
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,916
Now... shall we get
this all put away?

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,041
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

67
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,250
That's the last
of it, huh?

68
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,500
Thank you all...

69
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,583
I really appreciate
you helping me.

70
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,333
It's no big deal, really...

71
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,375
So anyway...

72
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,916
we finished sooner
than expected...

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,291
Let's have some fun, huh?

74
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,500
Agreed!

75
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,541
Don't get too
excited, Uiharu...

76
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,416
Geez, have you already
forgotten...?

77
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,666
We have that joint
conference to attend today.

78
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,416
What conference?

79
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,000
Judgment and Antiskill are
meeting this afternoon.

80
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,083
Supposedly...

81
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,625
it has to do with
all the earthquakes

82
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,583
we've been experiencing
recently.

83
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,875
A conference
on earthquakes?

84
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,708
Yeah. We have to go.

85
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,791
Well... Misaka and I can
still show Haru'ue around.

86
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,500
Without me?
No fair!

87
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,666
It'll be fine.

88
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,791
They can meet up
with us later...

89
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,916
Right?

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,375
It'll be okay...

91
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,666
Saten can be a bit too
much to handle sometimes,

92
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,000
but Misaka's nice...

93
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,875
and we'll join you as
soon as we're finished.

94
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,541
Too much to handle?

95
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,583
Saten, I want you to
promise me something...

96
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,666
Swear you won't flip
up Haru'ue's skirt,

97
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,291
even as a joke, okay?

98
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,583
Huh?... But why would I
do something like that?

99
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,666
Well, uh...

100
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,750
you...

101
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,958
you know...

102
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,958
All right...!
Where should we go now?

103
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,000
Your choice...

104
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,666
Anything special
you want to do?

105
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,416
Oh, well, um...

106
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,875
I don't know this district
well enough to say.

107
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,625
Oh... of course.

108
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,458
Hey... I know!

109
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,208
This spot's becoming the
place where friendships begin!

110
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,666
It is, huh...?

111
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,500
This is where we came when
I first met you and Uiharu.

112
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,625
It's good?

113
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,041
You've got a little bit
on your face, though.

114
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,875
Still... it's too bad the
others couldn't come...

115
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,708
Why would Judgment and Antiskill
be holding a joint conference

116
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,833
about something
like earthquakes?

117
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,958
It'd make more sense
if it was a case.

118
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,833
Heh, heh... I didn't really
want to get into it earlier...

119
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:04,041
but there's a hot rumor
going around about that.

120
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,916
There is one thing
we know for certain

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,250
about the recent spate
of tremors in the city.

122
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,041
Despite what many
people think...

123
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,833
they are not earthquakes.

124
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,583
To be precise...

125
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,333
-Poltergeists?
-You're kidding me.

126
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,416
No...! I really
think this is true!

127
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,250
What are we talking
about here...?

128
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,125
Furniture moving around
on its own, and stuff?

129
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,833
No P--waves or S--waves
were observed...!

130
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,500
It's a paranormal phenomenon,

131
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm telling you...! Paranormal!

132
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,791
No doubt the rumor mill
is already churning

133
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,333
with all sorts
of absurd ideas,

134
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,625
so let me make this
perfectly clear.

135
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,125
This is not a
paranormal phenomenon.

136
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,625
The cause of poltergeisting

137
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,166
is simultaneous, multiple
incidents of RSPK Syndrome.

138
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,791
What does she mean?
What is RSPK Syndrom?

139
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,208
We're about to find out.

140
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,166
At this point, I am going
to turn the floor over to

141
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,666
Miss Terrestina of the
Multi-Active Rescue Team.

142
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,916
Who'll explain further.

143
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,625
Hello! As Miss Yomikawa
has informed you.

144
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,208
My name is Terrestina

145
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,708
and I am with the
Multi-Active Rescue Team

146
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,000
RSPK Syndrome refers to the
state or phenomenon that occurs

147
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,416
when an esper temporarily
loses their autonomy,

148
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,458
and causing their abilities

149
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,791
to unconsciously
run out of control.

150
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,250
The phenomenon varies
according to the esper.

151
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,416
Please look at the
display if you will.

152
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,000
When these phenomena
occur simultaneously,

153
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,333
the runaway abilities can
merge with each other,

154
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,458
and manifest as a uniform
poltergeist phenomenon.

155
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,250
As the poltergeisting
gains in strength

156
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,375
and spreads over a wide area,

157
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,875
the resulting occurrence can be
virtually indistinguishable

158
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,583
from the effects
of an earthquake.

159
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,333
The recent tremors
we've experienced

160
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,583
are the result of
this poltergeisting.

161
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,916
We're still investigating

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,583
the cause of the multiple
RSPK Syndrome incidents

163
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,000
that are responsible.

164
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,208
Unfortunately, there are
sure to be a few students

165
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,625
who will believe this is
some sort of occult power.

166
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,750
It's a pulse from an
alternate dimension!

167
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,291
Or another planet...!

168
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,958
Oh! Or maybe the result of
secret underground experiments

169
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,666
conducted by the government!

170
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,125
In any case...

171
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,541
Belief in such nonsense
could lead to mass hysteria...

172
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,583
which would only increase
the number of casualties.

173
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,791
That is why we
have asked Judgment

174
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,250
to attend this conference...

175
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,125
We want you to take
measures to ensure

176
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,875
that students are not
spreading inflammatory rumors.

177
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,541
Try to put a stop to
them before they start.

178
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,875
They say we can expect
a really big one

179
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,416
to happen before
much longer.

180
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,333
You see?

181
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,125
Oh, yeah, you're from District
Nineteen, right, Haru'ue?

182
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,458
Weren't there several
poltergeisting outbreaks

183
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,708
in that area?

184
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,125
What was it like?

185
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,500
Hey, you shouldn't be
getting so excited

186
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,041
about this kind of thing.

187
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,625
It could be
really serious.

188
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,333
Well, that was over a lot
sooner than I expected.

189
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,500
It says that Antiskill
has an additional meeting

190
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,750
after the joint one.

191
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,375
You look like you have
something on your mind, Konori.

192
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,291
Those RSPK Syndrome incidents
she was describing...

193
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,750
I've never heard of them...

194
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,958
And the way they're
handling this...

195
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,375
something about it just
doesn't sit right with me.

196
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,833
Why? They have specialists
investigating the occurrences.

197
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,458
That's their job,
after all...

198
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,750
At any rate, it's not
gonna do any good for us

199
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,250
to try and figure
it all out.

200
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,791
You're probably right,
but even so...

201
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,500
Hey...! We're done here!

202
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,625
Where are you guys now?

203
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,250
All right, Haru'ue.

204
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,416
What game would you like
to try out next...?

205
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,041
Oh...! I know, over here!

206
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,000
Uiharu sure is in
rare form, huh?

207
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:21,791
It looks like you are,
too, Sissy

208
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,541
Oh, no... No, these are...

209
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,083
You know, something about those
coins looks familiar to me...

210
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,708
Oh... You're playing
whack--a--mole?

211
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,625
Yeah... Well, sort of anyway.

212
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,291
I played that when
I was younger.

213
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,541
It's so fun.

214
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,958
I've never seen
anything like it before.

215
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,791
Look at them popping
up like that.

216
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,958
So cute!

217
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,125
Yes... very cute...

218
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,500
But, you know...

219
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,791
You might try hitting them,
instead of just staring.

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,250
Hit the moles?

221
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,083
But that's cruel.

222
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,458
Oh... I guess you're right.

223
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,791
Uh... okay...!

224
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,958
You can play the game
any way you want to.

225
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,291
One more time.

226
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,208
Um... that'll be the
fourth time in a row...

227
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,625
Hey... you guys,
why don't we check that out?

228
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,208
What is it?

229
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,333
Say "cheese!"

230
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,458
Cheese!

231
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,875
Let's see...

232
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,083
Sending...

233
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,708
There we go!

234
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,916
Here.

235
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,833
How should I put this?

236
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,541
The girl is a curiosity.

237
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,666
Really...?
She seems sweet.

238
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,416
Actually, she reminds me
of how Uiharu used to be.

239
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,958
What do you mean?

240
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,708
You know... back when
she'd first transferred in.

241
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:47,750
Where are you going?

242
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,833
Look out!

243
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,250
Oh, dear...
You ran right into it.

244
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,416
You okay?

245
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,125
Up there.

246
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,750
That poster?

247
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,791
The one for the
fireworks show?

248
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,500
Oh... yeah, that's supposed
to be tonight, isn't it?

249
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,541
Yeah, it is.

250
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,583
Hey, we should
all go together.

251
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,916
That's a great idea!

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We can dress up
and everything!

253
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,416
Well, what do you say?

254
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,000
-This is gonna be great!
-That sounds awesome!

255
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,416
Yeah!

256
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,166
I never worn one of these.

257
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,000
It feels strange.

258
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,500
Me too, I know
what you mean.

259
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,458
Isn't it a little long?

260
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,708
I'm looking up
how to wear them.

261
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,041
Oh, here, I think
I found something!

262
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,083
Use the sash to
adjust the length...

263
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,083
Sounds easy enough.

264
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,541
It looks pretty complicated.

265
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,250
Well... we can
give it a try!

266
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,166
Let's see here...

267
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,125
First, we pair up
the front, like so...

268
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,625
Ah... What a beautiful pendant!

269
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,916
It's special...

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,333
It's kind of a
good luck charm.

271
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,666
A good luck charm, huh?

272
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,291
How nice.

273
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,083
Now... let's see if we
can get this to fit right.

274
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,041
Okay... so what's the
next step in the process?

275
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,208
"After you pair
up the front,

276
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,666
you should raise
the garment's collar

277
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,666
approximately twenty
centimeters..."

278
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,375
I wanted to thank you.

279
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,416
Huh?

280
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,708
I mean it...

281
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,291
You've helped
me so much...

282
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,041
I can tell that
you're a good person.

283
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,333
Oh... it's nothing...

284
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,208
As a Judgment officer,
I'm happy to help you...

285
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,958
Really, I'm having a
lot more fun with this

286
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,666
than with my other
duties lately...

287
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,000
Sweeping up, looking for
stuff people have lost...

288
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,625
Oh, I see.

289
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,750
Anyway... I'm happy
to do anything I can

290
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,500
to help you feel at home...

291
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,583
So... you can
always count on me!

292
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,750
Oh... I'm starting
to understand

293
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,916
why you needed me to
come over so urgently.

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,916
Don't just stand there...!

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,458
Help us out of this thing!

296
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,041
There!

297
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,666
That should do it.

298
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,958
It's perfect.
Thank you.

299
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,208
That was amazing, Saten...

300
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,375
You made it look perfect
in no time at all!

301
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,541
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

302
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,000
We're gonna be late.
Let's hurry up.

303
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,916
I made a mess of things.

304
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,083
If I'd known how good
you were at this,

305
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,208
I would've asked
before we started.

306
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,250
Come on now,
you're doing just fine.

307
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,333
Well, I figure it should be
my turn to help out this time.

308
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,708
How so?

309
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,708
Do you remember how
difficult it was for me

310
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,041
to pass all those
Judgment tests...

311
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,958
and how that, in turn,
made me insecure

312
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,833
about other stuff, too?

313
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,125
Yeah, I do...

314
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,166
You were in quite
a state, huh?

315
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,000
Constantly getting
down on yourself.

316
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,416
But fortunately, I didn't
have to do it all alone.

317
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,375
You kept encouraging me.

318
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,750
You and the others were there
for me when I needed help.

319
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,041
Oh, yeah...?
And we were helpful?

320
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes.

321
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,208
It was all thanks
to you guys.

322
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,583
I finally passed
the tests...!

323
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,916
And that's why...

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,250
I think it's my turn now...
to help Haru'ue

325
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,083
the same way that
you guys helped me.

326
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,541
Oh... I mean...

327
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:54,750
it's not that I'm the only
one you should turn to...

328
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,333
I'm really glad that I have
you for a roommate, Uiharu.

329
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,166
I trust you!

330
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,833
Oh... good!

331
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,333
Look at you...!

332
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,625
Being recognized for your
good deeds at last...

333
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,666
I am so proud!

334
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,375
Geez! You make it sound

335
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,208
as though I'm a little
kid or something.

336
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,333
-My kid sister!
-I'm older than you!

337
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,500
Now, stop fidgeting.

338
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,125
We need to get you
dressed, don't we?

339
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,000
Ready? Let's go.

340
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,291
Whew!

341
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,625
Surely we're safe after
that, don't you think?

342
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,708
Escape successful!

343
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,208
We're on our way!

344
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,125
Could our dorm be
any more of a drag?

345
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,375
They won't even change our
curfew for a fireworks show?

346
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,916
Quit fidgeting. Your outfit will
be down around your ankles

347
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,958
if you continue.

348
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,208
Yeah, okay.

349
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,583
Although... I guess it
doesn't really matter,

350
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,666
since you're still wearing
those stupid shorts under it.

351
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,791
What's the big deal...?

352
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,416
Nobody is gonna see them.

353
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,416
I don't have to see them, but
that doesn't change the fact

354
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,791
that I know you
have them on.

355
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,833
Anyway... Is Konori
coming with us tonight?

356
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,833
Well, she said she wanted
to start investigating

357
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,666
these poltergeisting
incidents...

358
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,041
Something's been
nagging at her

359
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,750
ever since the conference
this afternoon.

360
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,208
Hmm... You have to admit,
it is weird...

361
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,500
All these events occurring,

362
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,375
almost as if they've
been coordinated.

363
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,333
Man, this is
taking me forever.

364
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,625
I don't know if the net's

365
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,916
ever seemed more full
of useless information.

366
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,916
Wow! Misaka,
you look fantastic!

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,125
You, too, Shirai.

368
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,625
You're both adorable!

369
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,333
Would you expect any less?

370
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,250
And you guys look
wonderful, as well.

371
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,125
Uh... thank you...
We did try.

372
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,166
Ah! All those stands!

373
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,208
You're right!

374
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,833
There sure are a lot.

375
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,000
Mmm, it smells so good!

376
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,166
-I'm going!
-Me too!

377
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,125
Sissy, be careful
running down that hill!

378
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,666
What do you think...?

379
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,583
Should we go?

380
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes, please!

381
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,583
Come on, Sissy.
You look ridiculous.

382
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,458
Hey,... What's the big deal?

383
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,708
It's a festival, right...?

384
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,041
I'm just getting
into the spirit.

385
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,875
Honestly!

386
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,500
Huh? What are
those trucks for?

387
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,958
MAR-They're with the
Multi Active Rescue Team.

388
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,166
They must be a
countermeasure

389
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,625
for all the poltergeisting.

390
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,875
Poltergeisting?!

391
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,541
Then... all the
rumors are true?

392
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,833
It would be a real mess

393
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,416
if one of those
incidents happened here

394
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,250
with all these
people around.

395
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,625
It's not that I don't
get why they're here...

396
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,041
but it's a shame on a
night like tonight...

397
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,458
They don't exactly
blend in at a festival.

398
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,958
Oh...! Just a second.

399
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,041
I know the perfect
place to go!

400
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,041
Nice, huh...?
We've got a great view here.

401
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,083
Hey, look, you guys!

402
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,625
There's another
round going.

403
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,416
You can kind of feel the
"boom" in your tummy,

404
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
can't you?

405
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,791
Yeah...

406
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,375
Like... like an echo.

407
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,083
It's so pretty.

408
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,208
Maybe I should have
gone to the festival.

409
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,208
It still feels like
something's wrong.

410
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,000
But I'm not making
any headway.

411
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,125
What's this?

412
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,041
AIM diffusion fields?

413
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,958
What a great show!

414
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,958
Woo--hoo!

415
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,250
Here they come!

416
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:07,833
-Light up the sky!!
-Light up the sky!!

417
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,000
Is something the matter?

418
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,000
I was just remembering.

419
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,208
Remembering what?

420
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,083
More like "who."

421
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,375
You see...
I had a friend once...

422
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,208
We were super close, just
like the two of you are.

423
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,791
Are you okay?

424
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,208
Something wrong?

425
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,625
Where's she going?

426
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,625
Haru'ue!

427
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,875
Hold on a sec!

428
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,958
Huh? I wonder
where they're going.

429
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,375
Finally! They're
taking the hint

430
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,291
and giving us time
alone together!

431
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,125
Now we can imitate
the fireworks

432
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,333
and let our bodies glow
with passionate fire!

433
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,750
Let go...! I don't
feel like fighting you.

434
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,500
It's too hot out here!

435
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,333
As hot as the flame that
burns in my heart for you!

436
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,125
Huh...? Who could it be?

437
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,666
Hi, Konori. What are you doing,
calling me at this hour?

438
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,833
Listen! It's about the
poltergeist incidents!

439
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,708
I know that doing
research is important,

440
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,416
but would it hurt you to take a
breather once in a while...?

441
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,166
The fireworks
show is beautiful.

442
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,958
Just listen to me,
will you?!

443
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,083
I've found a possible cause

444
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,583
for the RSPK Syndrome activity.

445
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,916
Intentional outside
interference

446
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,333
with AIM diffusion fields.

447
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,791
AIM diffusion fields.

448
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,208
So, what are you saying?

449
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,958
That all of this
poltergeisting lately

450
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,333
isn't just some
random accident!

451
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,041
Where are you...?

452
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,541
Where have you gone?

453
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,375
Haru'ue.... what's wrong?

454
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,125
Where are you?

455
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,750
You're saying there's
actually somebody

456
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,166
orchestrating
these events?

457
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,458
What was that...?

458
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,750
Shirai, hello?

459
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,750
Is this...?!

460
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,500
I think so.

461
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,083
It's poltergeisting!

462
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,875
I've got you!

463
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,666
What about the
other three?

464
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,875
Uiharu!

465
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,416
Uiharu!

466
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,291
Saten, are you all right?

467
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,083
That was a close call.

468
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,583
Are you injured...?

469
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,541
You're safe now.

470
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,083
I know that lady!

471
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,625
Haru'ue...!
Can you hear me?

472
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,916
Good, you're awake...

473
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,583
Are you okay?

474
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,125
That was quite a fall.

475
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,083
Where...?

476
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,458
Where are you...?

477
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,666
Please, where?

478
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,458
I don't understand.

479
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,416
Wow, that's amazing!

480
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,083
Something's collapsed.

481
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,750
Was there an accident?

482
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:37,208
[Music]

483
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,708
Where are you?

484
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:03,916
Where did you go?

485
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,416
This direction, Haru'ue...

486
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,083
No! No...! Not that way...!
Over here!

487
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,791
It's the blind
leading the blind.
