1
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,500
Who's back there?

2
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,666
I am Mitsuko Kongo of
Tokiwadai Middle School.

3
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,541
Knowing that, will you
still dare to attack me?

4
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:54,958
[Music]

5
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,583
I'm so excited!

6
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,375
We're going to the
Garden of Learning!

7
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,458
I don't know why they
gave it such a fancy name.

8
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,833
It's just the
area of town

9
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,833
where there's a cluster of
girls' schools, you know?

10
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,458
But they aren't just
any ordinary schools.

11
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,166
The ones in the Garden
of Learning are special.

12
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,250
They're all well--known
girls' schools.

13
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,750
Tokiwadai Middle School
is only one of them.

14
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,041
Yeah, sure, whatever.

15
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,625
We're only allowed
in here today

16
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,291
because Shirai was kind
enough to invite us.

17
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,625
If she hadn't, a student
as lowly and common as I am

18
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:43,958
would have no
business visiting

19
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,875
such an exalted place as this.

20
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,958
Could you please
stop groveling?

21
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,041
You're starting to sound
like a brown--noser.

22
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,583
Oh, hey. What is this?

23
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,166
Oh, I see now.

24
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,125
You've got a page
highlighted in here.

25
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,291
Is this a bakery
you want to try out

26
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,708
while we're visiting, Saten?

27
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,250
Well, of course! It's
the Pasticceria Manicagni!

28
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,791
Just read what it says.

29
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,125
"The cheesecake
is a work of art,

30
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,250
made from an authentic
Italian recipe

31
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,708
and using only the
finest ingredients."

32
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,291
I've always wanted
to try a piece,

33
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,958
but the Garden of Learning
is the only place

34
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,958
in the whole country
where they have it!

35
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,666
You're more of a
sucker for advertising

36
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,583
than I thought, Saten.

37
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,833
Next stop, the entrance
to the Garden of Learning.

38
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,583
Repeat. Entrance to
the Garden of Learning.

39
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,958
Uh--oh.

40
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,458
The bus got us here
ahead of schedule, huh?

41
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,916
It shouldn't be a problem.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,041
Three, two and one.

43
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,166
Wow! I've never seen weather
forecasts as accurate

44
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,166
as the ones they
have in this city.

45
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,208
The word "forecast"
is so vague.

46
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,041
It's more accurate to say
that they are readings

47
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,708
of future events established
by precise calculations.

48
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,333
It kinda gets
boring, though.

49
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,916
It would be more exciting
if they would slip up

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,500
every once in a while.

51
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,416
Enough of that.
Let's get moving!

52
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,333
We have invitations
from Kuroko Shirai,

53
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,041
first--year at
Tokiwadai Middle School.

54
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,750
I'm Kazari Uiharu.

55
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,916
And I'm Ruiko Saten.

56
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,125
Very good. Go on ahead.

57
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,500
This is such a charming
area, isn't it?

58
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,708
Everything looks different
from the rest of the world,

59
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,041
down to the crosswalks
and traffic signals.

60
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,500
Pretty impressive, huh?

61
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,791
It really does feel like

62
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,416
we're tourists visiting a
foreign country!

63
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,791
Yeah, it does.

64
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,833
You know, it kinda seems

65
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,166
like we're attracting
a lot of attention.

66
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,791
Huh?

67
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,041
Yeah, you're right.

68
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,666
I bet it's our outfits.

69
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,166
I'm sure it's unusual
for them to see students

70
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,958
who aren't from this area.

71
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,125
Yeah. That makes sense.

72
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,958
Whoops! Look at the time!

73
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,791
Huh? Oh yeah, you're right.

74
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,458
Come on. We should hurry.

75
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,875
It looks like they're
running late, huh?

76
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,833
This is where we're
supposed to meet them, right?

77
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,166
Yeah, it is.

78
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,833
They said that they wanted
to see our school,

79
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,125
so it made sense for them to
meet us by the entrance.

80
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,916
How inconsiderate of them,

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,750
keeping my Sissy
waiting like this.

82
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,708
Oh, here they come now.

83
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,541
What happened to you?

84
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,708
Well, you see ...

85
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,791
I sort of slipped
in a puddle.

86
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,166
Ah ...

87
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,166
You asked for a quick
change of clothes.

88
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm afraid this school
uniform's the only thing

89
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,625
I have to offer.

90
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,541
No, this'll be fine.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,333
Does the size
work for you?

92
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,583
Oh, yeah, it
fits perfectly.

93
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,875
Though the skirt's
a bit short,

94
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,750
so it's a little breezy.

95
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,791
It's not fair you
get to wear that.

96
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,791
-Huh?
-I know!

97
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,916
We should trade outfits!
What do you say?

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,750
I think it's a great idea!

99
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,583
Yours is too small
for me to wear.

100
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,333
Then, I'll go find
a puddle to slip in.

101
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,916
Let it go already.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,250
It will only be
for a little while!

103
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,625
Give it up, Uiharu!

104
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,416
Aw, pleeease?

105
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,916
I sent your dirty uniform
off to the cleaners.

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,708
Stop by there on
your way home.

107
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,041
And if that doesn't work,

108
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,041
we can always have it sent
to your dorm for you.

109
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,250
-It's no trouble.
-Wow.

110
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,916
That's what I
call service.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,041
Do you have maids at your
school, too? I bet you do!

112
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,625
I bet they come every day!

113
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,125
Oh, calm down.

114
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,750
Hmm ... Maybe I want that
strawberry crostata.

115
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,375
It looks good.

116
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,416
No, wait ... That Monte
Bianco over there

117
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,416
looks awfully delicious, too.

118
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Ah! But how could I pass
up that cioccolata?

119
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,375
Is it really that difficult
of a decision to make?

120
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,750
Oh, not for me.

121
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,833
I've already decided on
the cheesecake for sure.

122
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,791
Uiharu the sun'll be
going down soon.

123
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,166
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,291
Just one more
minute, okay?

125
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,000
Hold on.

126
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,125
Yes?

127
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,458
Huh?

128
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,083
Uh,

129
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,500
okay. Yes, I understand.

130
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,416
-Is Judgment calling us in?
-They sure are.

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,833
Go figure.

132
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,166
Their timing couldn't be
any worse if they tried, huh?

133
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,458
We'll get yours wrapped
up for take--out, Uiharu.

134
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,041
Thanks. I appreciate it.

135
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,041
-We should probably hurry.
-Yeah!

136
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,041
Always on the move, huh?

137
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,083
Well, I guess
it's just us.

138
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,083
Uh, just a sec.

139
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,166
I need to use the
ladies' room real quick.

140
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,791
Honestly! Why are they
calling us in on our day off?

141
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,375
It's a Saturday!

142
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,208
-Hey!
-Ow!

143
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,625
No complaining. You can do
that on your own time.

144
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,791
Yes, of course.

145
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,375
Sorry, Konori.

146
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,083
So, are you going to tell
us why you've called us in?

147
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,583
It began yesterday and
continued overnight.

148
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,583
Six students, all
from Tokiwadai.

149
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,666
They've been assaulted in a
string of related attacks.

150
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,500
What's more, it's
all been happening

151
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,125
in the Garden of Learning.

152
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,166
There's no one lower
than a Level 3 Esper

153
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,000
enrolled in Tokiwadai
Middle School.

154
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,375
But these students
are being targeted

155
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,916
and easily bested, which
leads me to believe ... ...

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,375
that the perpetrator must
be a formidable Esper.

157
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,291
That is likely the case.

158
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,708
However, we don't
know their ability.

159
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,083
Every victim ... ...

160
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,125
was knocked unconscious
using a stun gun.

161
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,875
And then?

162
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,291
What happened to the victims
once they were knocked out?

163
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,958
I can show you
the photographs.

164
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,791
It's not pretty.

165
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,500
I suggest you prepare yourselves
before looking at them.

166
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,500
The tea is starting
to get cold.

167
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,000
I've prepared for
this sort of thing

168
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,666
since I first applied to
be a Judgment officer.

169
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,083
The same goes for me.

170
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,208
Right.

171
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,083
In that case ...

172
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,416
Hey, what's
taking so long?

173
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,500
What happened?

174
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,083
Saten, wake up!

175
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,875
Targeting our school?

176
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,166
Oh yeah.

177
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,125
She was wearing
our uniform.

178
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,125
How's she doing?
Is she all right?

179
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,500
Well, physically, it's
nothing too serious.

180
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,125
She should be fine after
she lies down for a bit.

181
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,375
It's just ...

182
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,333
Have you zeroed in
on any suspects yet?

183
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,250
No, not yet.

184
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,000
See, their particular ability
is making it tricky for us.

185
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,791
Tricky in what way?

186
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,833
The attacker
was invisible.

187
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,791
I'm telling
you, it's true!

188
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,833
I didn't see anything
when it happened!

189
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,250
Yes, but here. Take a look.

190
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,916
This is the image from
the surveillance camera.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,375
I don't care!

192
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,041
For the last time, I
didn't see a single thing!

193
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,250
So the victims didn't see
their attacker at all.

194
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,125
Naturally, our first idea
was that it was an Esper

195
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,791
who could perform
optical manipulation.

196
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,125
We made a list of
forty--seven Espers.

197
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,833
They all have the ability
to make themselves

198
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,625
disappear completely.

199
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,458
However, every last person
on the list has an alibi.

200
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,083
Well, whoever it was

201
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,500
showed up on the surveillance
cameras, didn't they?

202
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,250
Maybe it's something different
than optical manipulation.

203
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,041
That could be the case.

204
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,125
-Oh, a dove.
-Eh?

205
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,125
Shirai, didn't you
see it just now?

206
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,583
No, sorry. I didn't
notice anything.

207
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,916
You didn't
notice anything.

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,375
Uiharu, there's something
I'd like you to try.

209
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,166
Here it is.

210
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,083
The ability's name
is "Dummy Check."

211
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,500
It's the power to
impair the awareness

212
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,958
that a person is looking
at a particular subject.

213
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,958
Apparently, only
one person has it.

214
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,000
Miho Jufuku, a
second--year

215
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,666
at Sekichu Middle School.

216
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,125
That's our attacker!

217
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,833
I don't think that's
possible, though.

218
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,083
She's only a Level 2.

219
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,000
She's not strong enough.

220
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,416
According to her test
results, she doesn't have

221
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,708
the power to completely
conceal herself.

222
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,458
Man, I really thought we
were on the right track, too.

223
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,583
-What happened?
-She's awake!

224
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,375
You should take it easy.

225
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,750
W--w--w--w--wha--?

226
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,416
Come on now. Just get
a hold of yourself.

227
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,958
I understand. This
has to be a shock.

228
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,375
If your bangs were
a little longer,

229
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,666
like this girl's are,

230
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,791
you would at least
be able to hide it.

231
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,291
Who has long bangs?

232
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,750
Hey! It was her!

233
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,291
You mean you saw the
person who did this to you?

234
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,708
That's right.

235
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,458
When it happened ...

236
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:47,708
I saw this girl
in the mirror.

237
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,000
First surveillance
cameras, now mirrors.

238
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,166
So that's how it is, then.
I think I get it.

239
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,916
She can make people
unaware of her presence,

240
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,500
but only if they're
looking right at her

241
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,500
with the naked eye.

242
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,250
That girl made me
look like a freak,

243
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,583
and now she's gonna
pay for it, big time!

244
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,958
Let's do it, Uiharu!

245
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,875
Do what?

246
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,583
You've got some skills
with that thing.

247
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,833
Yeah, well, I have
to do it like this,

248
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,291
or else the terminals here

249
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,500
won't be able to keep up
with the processing.

250
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,166
Anyway, the Garden of
Learning doesn't fall

251
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,666
under the hundred and
seventy--seventh

252
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,583
Branch's jurisdiction, Kuroko.

253
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,375
Are you sure this is okay?

254
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,666
Our superiors have just
given us the go ahead.

255
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,000
Now you're talking!

256
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,083
Uiharu, let's get
this show on the road.

257
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,083
I'm on it. And, "Go."

258
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,041
There you have it, girls.

259
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,291
We are now connected to all
two--thousand fifty--eight

260
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,291
surveillance cameras in
the Garden of Learning.

261
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,625
I'll find you now, creepy
chick with the long bangs.

262
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,875
Just you wait.

263
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,833
You're gonna get what's
coming to you soon.

264
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,375
I still haven't forgotten that
cake you promised me earlier.

265
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,291
Do this and I'll get you
a dozen of them if you want.

266
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,750
Yeah!

267
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,208
That's going
to be too many.

268
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,625
-Oh, you think so?
-Huh?

269
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,291
Really? Cause I don't
see any harm in it.

270
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,208
We're not talking about
cake anymore, you two.

271
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,666
Huh?

272
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,041
Uiharu, go ahead and
exclude areas E through H,

273
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,833
as well as J and N.

274
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,875
Okay.

275
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,750
Those are the areas
the furthest distance

276
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,500
away from Tokiwadai.

277
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,375
Since they're so far,
students from our school

278
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,875
rarely have reason
to go there.

279
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,666
I think we can go ahead and
exclude high-traffic areas, too.

280
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,291
Why do you say that?

281
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,291
The suspect's uniform.

282
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,875
Don't you think it
would stand out a bit

283
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,833
in the Garden of Learning?

284
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,541
Yeah, it would.

285
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,416
Think she uses her ability
whenever people are around,

286
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,291
even when she's
not attacking?

287
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,041
Probably. Even so,

288
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,500
she can't possibly maintain
it 24 hours a day.

289
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,291
Then she'll have to find
someplace out of the way

290
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,541
so she'll be able
to catch her breath.

291
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,291
Exactly!

292
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,625
And if that is
the case, then ...

293
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,458
You should put that away.

294
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,166
You were the one who gave me
these ridiculous eyebrows.

295
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,750
I fully intend to pay
you back with interest.

296
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,541
She really disappeared.

297
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,250
This is no time
to be impressed.

298
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,000
Go after her, Saten!

299
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,375
All right, I'm on my way.

300
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,958
-Ow!
-What just happened?

301
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,916
Something bumped into me,
but I don't know what it was.

302
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,500
Coming through!

303
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,041
Be careful!

304
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,666
Here we go.

305
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,166
As you can see,
I'm with Judgment.

306
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,625
I'm taking you
into custody.

307
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,291
Come quietly, or ...

308
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,416
Yep. She was never
going to come quietly.

309
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,041
Uiharu, could I get
some directions, please?

310
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,541
Working on it.

311
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,125
Go out to the
street, turn left,

312
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,750
then go up to Third Avenue.

313
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,458
Copy that. Thanks a lot.

314
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,041
Sure.

315
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,458
How?

316
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,916
How?

317
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,333
How?

318
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,583
This game has been fun.

319
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,208
But it's all over now.

320
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,208
Impossible. Why isn't my Dummy
Check working anymore?

321
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,750
Who can say?

322
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,791
This is why I hate all
you brats from Tokiwadai!

323
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,125
Nice try.

324
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,541
But, you see, stun guns don't
really have any effect on me.

325
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,083
Uh, um ...

326
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,625
And that was actually
holding back.

327
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,208
Uiharu! Please contact
Antiskill and inform them

328
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,666
that we have successfully
apprehended the suspect.

329
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,250
Right.

330
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,916
Good work today!

331
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,625
One last thing to do.

332
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,666
So, what'll it be?

333
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,958
What kind of eyebrows
should I give her?

334
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,333
No!

335
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,625
Oh, dear.

336
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,375
Funny looking, right?

337
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,208
Oh, well, uh ...

338
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,041
Go ahead and laugh!

339
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,583
Laugh as loud as you can.

340
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,625
Just like he did!

341
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,291
Just like who?

342
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,166
It was spring.

343
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,041
I was dozing off in the
glorious midday sunshine.

344
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,083
In my naiveté, I believed
that this time of peace

345
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,625
and comfort would
last forever.

346
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,750
But then ...

347
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,500
Spring came to an end.

348
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,500
It was so sudden.

349
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,250
Tell me why!

350
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,666
Are girls from Tokiwadai
really so special?

351
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,125
That's not exactly
the reason.

352
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,583
Then what is it?

353
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,166
Well, your eyebrows
are just so ...

354
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,916
Weird!

355
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,166
I hated the boy
who cast me aside,

356
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,916
and I hated the dumb
girl from Tokiwadai

357
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,625
who took him away from me!

358
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,000
But more than
anything else

359
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,375
I hated the funny eyebrows
that ruined my life!

360
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,791
And that's why I decided
I would give everybody

361
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,625
funny eyebrows like mine!

362
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,583
-Uh, what?
-Yeah, sorry.

363
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,708
You lost me about
halfway through, there.

364
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,708
What's the matter?

365
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,916
Just go ahead. Laugh at me!
You know you want to!

366
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,500
Um ...

367
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,958
I, uh ...

368
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,291
I don't think
they're weird.

369
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,000
Not weird they're just ...

370
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,791
um ...

371
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,291
Yeah! They give your
face character,

372
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,541
that's what it is.

373
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,750
Personally, I
really like them!

374
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,625
Now that's taking
it too far.

375
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,166
I, uh ...

376
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,041
Is it okay if I sent
you a letter sometime?

377
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,500
That's fine.

378
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,666
Impressive.

379
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,041
She really could make
herself disappear completely.

380
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,583
Now that you mention it,

381
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,708
wasn't she listed
as a Level 2 Esper?

382
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,541
That is odd.

383
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,791
I wonder, could the
info in the database

384
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,541
be incorrect?

385
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,333
No, of course not!

386
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,958
What is going on here?

387
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,750
Oh? The other
victims too, huh?

388
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,416
Yes, I see.

389
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,625
Here's the thing.

390
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,333
It's a special ink
developed by a university

391
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,500
in the tenth
school district.

392
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,250
They say there's no way it's
coming off sooner than a week.

393
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,291
What now, Saten?

394
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,041
Do you want me to get that
cute hat ready for you again?

395
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,625
That jerk.

396
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,125
Stupid eyebrow girl!

397
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,166
I knew I should've
drawn something on her!

398
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,458
Calm down, Saten!
Get a hold of yourself!

399
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,416
What am I gonna do?

400
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,833
Hey, Uiharu. Have you
heard of the sandal hag?

401
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,041
"#4 Urban Legends"
The sandal hag?

402
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,916
They say she's this ugly
old woman in sandals

403
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,208
-who chases after you!
-Yikes!

404
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,416
-And she's butt naked!
-That's just gross!
