1
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,541
That was an odd noise.

2
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,333
What was that? A firecracker?

3
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,125
-It startled me.
-Yeah.

4
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,958
There was another
incident?

5
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,208
Yes, it was the
fifth one so far.

6
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,166
Luckily the explosion
was relatively small,

7
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,791
and no one was hurt.

8
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,375
Even so ...

9
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,375
Even so, if
it's just a prank,

10
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,500
it's not a very funny one.

11
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,375
So, have any leads so far?

12
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,916
Well, it's not much,
but we finally got

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,541
something to go on yesterday.

14
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:48,041
Tell me, Sissy, do you
know about gravitons at all?

15
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,708
Gravitons.

16
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,583
Um, those are gravity
particles, right?

17
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,875
Yes, that's right.

18
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,625
In each of the attacks,
the satellite detected

19
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,250
a sharp spike in gravitons

20
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,000
immediately before
the explosion occurred.

21
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,125
The speed of the
gravitons was accelerated

22
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,500
explosively using
an aluminum base,

23
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,750
so they popped out into
the surrounding area.

24
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,375
Thus, the aluminum was
transformed into a bomb

25
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,041
as far as we can tell.

26
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,583
Hm.

27
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,041
Why use aluminum, though?

28
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,958
-Who knows?
-Well, shouldn't you?

29
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,208
Anyway, at least
this indicates

30
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,416
it was the work of an
Esper, doesn't it?

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,250
Just search through
Academy City's databank,

32
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,875
and you should
have the guy.

33
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:28,208
The data bank registers all of
the students' ability info.

34
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,333
Of course. That was the
first place we turned to.

35
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,000
The corresponding ability
is called Synchrotron.

36
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,083
We found only one Esper
whose power could be used

37
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,916
to make aluminum explode.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,416
It was a Level 4 student.

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,583
That's simple. This person
must be the suspect.

40
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,833
Except the thing is,
she has an alibi.

41
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,166
It's solid, too.

42
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,750
The girl has been
in the hospital.

43
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,333
So, there's no way she
could have orchestrated

44
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,125
any of the attacks.

45
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,458
So, that's ruled out.

46
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,375
The inquiry's reached
a dead--end, then?

47
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,791
I'd say so.

48
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,291
I can't believe there
would be such an oversight

49
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,791
in the databank.

50
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,125
Oh. Well, maybe ...

51
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,041
Maybe there's an
unregistered Esper out there

52
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,375
or something.

53
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,000
Hm ...

54
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,708
So, I think I should join in on
the search for this criminal.

55
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,375
No, absolutely not.

56
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,958
I know how you think.

57
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,166
Let's see.

58
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,833
"This could be fun,
facing a new opponent.

59
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,583
Yes, I'd like the chance
to pit my powers against his.

60
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,958
That's exactly what you were
just thinking, wasn't it?

61
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,166
-Don't lie.
-No. I would never think that.

62
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't you know that
you can't fool me?

63
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,083
I can see right
through you.

64
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,583
Come on, now.

65
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,666
It's like I've told
you over and over.

66
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,708
Remember that you're
a civilian, Sissy,

67
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,416
and maintaining the peace
of the city---- "...

68
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,416
is a job for Judgment or
Antiskill, and nobody else."

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
I know.

70
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,208
You've told me
that enough.

71
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,583
If you think I
serve in Judgment

72
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,208
because I get a kick out
of this sort of thing,

73
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,583
you're sadly mistaken.

74
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,250
Now, look. That's not
what I was saying!

75
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,333
Listen to me.

76
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,250
I need you to make
some promises now.

77
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,791
First one, that you will
not go recklessly

78
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,625
poking your nose
into this case.

79
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,083
Is this really necessary?

80
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,083
I don't think
that you're----

81
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,916
And second, in the
unlikely event

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,166
that you do become involved,

83
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,791
you will not charge
into a fight,

84
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,833
but wait for Judgment
to arrive on the scene.

85
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,291
Hey, now. I always take care of
things before you guys show----

86
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,458
And third, you must not wear
shorts under your skirt.

87
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,291
What's that got to
do with anything?

88
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,250
It may not deal directly
with this issue,

89
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,250
but I wanted to use
this opportunity

90
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,000
to help you elevate
your sense of style.

91
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,583
You must remember, Sissy,

92
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,000
that as the Ace of Tokiwadai,

93
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,625
you have
an image to uphold.

94
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,208
You still seem to lack the
self awareness necessary

95
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,583
This is totally off--topic!

96
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,000
No. Please listen to me.

97
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,666
If you were more self--aware,

98
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,666
you would realize that the
Ace should not sleep

99
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,666
with a teddy bear nor bathe
with a strange frog doll.

100
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,250
It's about time for you to let
go of those childish things.

101
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,750
And there's more.

102
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,333
For instance, those cutesy
pajamas you insist on wearing.

103
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,250
I mean, you are the third
ranked Level 5 Esper

104
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,916
Who do you think you are?

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,666
Why should I ever
listen to you?

106
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,583
Oh. I see.

107
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,333
Well, what do you think?

108
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,291
Uh, well, maybe ...

109
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,333
Could you sit down,
if that's okay?

110
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,875
I think it'll help.

111
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,791
Here's my theory.

112
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,250
I think Shirai means well

113
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,791
and her concern is keeping
you safe and out of danger.

114
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,625
Out of danger?

115
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,791
Like with these graviton
attacks we've had.

116
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,375
Oh. Is that their
formal name now?

117
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,416
At first, they were just
put into empty tin cans

118
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,166
or garbage bins, but the
suspect has evolved.

119
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,500
The latest bombs were put
into stuffed animals

120
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,083
or other toys to make
them less suspicious.

121
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,041
Who would do that? It's awful.

122
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,791
You can see how
serious it is now

123
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,791
and why Shirai might be a bit
concerned about you helping.

124
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,916
Thank you for waiting.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,666
One fruit parfait,
as ordered.

126
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,708
Wow! Finally!

127
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,500
I am so hungry!

128
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,416
U--i--ha--ru!

129
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,083
Oh! Hello, Shirai.

130
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,750
Trying to duck your
responsibility

131
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,708
by lounging around here?

132
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,625
Well? Are you ready
to go on patrol?

133
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,250
Of course.

134
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,416
Oh! But, uh, my parfait.

135
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,875
Uh ... Aw, just a bite? Please?

136
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,416
I asked Uiharu to join
me here to have a snack.

137
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,875
Hm?

138
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,958
If that's a problem, then
you should talk to me.

139
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,500
It's nothing
to do with you.

140
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,833
This is exclusively
a Judgment matter.

141
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,000
So, we civilians should
butt out, is that it?

142
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,958
What more do you
want from me, Sissy?

143
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,375
Like I've already
explained,

144
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,708
whatever you want to imagine,

145
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,083
Judgment work isn't exactly
a walk in the park.

146
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,208
Wha-?

147
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,708
Ah, my parfait!
Please, just one bite!

148
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,541
She is so condescending!

149
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,375
All I hear is "Judgment
this" and "Judgment that."

150
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,125
I'd be more impressed by
them if they showed up

151
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,791
before I'd taken
care of everything.

152
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,708
Well, whatever.

153
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,166
I'll give it to her later.

154
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,416
What are you just
standing around for?

155
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,208
Uh, sorry.

156
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,416
You mean me?

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,041
Do I have it wrong?
Are you not my backup?

158
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,416
Your backup? What?

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,458
Oh! No.

160
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,291
You see, funny story, one
of my friends just left this

161
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,333
Stop blabbering
and put on your armband.

162
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,625
We need to go!
Come with me.

163
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,333
What? Where are we going?

164
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,916
To do our jobs, obviously.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,958
Oh. Have you not heard yet?

166
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,625
To do our jobs?
That means I----

167
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,708
Hey. You don't know what's
going on, do you?

168
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,125
Come to think of it, I
don't know your face.

169
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,291
Are you one of
the new recruits?

170
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,333
Hm ...

171
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,750
Yes! I'm Misaka,

172
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,500
and this is my
first day!

173
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,000
Misaka.

174
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,750
You know, I think I've
heard that somewhere before.

175
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,041
I'm sorry, but I
don't know your name.

176
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,708
I'm Mii Konori of
the 177th Branch.

177
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,083
Good afternoon, Konori.

178
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,500
Nice to meet you!

179
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,291
Oh. Yes. Same to you.

180
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,875
I'll show her that a
civilian is perfectly

181
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,833
capable of doing
Judgment work.

182
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,625
They can throw whatever
they want at me.

183
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,750
I'll take it!

184
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,625
Here.

185
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,583
What is that thing?

186
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,208
What is this? It's a broom,
obviously.

187
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,500
Oh.

188
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,916
We're here to tidy
this place up.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Uh, really?

190
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,583
It's just, well, you know.

191
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,291
I'm in Judgment and all.

192
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,250
Exactly. Students throw
their litter about,

193
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,833
and we in Judgment have
to pick up after them.

194
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,416
Didn't you learn that
in your training?

195
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,208
Eh-Oh!

196
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,833
Yes, I remember that now!

197
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,458
This is what
Judgment does?

198
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,125
You've got to
be kidding me.

199
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,708
Hey, you just threw
trash on the ground!

200
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,208
Oh. You can get this, too.

201
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,375
You little punk!
Come back here, right now!

202
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,291
Huh. You got
what you deserved.

203
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,083
Now throw

204
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,166
-Eh---- Huh? Uh ...

205
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,875
Seriously?

206
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,416
I can't believe anybody
would be careless enough

207
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,166
to leave their
armband here.

208
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,625
Well, what did they say?

209
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,333
No luck.

210
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,208
No one saw anything
matching its description,

211
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,833
and nothing's
been turned in.

212
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,375
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,166
What am I going
to do with you?

214
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,166
You'll have to submit
an official report.

215
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,125
But, for now, let's go
back to the branch office a-

216
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,250
What's the matter?

217
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,166
Are you lost, sweetie?

218
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,000
What were you thinking?

219
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,791
You can't get
trigger--happy with your powers.

220
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,291
Yeah, but ...

221
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,666
"But" nothing Misaka.

222
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,750
The use of your
ability is one thing.

223
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,583
Guarding the safety of
the city is another.

224
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,708
Uh ... Oh, yeah.

225
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,166
I think I remember now.

226
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,375
That was part
of my training.

227
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,875
Before you look
to your training,

228
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,375
look to your common sense.

229
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,416
The work of Judgment isn't
exactly a walk in the park!

230
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,708
Come on.

231
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,125
I'll do better!

232
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,291
I promise you I
can do this job!

233
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes, of course.

234
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,375
Just hang in there.

235
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,000
It's no use.
I should quit.

236
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,916
Oh, thank you.

237
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,541
Being out in the field is a
lot different than training,

238
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,541
isn't it?

239
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,250
Yeah. Totally.

240
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,750
I guess I never realized
how difficult it could be

241
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,541
to give directions
and help people.

242
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,583
Yeah. It was
hard for me, too.

243
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,166
You know, the maps.

244
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,791
It can be a hassle
even when you think

245
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,250
you know the place.

246
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,500
Yes. Konori here.

247
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,583
Right.

248
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,250
I hear you.

249
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,000
We'll both keep our
eyes open for it, then.

250
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,333
Well, it looks like we've
got something to find.

251
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,583
Oh yeah, really?

252
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,166
Yeah. They say it's a bag.

253
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,125
A bag?

254
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,250
In the beginning it
was just garbage bins,

255
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,208
but the latest bombs were
put into stuffed animals

256
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,125
or other toys to make
them less suspicious.

257
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,416
The bag we want, could it
be a kid's by any chance?

258
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,583
Well, yeah, but how
did you know that?

259
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,041
Apparently it's pink and
has some flowers on it.

260
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,833
She said she
left it on a bench,

261
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,208
and then a dog grabbed it
and started running away.

262
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,208
No! Not a dog!

263
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,166
We have to do
something now!

264
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,958
Come on. Let's hurry
up and go catch it.

265
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,208
Well, yeah.

266
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,125
It would be a pain if
he dropped it somewhere.

267
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,583
You're worried about that?

268
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,833
We would have no way of
telling who walked away with it,

269
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,625
so ... It
could be anywhere.

270
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,875
Let's go!

271
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,208
We need to find that bag!

272
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,708
Uh ... Uh--huh.

273
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,458
Of course.

274
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,541
Hey, sorry.

275
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,416
But I can't really
squeeze through there.

276
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,625
Don't worry about it.

277
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,666
I'm almost all the
way through. I think.

278
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,875
Are you okay, Misaka?

279
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,166
There's a bug.

280
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,958
It has lots of legs.

281
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,791
Ah! No! Get away!

282
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,750
Aw, come on.
Where are you hiding?

283
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,458
What is it?

284
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,375
There's a bug. It has no legs!

285
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,833
Ah! No! Get away!

286
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,625
Hm.

287
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,958
No, nothing here.

288
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,416
Why do I have to
be on the bottom?

289
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,083
And what is she doing?

290
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,083
The bag we're looking for
isn't gonna be up there.

291
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,708
This is stupid!

292
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,125
A little bit more to
the right, please.

293
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah. Sure.

294
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,208
Ah! There's a bug!

295
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,791
Ah! Whoa. Steady, now.

296
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, really? Area D, as well?

297
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,250
Okay, thank you.

298
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,750
We appreciate all your
help with this matter.

299
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,791
Oh, hey. Is Uiharu here?

300
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, she's in the back.

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,791
Yes. Judgment. Branch 177.

302
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,875
There you are!

303
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,166
You gotta listen to this.

304
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,416
I finally found the
song I was looking for.

305
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,125
Shh!

306
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,916
She's finally tired
enough to sleep.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,875
Aw, she's adorable!

308
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,708
I never knew you
had a little girl.

309
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah! No. Wait.

310
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,291
So, when will
she get flowers?

311
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,416
You know these don't grow
out of my head, right?

312
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,583
Oh, I see.

313
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,791
And for your information,

314
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,500
I don't have any
children, either.

315
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,833
But look at her.

316
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,416
Right around the eyes.
Do you see?

317
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,083
Not my daughter!

318
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,375
Easy, now.

319
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,958
You'll wake her up if
you're not careful.

320
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,541
You're the one
being loud, Saten.

321
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,750
Yeah, I'm sorry.

322
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,583
So, who is she?

323
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,875
Did she get lost
or something?

324
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,250
It's not that.

325
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,000
We're just trying to help
find her bag for her,

326
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,416
that's all.

327
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,791
Apparently it was a birthday
present from her parents,

328
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,791
so it's very important.

329
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,708
So we've asked the other
branches to assist us

330
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,041
in the search, also.

331
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,375
Until the search
is complete,

332
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,083
Shirai and I are
looking after her.

333
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,916
Wow. All of Judgment
looking for a bag?

334
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why is it such a big deal?

335
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,166
Life is much
different here.

336
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,375
You're completely separated
from your family.

337
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,041
It's something
everybody understands

338
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,500
when a child is homesick.

339
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,875
Hm. Judgment handles more than
I ever realized before now.

340
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,541
There, there.

341
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,500
It really matters.

342
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,083
I'm sick of this.
Where are you?

343
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey! Watch where
you're going, punk.

344
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,416
You bump into someone
without apologizing?

345
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,125
No. I didn't.

346
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,333
You ran----

347
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,500
Aw, look. The little
twerp wants to argue!

348
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,250
Stop it! What are you doing?

349
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,083
It's Judgment.
So no big deal, then.

350
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,791
What do you mean,
"No big deal then"?

351
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,666
You two were just
ganging up on that guy.

352
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,166
Shut up already.

353
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,458
What a brat.

354
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,125
No. Patience. Patience.

355
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,083
Are you okay?

356
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,125
It's a little
late for that.

357
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,666
That wasn't very polite.

358
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,125
Hey, Misaka.

359
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,000
Well? Did you find it?

360
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,541
Oh! No.

361
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,375
Not here either, huh?

362
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,458
Where haven't we looked
for it yet? Let's see.

363
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,041
Maybe here.

364
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,208
No. Please don't tell
me it's in the park.

365
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,791
There are all
these kids here.

366
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,541
True. Children and dogs
don't always get along.

367
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,125
Dogs? That's not what
I'm talking about!

368
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,291
Really?

369
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,041
Because it's a dog
we're looking for.

370
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,000
No, I ... I mean,
are you sure?

371
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,458
Let's concentrate
on the bag.

372
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,250
Why don't you start
over there, okay?

373
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,750
Hey! Don't leave me!

374
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,833
Off you go, now.

375
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,500
That's not fair.

376
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,916
Hey, lady, are you
a Judgment officer?

377
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,000
That's a
Tokiwadai uniform!

378
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,708
Are you a princess?

379
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,291
Uh, I ...

380
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,791
She's wearing shorts
underneath her skirt. Look!

381
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,208
Why do you think
she's wearing those?

382
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,500
Maybe it's a
princess thing.

383
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,583
Hey. Don't you have
underwear like normal people?

384
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,833
I'm wearing them
underneath the shorts!

385
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,541
She's going commando!

386
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,416
A commando
Judgment officer!

387
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,833
You don't know what
you're talking about!

388
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,333
Ooh, look. A dog!

389
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,000
Got you!

390
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,083
Konori, quick!
Stop right there!

391
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,541
I can take care of this.

392
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,083
He's fast! I don't
have any choice.

393
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,208
Hah--hah! I've got you!

394
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,875
Huh?

395
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,041
Look out!

396
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,250
No!

397
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,458
It's mine now!

398
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,083
Misaka!

399
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,833
Target safely recovered.

400
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,958
-She's so cool!
-Totally Tokiwadai!

401
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,083
-She is a princess!
-I knew it.

402
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,791
Well done, Misaka.
That was something.

403
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,333
Whoa! Uh, don't you think you
should handle it more gently?

404
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,291
And shouldn't we be calling
in the bomb squad now?

405
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,875
Uh,

406
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,541
what are you
talking about?

407
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,833
Here. Try not to
lose it again.

408
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,541
Yeah!

409
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,000
That was really good work.

410
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,291
I knew Konori
would come through!

411
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,125
I'm not the one who
found it, actually.

412
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,958
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, it's Misaka!

413
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,791
I'm sorry. I didn't realize

414
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,500
you were acquainted
with Misaka.

415
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,750
Um, acquainted with her?

416
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,416
That's Mikoto Misaka.

417
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,041
You know, from Tokiwadai?

418
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:34,375
Mikoto. Misaka.

419
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,000
You don't mean
the Railgun?

420
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,375
Well, yeah. But what
is she doing here?

421
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,791
And, more importantly,
what is she doing soaking wet?

422
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,625
Oh, about that.

423
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,416
She actually dove
into the fountain

424
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,250
to protect the
bag from going in.

425
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,541
Apparently
she was convinced

426
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,916
that there was a
bomb inside the bag.

427
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Hey, is that my ... ?

428
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,833
Seriously, how
does this happen

429
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,208
after all the lectures
I've given her?

430
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,041
Hey, now. This is totally
something she would do.

431
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,708
K--Kuroko!

432
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,125
I, uh, I can explain.

433
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,083
There's no need
to be flustered.

434
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,500
Miss Railgun of Tokiwadai.

435
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,583
Oh. Uh, well ...

436
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,541
She knows, then?

437
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,916
Okay, that's cool.

438
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,541
Come on. This way.

439
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,625
Pretty lady.

440
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,291
Thanks a lot!

441
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,625
Oh.

442
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,416
I mean, really I just ...

443
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,333
You're very welcome!

444
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,958
-Good job, sweetie.
-Mm--hm!

445
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,333
After everything
I said, Sissy,

446
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,916
Job well done.

447
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,166
This has been one heck
of a day, hasn't it?

448
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,375
You'll get no
sympathy from me.

449
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,416
You're the one who decided
to play Judgment officer

450
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,708
because you were
annoyed with the rules

451
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,416
I'd laid out for you.

452
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,708
I hope you learned your
lesson this time, at least.

453
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,625
It sure is hard, huh?

454
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,583
Being in Judgment, I mean.

455
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,083
What are you saying?

456
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,125
Maybe I should look at
you in a different light.

457
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,416
You don't know how
much I have longed

458
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,250
for this day to come.

459
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,041
Please look at me in
a different light!

460
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,250
If this one doesn't work,

461
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,333
I'm happy to change
it for you, Sissy!

462
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,500
Whoa! No! I didn't mean
that literally!

463
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,958
Sissy!

464
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,041
Sissy! Just look at me!
I'll change the light!

465
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,041
Anything you want!
Oh, Sissy!

466
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,125
Keep it down!

467
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,333
We're with Judgment!

468
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,541
I need everybody to
evacuate the store at once!

469
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,666
Hey, what's going on?

470
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,458
What's happening
in my store?

471
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,625
Sir, we have detected
accelerated gravitons here.

472
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,125
You what?

473
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,500
I'm sorry, but it's
possible there's a bomb

474
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,083
hidden somewhere
in this store.

475
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,583
Wha? A bomb?

476
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,000
Damn. Where is it?

477
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,791
Are you okay?

478
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,333
I'm sorry. I fell.

479
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,875
Let's get you out of here.

480
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,166
Thank you.

481
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,125
No! Not yet!

482
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,416
Are you okay?

483
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,541
Are you hurt?

484
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,083
I'm fine.

485
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,916
He shielded me.

486
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,375
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

487
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,875
I said I was gonna do
it, and I'm doing it now!

488
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,291
Doing what? Who are you?
