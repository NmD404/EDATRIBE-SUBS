1
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,875
From what we've learned today,
it should be apparent

2
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,500
that this aspect of
Academy City's

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,375
ability--developing curriculum
is the most important.

4
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,875
Personal Reality.

5
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,291
To put it another way,

6
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,500
it is the acquiring of
a reality unto oneself.

7
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,958
This is the basis for the
development of Esper powers.

8
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,875
Once you understand
Personal Reality,

9
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,875
you must begin to explore
quantum theory as well.

10
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,458
This concept is based on
the uncertainty principle

11
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,791
postulated by the German
physicist Heisenberg.

12
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,416
Now, Personal Reality
and quantum theory

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,833
are connected because they
have something in common.

14
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:08,250
Both concepts are
rooted in probability.

15
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,958
For example, let's look
at Schrodinger's cat.

16
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,541
Huh? A cold?

17
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,916
Yeah. I only have
a slight fever,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,458
but it won't seem to budge.

19
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,916
Okay.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Try to get some rest
and feel better.

21
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,083
Saten!

22
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,583
Ruiko Saten!

23
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,166
Uh, yes?

24
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,916
You look like you
already know the material.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,291
Maybe you'd like to explain
that last point to the class.

26
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,333
Oh, sure!

27
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,708
Let's see.

28
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,791
One sec.

29
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,791
Never mind.

30
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,750
I suggest you study up on
Personal Reality for next time.

31
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,166
That's all for today.

32
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,083
Who cares about theories
and thought experiments?

33
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,500
I wish they'd teach us
how to level up faster.

34
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,625
That would be useful.

35
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,375
It's really hot
out today, isn't it?

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,625
What's with the face?
You look super grouchy.

37
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,375
I can't believe that
Hatsuya Kaitabi was a Level 2.

38
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,708
It just doesn't make
any sense to me.

39
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,041
Kaitabi?

40
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,291
Oh.

41
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,333
The guy behind the
graviton attacks.

42
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,833
But, all of the destruction,

43
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,208
he would have to be at least
a Level 4 to cause that.

44
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,833
Right. And that can
only mean one thing.

45
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,166
Well, it has to mean ...

46
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,583
I have no idea.
What does it mean?

47
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,625
Hey, don't look at me.

48
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,666
That's kinda what
I was asking you.

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,625
You're stressing.

50
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,833
Let's take a break.

51
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,208
It might help
you to cool off.

52
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,375
What do you want?

53
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,083
Just whatever you're
having, Sissy.

54
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,333
You know what I've
always found strange?

55
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,125
How whenever you
hear a wind chime,

56
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,208
it makes you feel a
little bit cooler.

57
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,458
Yeah. It does that
because of synesthesia.

58
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,833
What's synesthesia?

59
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,458
Thank you for waiting.

60
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,291
Here you go.
Two strawberries.

61
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,083
It's the reception
of multiple sensations

62
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,708
from a single stimulus.

63
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,458
And we're paying
separately, by the way.

64
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,958
You were the one
who suggested it.

65
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,500
I thought it
was your treat.

66
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,625
Huh? What's that?

67
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, nothing at all.

68
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,958
So, anyway, seeing
reddish colors

69
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,416
makes you feel
warmer, right?

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,625
And in the same way,

71
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,041
seeing bluish tones
makes you feel cooler.

72
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,458
Reds are warm colors, whereas
blues are cool colors.

73
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,375
Right. And this shaved
ice is strawberry--red.

74
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,500
I get it.

75
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,000
The fact that it's
such a bright red

76
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,333
intensifies the fruitiness
of the sensation.

77
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:12,916
Did your brain freeze?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,375
Aw.

79
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,708
Misaka Shirai!
Hey you guys!

80
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,250
Hey, Saten.

81
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,208
Those ices look delicious.

82
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,375
Yeah, we feel your pain.

83
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,000
That happened to both
of us a second ago.

84
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,041
You know what's
going to happen,

85
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,083
but you can't
stop eating it.

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,958
Ooh. Did you guys
get strawberry?

87
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:35,916
Mm--hmm.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,416
Here, would you
like to taste?

89
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,125
Aw, that's so nice of you.

90
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,458
Don't mind if I do!

91
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,916
Mmm, yummy!

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,666
Let me give you a bite
of lemon in return.

93
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,875
Cool, thank you.

94
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,208
What? What do you
think you're doing?

95
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,583
Uh, tasting each
other's flavors.

96
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,333
You're tasting her flavor.

97
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,458
Tasting.

98
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,166
Flavor.

99
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,791
I could have done that!

100
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,875
Kuroko, you're a
complete idiot!

101
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, okay.

102
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,416
Then why don't
you kiss my ...

103
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,541
I mean taste
my flavor, too?

104
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,458
What would be the point?

105
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,125
You got the same
flavor I did.

106
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,625
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!

107
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,291
I am such a moron!

108
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,041
Hey, I just realized
Uiharu isn't with you today.

109
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,291
She stayed home
from school

110
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,541
because, apparently,
she's got a cold.

111
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,041
I was just on my way to drop
off some medicine for her.

112
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,708
-Is it really bad?
-No.

113
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,958
She doesn't think
it's anything serious,

114
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,291
but I know how
annoying colds can be.

115
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:39,500
You know, you guys
could come along, too.

116
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,583
Here we are!

117
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,375
We all wanted to
check up on you.

118
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,416
-Sorry if we're intruding.
-Hope it isn't a bad time.

119
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Thanks guys.

120
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,583
That's sweet.

121
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,791
Don't worry about it.

122
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, hold still.

123
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,000
It says 37 point three.

124
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,375
Well, that's
slightly high,

125
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,583
so you should
probably stay in bed

126
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,166
and be sure to cover up
so you don't catch a chill.

127
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,500
You know, Saten, it might
help prevent a chill

128
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,875
if you'd stop flipping
my skirt up all the time.

129
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,291
Don't give them
the wrong idea!

130
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,791
As Uiharu's best friend,

131
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,125
I just want to make sure she's
wearing panties every day

132
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,375
like she's supposed to.
It's my duty.

133
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,000
Of course I wear panties!
Every day!

134
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes, of course.
We know you do.

135
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,000
Now lie down before
you get any worse.

136
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,375
I'll go fix up a
cool towel for you.

137
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,625
Oh, I wanted to
ask you, Shirai,

138
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,083
have there been any developments
in the graviton attacker case?

139
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,958
There is one
thing, I guess.

140
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,666
It isn't really
much help, though.

141
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,208
We know that the person who's
responsible for the attacks

142
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,916
has a Level 2 ranking.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,625
But what he did was
unmistakably Level 4 stuff.

144
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,416
So the only development
so far is the discovery

145
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,916
that there's even more we
don't understand about it?

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,750
Yeah, that's
pretty much it.

147
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,041
Now that I think about it,

148
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,458
didn't you mention
something before

149
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,625
about a machine called
the Level Upper?

150
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,333
Huh?

151
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,166
It raises a person's
ability level?

152
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,166
Yeah, but like I said,
it's just a rumor

153
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,875
all totally unsubstantiated.

154
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,291
So there's no
proof it exists?

155
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,500
None at all.

156
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,541
The stories about
it are all mixed up.

157
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,500
It's nothing more than
an urban legend, really.

158
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,666
Oh, well.

159
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,125
I suppose there's no way

160
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,958
it could be that convenient,
is there?

161
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,708
The truth is, this isn't the
first time a person's Level

162
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,208
as shown in the
databank doesn't match

163
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,375
what they've
actually done.

164
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,333
We've seen situations
like this more than once

165
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,083
that girl with the funny
eyebrows and the stun gun

166
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,500
and the bank robber who
was a pyrokineticist.

167
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,000
I use those as examples

168
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,250
because they're ones you
already know about, Sissy.

169
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,375
But Judgment has recorded
even more instances

170
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,625
of an Esper's ability not
matching their attack.

171
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,291
Are you saying?

172
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,833
There really is such a thing
as a Level Upper somewhere?

173
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,750
Is there anything else
you can tell us about it?

174
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,083
Huh? Let me see.

175
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,583
There is something,
but it could be another rumor.

176
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,000
I heard somewhere about
people who use the Level Upper

177
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,125
posting to some kind of
message board on the net.

178
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,125
Do you know which
message board it is?

179
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,666
Um, let me think.

180
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,041
I don't know.
Let's see.

181
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,083
Take a look, Saten.

182
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,125
Could it be this one?

183
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,333
Ah, there it is!

184
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,583
Nicely done, Uiharu!

185
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,625
Now if we can only
determine their identities

186
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,083
and where they hang out.

187
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,791
I can't speak to
their identities,

188
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,500
but as for their
hangouts, look.

189
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,458
They seem to get together
at this restaurant

190
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,750
pretty frequently.

191
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,125
Thanks a lot, Uiharu.

192
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,583
I'm gonna look into it.

193
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,208
Oh, and get well soon!

194
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,875
Get back here!

195
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,625
This is a job for me!
Not you!

196
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,208
Sissy! Listen to me
when I'm talking to you!

197
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,416
Sissy!

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,541
Do you think they're
gonna be okay?

199
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,208
With those two, we don't
have anything to worry about.

200
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,458
I mean, Kuroko's a Level 4,
and Misaka is a Level 5.

201
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,000
What could they
need us for, right?

202
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,166
Yeah, I guess so.

203
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,000
Say, Uiharu,

204
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,916
what if we could get a
hold of the Level Upper?

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,041
Do you think we
could really use it

206
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,166
to increase our
ability levels?

207
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,375
Who knows?

208
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,291
But in any case,
cheating is wrong.

209
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,416
Yeah, I know.

210
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,750
Just hypothetically.

211
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,625
I would never actually
do it, of course.

212
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,291
Hey! I've got an idea!

213
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,958
The teacher called on
me at school today,

214
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,041
and I had no clue
how to answer.

215
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,916
Think you could
explain this to me?

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,291
I'm sick and you're asking me
to help you do your schoolwork?

217
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,500
I bet you're hungry.

218
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,333
I could make
something for you.

219
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,000
And now you're trying to bribe
me with the promise of food?

220
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,916
All right, then. Fine.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,041
I won't ask again.

222
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,083
Well, I guess I could eat.

223
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,333
So, anyway.

224
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,791
He told me to study up
on Personal Reality,

225
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,208
but I just don't get
the concept, you know?

226
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, it's complicated.

227
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,000
I feel like I've heard something
about it before, though.

228
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,875
You have to create a
reality unto yourself.

229
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,333
A reality unto oneself?

230
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,750
A reality unto you.

231
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,416
A reality unto me.

232
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,666
What are these
realities, anyway?

233
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,916
Delusions, maybe?

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,791
Oh. That might be it.

235
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,000
-Huh?
-Well, not delusions exactly.

236
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,791
Those are totally unreal.

237
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,333
But what about the assumptions
we make about the world.

238
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,958
The power of
our own belief?

239
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,375
The power of our
own belief, huh?

240
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,291
I'm only a Level 1, though.

241
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,125
I'm sure somebody else
could explain it better.

242
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,750
That was great.

243
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,375
I mean, when you first used the
phrase "reality unto oneself,"

244
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,333
I was confused.

245
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,291
But I feel like I'm
starting to understand.

246
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,958
Maybe I just have
to believe enough

247
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,041
and then my Level
will go up someday.

248
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,458
You'll be fine, Saten.

249
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,625
I know you.

250
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,500
You're too stubborn
to give up easily.

251
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,541
Sometimes you say
the rudest things.

252
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,666
You know that?

253
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,375
This is it.

254
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,500
Well, shall we go in?

255
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,166
Sissy, this doesn't
concern you.

256
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,666
Maybe but the people
we're looking for

257
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,125
might recognize you as
a member of Judgment.

258
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,250
-But, I...
-Look, it'll be fine.

259
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,875
Just let me handle it, okay?

260
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,916
You lay low at another
table and wait for me.

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,416
What's she planning to do?

262
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,916
I've got a bad feeling
about this idea.

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,083
-Okay, here I go!
-No, hold on!

264
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,916
Please don't go
in there, Sissy!

265
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,750
You came here looking
for information

266
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,000
on the Level Upper, huh?

267
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,708
I came across
your message board

268
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,208
and I thought it was
super interesting,

269
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,708
so I came here
to ask about it

270
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,833
because I know this is
where you guys hang out.

271
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,750
Please! I'm begging you!

272
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,041
So, will you tell me?

273
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,708
Don't know what
you're talkin' about.

274
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,250
Now scram already.

275
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,208
Come on, I'm not
asking very much.

276
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,500
You're buggin' us.

277
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,708
Shouldn't a squirt like
you be in bed by now?

278
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,291
This isn't working.

279
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,416
I knew from the beginning
it was going to fail.

280
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,250
Hey, now. I'm not
as young as I look!

281
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,666
You don't look like
such a little girl

282
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,041
from where I'm sitting.

283
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,750
As a matter of fact,
you're just my type.

284
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,916
Aw! You really mean it?

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,625
So about the Level Upper.

286
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,166
Don't get ahead of
yourself, sweetie.

287
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,500
That kinda information
doesn't come cheap, you know.

288
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,041
Oh. Well, I guess I have a
little money I can give you.

289
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,416
Yeah, money is
great and all,

290
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,666
but I actually had another
form of payment in mind,

291
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,875
if you get what I'm saying.

292
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,750
Hey now, don't get
the wrong impression.

293
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,125
I'm not that kind of girl.

294
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,958
I mean, I only just met
you tonight after all.

295
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,333
Are you sure
money won't do?

296
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,500
What was that earlier about
not being a little girl?

297
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,541
I'm... I'm in a really
rough spot right now.

298
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,458
What's going on with
all the sniffling?

299
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,916
I don't know what to do.

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,375
I don't have
anywhere else to turn

301
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,541
other than the Level Upper.

302
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,875
So, please.

303
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,625
Won't you help me?

304
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,083
Whatever,
just quit crying.

305
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,625
I'm just, I'm just so ...

306
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,166
That uniform.

307
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,541
Isn't it from Tokiwadai?

308
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,083
Yeah, now that
you mention it.

309
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,375
If we play it right

310
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,541
she could make for a
seriously good money tree.

311
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,583
Hey, uh ...

312
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,875
All right, kid.

313
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,500
Quit crying.
It's irritating me.

314
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,500
We'll give you
the information.

315
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,125
Really? Thanks so much!

316
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,708
We should step outside.

317
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,708
We're not gonna say
anything about it in here.

318
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,958
Let's go.

319
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,625
Okay, then.

320
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,291
This is far enough.

321
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,333
Nobody's going to
interfere with us out here.

322
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,583
Great!

323
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,708
Why don't you start by
giving us all the cash

324
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,208
you've got on you?

325
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,166
Oh, and you can hand
over your debit card

326
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,000
and PIN number, too.

327
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,000
And any credit
cards, of course.

328
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,916
Being a Tokiwadai lady,
I'm sure you've got a few.

329
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,958
Um, well, I did withdraw
some cash before I came here,

330
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,458
but I can't just
give it all to you.

331
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,541
Oh?

332
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,500
You wanna hear what
we have to say?

333
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,458
Then you'd better
hurry and pay up.

334
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,875
Do it now.

335
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,708
Give us every last
dime you've got

336
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,875
unless you want us
to strip search you

337
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,833
and get your
money that way.

338
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,208
How annoying.

339
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,000
Look, just hand over
the money or we'll...

340
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,750
Whoa! Are you okay?

341
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,625
You! You little brat!

342
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,500
I've had enough of this.

343
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,500
I was trying to go about this
in a more civilized manner,

344
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,541
but you guys had to
go and get nasty.

345
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,666
Now tell me everything you
know about the Level Upper.

346
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,666
I'd change my tone
if I were you,

347
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,000
though we're
happy to show you

348
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,791
just what our powered--up
strength can do.

349
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,416
More of them.

350
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,750
Have all these guys really
used this Level Upper thing?

351
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,125
With this many of them at
the same Level as Kaitabi...

352
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,750
Yeah, I'm gonna
give it to you now.

353
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,041
Take my Level 2...

354
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,500
There were a lot of
you guys to deal with.

355
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,958
I'm afraid things were
bound to get a little messy.

356
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,833
You really did a number
on them, didn't you?

357
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,500
It ... it's the boss!

358
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,583
Hey, what's going on?

359
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,041
What were you trying to do to
that little lady over there?

360
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,000
We're sorry, Boss.

361
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,625
Shamelessly trying to
steal a young girl's money?

362
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,416
But, Boss...

363
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,708
Are you talking back to me?
To me?

364
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,916
I... I'm sorry!

365
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,291
I'm not the one you
need to apologize to.

366
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,541
Go on, all of you!

367
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,833
Uh, my bad. Sorry.

368
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,250
That's not gonna cut it.

369
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,166
I sincerely apologize.

370
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,208
Us, too!

371
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,333
Well, that should
square things, right?

372
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,583
I hope you can
forgive them.

373
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,750
You guys!
Get out of here!

374
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,208
Ma'am! We're going!

375
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,041
All right. So you're their boss?

376
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,875
In that case, you must know all
about the Level Upper, too.

377
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,583
Let's set that aside.

378
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,250
You gave my underlings
a serious working over.

379
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,666
I hope you're prepared
to answer for that.

380
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,625
Prepared to ...

381
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,958
but, uh ...

382
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,541
you just made them
apologize to me.

383
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,500
Well, that was that,
and now this is this.

384
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,916
Honor demands that I pay
you back for what you did.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,458
Let's go!

386
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,000
Whoa! What's happening?

387
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,666
The ground's shifting.

388
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,958
That would be my ability.

389
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,375
It's called Flux Coat.

390
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,541
With it, I have the power

391
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,875
to control the viscosity
of the asphalt.

392
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,416
Whatcha gonna do?

393
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,666
There's nowhere to run.

394
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:22,875
Nice try, girl, but that
attack won't-What the?

395
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,041
She vanished!

396
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,250
That wasn't bad.

397
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,875
Impossible! How are
you staying up there?

398
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,250
An electrical current.

399
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,375
It creates a
magnetic field.

400
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,208
All I have to do is direct it
toward the rebar in the wall.

401
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,125
I'll show you!

402
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,291
Well?

403
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,041
Do you feel like telling
me what you know yet,

404
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,583
or shall we continue?

405
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,333
I see now.

406
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,500
You didn't put all the
power of your ability

407
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,125
into your first
attack, did you?

408
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,750
And just now you
intentionally missed me

409
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,333
with that blast as well.

410
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,375
Exactly.

411
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,125
Now, be a good girl
and tell me...

412
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,250
Screw you! I'm not
declaring defeat yet!

413
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,041
If you call yourself an Esper,
give me your best!

414
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,333
You want to try your
will against mine?

415
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,833
You think a little electric
shock can beat me?

416
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,125
Then go ahead and try.
We'll see who wins!

417
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,458
That sounds like a challenge.

418
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,166
Well, I'm happy to
take you up on it.

419
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,916
Sissy, hold on!

420
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,583
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

421
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,041
No, I really don't
think you do!

422
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,375
Stop, Sissy!

423
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,000
Come on, Uiharu, admit it.

424
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,083
You want to become a
higher level Esper, too.

425
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,750
You know, like
Misaka and Shirai.

426
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,916
Well, having a high ability
level would be pretty awesome,

427
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,458
and it would offer a
lot of opportunities

428
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,500
for academic advancement.

429
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,750
It's why we're here.

430
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,958
If we wanted a normal
school experience,

431
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,708
we could get that
anywhere else.

432
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,291
People flock to this city

433
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,333
because they're fascinated
by Esper powers.

434
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,083
That's the reason it exists.

435
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,916
Before I came here

436
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,250
I wondered what my ability
would turn out to be;

437
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,083
what kind of secret power
I could have hidden in me.

438
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,041
I couldn't sleep the
night before I left

439
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,083
I was so excited
about it all.

440
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,208
And then I had my first
System Scan, and they told me,

441
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,291
"You have absolutely
no discernable talent.

442
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,416
You are a Level
Zero, Saten."

443
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,000
That was hard to hear.

444
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,500
Really hard.

445
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,833
It made me sad.

446
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,125
I know how you feel.

447
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,625
I really do.

448
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,416
I don't have much of an ability
level myself, you know.

449
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,541
I'm a One.

450
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,416
But look at the
friends I've made.

451
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,875
I get to work side
by side with Shirai.

452
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,916
And you and I have
fun all the time.

453
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,416
I mean, if I hadn't
have come here,

454
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,208
I never would have gotten the
chance to meet all of you guys.

455
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,875
So, as far as
I'm concerned,

456
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,875
coming here was a worthwhile
experience if only for that.

457
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,833
Uiharu.

458
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,333
You're adorable!

459
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,458
Sometimes you say the sweetest
things, you know that?

460
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,416
And to say thank you, I'll
sponge bathe your entire body!

461
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,833
That's okay!
I can reach.

462
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,166
I don't need help!

463
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,166
A blackout?

464
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,458
This is why I was trying
to tell you not to do it.

465
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,208
It's not my fault, is it?

466
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,750
How was I supposed to know

467
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,750
that there was something
like this around here?

468
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,125
Like I said,
I knew there was.

469
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,291
You can't just show up at
the last second like that!

470
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,416
And what am I gonna
do about my shoes?

471
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,166
I'd say that's
your problem.

472
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,458
I guess I lost after all.

473
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,291
So much for that plan.

474
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,500
All that and I didn't end
up with any information.

475
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,750
Kuroko!

476
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,000
Come on. We've got a
new problem on our hands.

477
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,916
Hatsuya Kaitabi
is unconscious?

478
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,541
I don't know
all the details.

479
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,375
He suddenly passed out while
Antiskill was questioning him.

480
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,416
Kuroko Shirai, with Judgment.

481
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,000
How is he?

482
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,250
We're doing
everything we can,

483
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,833
but he shows no signs of
regaining consciousness.

484
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,541
Um, well, I don't know

485
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,208
if this could have
something to do with it,

486
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,250
but I punched him
pretty hard in the face.

487
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,791
No. He doesn't exhibit any
significant head trauma.

488
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,750
For that matter, we can't find
anything wrong with him at all.

489
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,375
We looked him
over thoroughly.

490
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,250
He simply lost
consciousness.

491
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,541
So you don't know
what caused it

492
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,041
or how long it will go on.

493
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,375
There is one unusual thing.

494
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,208
This week we've had multiple
patients brought in here

495
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,708
with the same symptoms.

496
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,208
I hate to have
to admit it,

497
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,000
but this is beyond
the capabilities

498
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,041
of this hospital
and its staff.

499
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,750
So, I've called in an
outside specialist

500
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,458
in cerebrophysiology.

501
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,583
Sorry to have
kept you waiting.

502
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,875
I came here at the request

503
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,416
of the Mizuho Systems
Hospital Director.

504
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,625
My name is Harumi Kiyama.

505
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,666
Thank you for coming.

506
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,083
Why are you here?

507
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:42,041
I can't find anything
concrete on the Level Upper.

508
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,291
Maybe it really is nothing
more than just a rumor.

509
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,208
Guess I'll download
some new songs on here.

510
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,666
Is that a hidden link?

511
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,458
Could this be?

512
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,625
The Level Upper
actually exists?

513
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,125
Do people who use it
ever go back to normal?

514
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,458
Huh? I was talking to you.

515
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:09,458
Where did you go?

516
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,541
Saten?
