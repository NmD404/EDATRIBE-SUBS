1
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,500
It looks like those
guys are bothering her.

2
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,916
You think we should call
Judgment and get them down here?

3
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,166
Here we go.

4
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,708
Never a dull moment
in this place.

5
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,333
Lovely Academy City.

6
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,250
Welcome to our
amazing city,

7
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,708
a thriving urban area

8
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,833
with a population of
twenty-three million.

9
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,000
Eighty percent of
which are students.

10
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,250
The city itself is like
a giant experiment,

11
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:13,083
standing at the very forefront
of the scientific community.

12
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,958
It's estimated that the
technology we use here,

13
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,833
is twenty to thirty
years more advanced

14
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,041
than you'll find anywhere
else in the world today.

15
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,291
Now, then.

16
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,625
Can you tell me what all the
students are here to study?

17
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,166
Esper powers!

18
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,041
I can't wait til I
find out my power!

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,500
The city has a tip--top
public safety system,

20
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,166
so you parents will
never have to worry

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,041
about your precious children
while they're here.

22
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,583
Please rest assured that...

23
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,875
Ow.

24
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,708
What was that?

25
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,875
Did we hit something?

26
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,791
The traffic signals are out.

27
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,250
Damn!

28
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,875
Nothing's going right.

29
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:57,875
Who in the world is that?

30
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,583
Hold it right there, punk!

31
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,791
In the name of Judgment!

32
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,083
I was right.
You're the hoodlum

33
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,958
they named in the alert,
aren't you?

34
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,708
It looks like today
isn't your day.

35
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,208
Damn.

36
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,291
This is Kuroko Shirai.

37
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,375
I've just captured
one of the criminals.

38
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,291
Uiharu, where are the remaining
targets to apprehend?

39
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,291
Take a left at the
end of the alley,

40
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,666
then another left five
meters after that.

41
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,041
Copy that! On it!

42
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,708
Halt, in the
name of Judgment!

43
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,708
We've been alerted
to your activities.

44
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,500
Come quietly, or I'll
be forced to....

45
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,625
What happened here?

46
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,708
Oh. Hey, Kuroko.

47
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,083
Sissy!

48
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:58,875
[Music]

49
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,291
Honestly!

50
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,583
How many times do I have to
say it before you understand?

51
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,625
Maintaining the public
safety of Academy City

52
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,458
is a job for Judgment,
not regular citizens.

53
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,000
You can't keep doing that
sort of thing on your own.

54
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,583
Are you listening to me?

55
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,333
Well, Sissy?

56
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,583
I can't help it if I
get there first, can I?

57
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,041
I'm always done by the
time you guys even show up.

58
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,833
You can't just beat
up another student

59
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,708
without authorization.

60
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,625
The city directors get all
twitchy when that happens.

61
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,208
In that case, maybe
you guys should try

62
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,250
getting there a little sooner.

63
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,750
Academy City isn't
living up to its name.

64
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,500
They've got security
posted all over,

65
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,125
but they can't even
eliminate petty criminals.

66
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,791
They can claim to be
scientifically advanced

67
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,500
all they want, but...

68
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,791
Sissy...

69
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,125
Chaser!

70
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,166
I don't see how those advances
really impact our lives.

71
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,833
What am I going
to do with you?

72
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,333
How come you still insist

73
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,041
on wearing those dowdy
shorts under your skirt?

74
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,750
Why were you even looking?

75
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,666
I wear these because
it's easier to...

76
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,791
Trouble detected
with vending machine

77
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,375
seven--one--one--six--five.

78
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,125
Destruction of
property suspected.

79
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,041
Destruction of
property suspected.

80
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,166
Now, was that
really necessary?

81
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,666
You could've gotten
into trouble.

82
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,916
Oh, no.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,791
We're going to
have to hurry.

84
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,541
Hm? Oh. That's right.

85
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,708
We have our System
Scan today, huh?

86
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,750
Those are waves.

87
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,583
A star.

88
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,250
Waves.

89
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,333
Circle.

90
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,708
Next, 38 degrees.

91
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,916
Right.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,791
Off by point two millimeters.

93
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,416
Very good.
Next student please.

94
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,125
Recording 78 meters
and 23 centimeters.

95
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,958
Distance from target,
54 centimeters.

96
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,041
Overall rating, Level 4.

97
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,958
I'm feeling a little bit
off today for some reason.

98
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,291
Maybe my work with Judgment
yesterday exhausted my...

99
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,875
Making excuses for
your poor performance?

100
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,750
Don't you think that's
a little pathetic?

101
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:53,833
Even for you, Shirai.

102
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:54,916
Shut it, Mitsuko Kongo.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,416
At the rate you're going,

104
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,875
it's pretty obvious I'll
reach Level 5 before you do.

105
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,750
-Won't that be exciting?
-Hmph.

106
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,291
I'd greatly appreciate it

107
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,083
if you'd avoid comparing your
abilities with my powers.

108
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,250
The differences between grasping
three--dimensional space

109
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,291
and eleven--dimensional
space are simply...

110
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,666
It will be a nice change.

111
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,083
I've always found it annoying

112
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,208
to have a first--year
student like you

113
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,500
talking down to
someone like me.

114
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,166
She never developed
the ability to listen

115
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,958
to anybody's voice
but her own.

116
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,333
Geez. Was that some
kind of explosion?

117
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,750
Since you transferred in
this term as a second year,

118
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,166
there are probably some gaps in
your knowledge of the school.

119
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,875
A certain student is
having her abilities

120
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,750
tested at the
pool right now.

121
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,916
And she's the real
Ace of Tokiwadai.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,500
If they didn't use the water
in the pool to act as a buffer,

123
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,750
they couldn't accurately
measure her destructive powers.

124
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,166
What do you think?

125
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,416
Are you ready to face one of
those blasts head--on, huh?

126
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,333
Recording initial shot speed

127
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,583
at one--thousand--thirty
meters per second.

128
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,083
Rapid--fire ability,
eight shots per minute.

129
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,791
Pattern grouping,
eighteen point nine millimeters.

130
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,000
Overall rating, Level 5.

131
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,166
Huh? You heard it from
across the school grounds?

132
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,958
It was incredibly loud.

133
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,833
Girls were nearly jumping
out of their skins.

134
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,541
Good grief.

135
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,250
It's so annoying that's the only
way to get an accurate reading.

136
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,083
Sometimes I think an
ability like yours

137
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,375
would be a lot more
convenient than mine.

138
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,583
Isn't it amazing how the
grass is always greener

139
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,000
on the other side?

140
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, yeah, spout all the
platitudes you want to...

141
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,583
Say whatever you want.

142
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,208
It doesn't change the fact
that you're Tokiwadai's Ace.

143
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,750
You can thrust out
your chest with pride

144
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,000
based upon that alone.

145
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,708
The Ace, am I?

146
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,750
Although, I may be wrong.

147
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,250
This small chest of yours
might be too modest

148
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,958
and bashful to be thrust out.

149
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,666
But, oh! It's this very modesty

150
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,833
that lays at the heart of your
undeniable sensuality, Sissy!

151
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,708
This simple yet
elegant temptation

152
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,916
is almost too much
for one girl to bear!

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,500
My poor heart might break!

154
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,125
There's already something
broken in your head.

155
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,333
I was just trying to
bond with you, Sissy.

156
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,458
Shut up!

157
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,291
-Let's see.
-U--i--ha--ru!

158
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, I see that
you're sporting

159
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,083
the light pink
polka--dots today.

160
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,416
I can't believe you!

161
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,625
What do you think
you're doing, Saten?

162
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,958
Oh, come on, just relax.

163
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,166
We're classmates,
aren't we?

164
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,166
There's no need to be
so bashful about it.

165
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,791
Here, let's try again.

166
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,125
It'll make you feel better.

167
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,583
You're awful, you know that?

168
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,708
Sorry, sorry.

169
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,041
I got carried away.

170
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,541
Want to see mine
to even the score?

171
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,000
No, thank you.

172
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,041
Sometimes I think
you're pure evil.

173
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,416
Oh, I forgot.
How'd it go?

174
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,583
How did what go?

175
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,791
Well, what do
you think, silly?

176
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,208
You had your System Scan.

177
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,625
Oh.

178
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,583
An absolute disaster.

179
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,375
I'm still ranked a Level 1,

180
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,291
just like I've always been
way back to grade school.

181
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,333
You should have heard
my homeroom teacher,

182
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,750
"Are those flowers on your
head just for show?

183
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,000
Use their blooming power

184
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,791
to encourage your own
abilities to blossom!"

185
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,958
Oh, wow.

186
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,250
There's so much
in that speech

187
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,166
I could make fun of,
it's too easy.

188
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,583
But, that aside,

189
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,458
try to keep your chin up, 'kay?

190
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,125
Level 1 is a whole lot better
than nothing, if you ask me.

191
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,916
Unlike my pathetic
Level Zero.

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,875
I am officially
incompetent.

193
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,458
Now, now.
Don't worry about me.

194
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,833
I make sure to enjoy every
day as much as I can.

195
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,625
Long as I do that,
it's okay!

196
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,125
That's a good philosophy.

197
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,541
Here. Listen to this.

198
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,583
It'll cheer you up.

199
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,375
It's Hitotsui Hajime!

200
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,000
-What's this song?
-You wouldn't have heard it.

201
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,500
I downloaded the
pre--release early.

202
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,208
The album this song is on
actually goes on sale today.

203
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,833
Do you still buy the CD even
after you've downloaded it?

204
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,250
Of course I do.

205
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,958
But I still like
entering to win stuff

206
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,083
like this limited--release
download.

207
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,958
Because that is the
mark of a true fan!

208
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,250
Now, come with me so
we can buy that CD!

209
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,458
I can't go with you.

210
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,458
I have a meeting with
Kuroko Shirai today.

211
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,208
That name sounds familiar.

212
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,916
Is she that girl who's
in Judgment with you?

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,916
My fondest wish is
about to come true.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,125
Today I'm going to
meet Mikoto Misaka.

215
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,083
She's one of only seven Level
5's in all of Academy City!

216
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,750
The Ace of Tokiwadai!

217
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,250
I think she's amazing!

218
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,041
Really, a Level 5 from
Tokiwadai Middle School?

219
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,708
I bet she's just
another arrogant jerk

220
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,000
who flaunts her power

221
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,583
while looking down her
nose at the rest of us.

222
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,000
No, she's not!

223
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,958
People like her
are all the same.

224
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,458
They treat anyone on the
lower Levels with contempt.

225
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,750
I think they're disgusting.

226
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,000
And she'll be worse since
she's the darling of Tokiwadai.

227
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,291
The darling of Tokiwadai.
I love that!

228
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,041
I get to meet somebody
who's no simple student,

229
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,041
but a darling!

230
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,791
Know what I think?

231
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,833
You're so starry--eyed
over meeting a celebrity

232
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:01,875
that it's addled
your brains.

233
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,291
I'm excited about
meeting her

234
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,291
because I'm sure she's
a very nice person.

235
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,250
And the anticipation hasn't
affected my brain at all!

236
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,916
Hey, I know! Why don't
you come along, Saten?

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,458
I don't really
know about that.

238
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,208
Oh, come on.
It'll be so much fun!

239
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,458
Yeah, maybe, but I just
don't think tha...

240
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,500
You don't get a chance
like this very often!

241
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,791
Hey, I said I wasn't sure!

242
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,250
Let me think a second.

243
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,583
Uiharu!

244
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,375
One of my fans?

245
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,250
She's a girl I
know from Judgment.

246
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,416
She takes care of my backup
at the 177th Branch.

247
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,541
She's a big supporter.

248
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,958
She's always asking
to meet you,

249
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,000
even if it's only
for a few minutes.

250
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,375
Now Sissy, I know
that lately your fans

251
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,458
have been becoming more
and more annoying

252
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,750
and you have little enough
patience for meeting them.

253
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,875
But I think you'll find
that Uiharu is different.

254
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,416
She's a reasonable,
polite girl.

255
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,458
Besides which,
she's one of the few people

256
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,291
I actually consider
my friend.

257
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,875
So, really I'm asking
you to do it for me.

258
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,333
And since I know
how busy you are,

259
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,791
I've taken the
liberty of arranging

260
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,375
an orderly schedule
for the day.

261
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,291
I'm pretty sure you'll
find it to your liking.

262
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,958
Hey!

263
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,333
Let's see,
what have we here?

264
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,125
"Date plan with Sissy
using Uiharu as a ruse.

265
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,291
Part one, foster friendship
at a family restaurant.

266
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,750
Part two, lingerie shopping.

267
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,083
Purchase 'big
moment' underwear.

268
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,750
Part three, shopping
at a perfume store.

269
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,250
Purchase aphrodisiac.

270
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,625
Ditch Uiharu and
go to an upscale

271
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,625
but discreet
hotel with Sissy."

272
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,875
In other words, you're
just using this reasonable,

273
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,291
polite girl you
call your friend

274
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,500
in order to fulfill your
own perverted desires.

275
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,583
Is that right?

276
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,250
Not really.

277
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,291
I thought you were trying to
make my life less stressful!

278
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,125
You've got it all wrong,
Sissy I swear.

279
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,458
It wasn't like that.

280
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,791
Owowowowowow!

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,625
Even so...

282
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,500
You say she's a friend
of yours, Kuroko,

283
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,916
so what choice is there?

284
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,625
Oh, my!

285
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,791
Sissy! Sweet Sissy!

286
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,583
Kuroko...

287
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,500
At last you reveal how deeply
you care about my happiness!

288
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,958
I could die!

289
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:53,791
I could die right now
from hearing that!

290
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,416
Excuse me, miss ...

291
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,125
Ah, Sissy, my heart is about to
burst! I can't contain myself!

292
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,583
I'm terribly sorry,

293
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,000
but you're beginning to
frighten the other customers.

294
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,916
Now that that's
out of the way,

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,083
it's time to get to
the introductions.

296
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,250
This is Kazari Uiharu
from Judgment.

297
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,583
She's a first--year at
Sakugawa Middle School.

298
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,958
Oh! Pleased to meet you!

299
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,125
I mean, it's really an honor.

300
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,625
And this is?

301
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,666
Hi there. My name's Ruiko Saten,

302
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,125
a classmate of Uiharu's.

303
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,666
She decided to drag
me along with her,

304
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,166
so here I am.

305
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,541
And by the way my power
rating is Level Zero.

306
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,958
So there!

307
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,166
Saten, why would
you say that?

308
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,291
Well, hello, Uiharu.

309
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,250
Saten.

310
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,333
I'm another friend
of Kuroko's.

311
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,083
Misaka.

312
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,041
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

313
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,125
Yes, yes, such a pleasure.

314
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,833
Okay, the introductions
have been completed

315
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,208
without incident.

316
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,916
The timetable has been
thrown off somewhat,

317
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,208
but I've made this
schedule for today

318
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,666
that I think should
work for every...

319
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,375
Okay.

320
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,291
Well, standing around here
isn't very much fun, is it?

321
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,708
I have an idea.

322
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,916
Let's go to the arcade.

323
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,583
Go to the arcade?

324
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,791
What do you think?

325
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,958
Come on, Kuroko.

326
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,083
Let's go.

327
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,166
I think it's
beneath you, Sissy.

328
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,625
I guess playing
games in the arcade

329
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,458
and browsing magazines
is fun enough,

330
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,458
but shouldn't you have some
more dignified hobbies?

331
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,208
You could try arranging
flowers, maybe,

332
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,666
-or playing the harp.
-Here you go.

333
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,750
Please. Why should
I waste my time

334
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,250
stuffing flowers in a vase

335
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,666
or learning an instrument
no one knows how to play?

336
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,583
Please, take one.
Have a good afternoon!

337
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,041
You know something.

338
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,666
She doesn't act like
some arrogant celebrity.

339
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,416
Yeah and she doesn't look down
her nose at us at all, either.

340
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,708
What's on the flyer?

341
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,666
It looks like there's a
new crepe stand opening,

342
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,083
and the first one
hundred customers

343
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,458
get a Gekota figurine
as a free gift.

344
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,416
Now that's one cheesy
looking character.

345
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,000
I mean, who would go for
something like that these days?

346
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,750
Oh, sorry.

347
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,333
Is there something wrong?

348
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,458
What's the hold up, Sissy?

349
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,583
Something the matter?

350
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,083
Oh, I see.

351
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,333
You're interested in the
new crepe stand, aren't you?

352
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,833
Or something else?

353
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,333
Is it the free giveaway
they're offering

354
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,708
that caught your eye?

355
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,208
No! I don't know what
you're talking about.

356
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,416
Why would I care about
this Gekota guy?

357
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,791
I mean, he's just a frog,
a stupid amphibian.

358
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,083
What kind of girl
would be interested in

359
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,708
some dumb thing like that?

360
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,500
Wow.

361
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,583
There are so many people.

362
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,208
What's with all the
kids running around?

363
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,000
Remember our break will
only be one hour long.

364
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,208
Everybody please
stay close.

365
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,500
You don't want
to miss the bus.

366
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,541
It's some kind of tour.

367
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,333
We must have bad timing.

368
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,916
I'll go see if I can find
a free bench to save for us.

369
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,041
Oh, then, why don't
I go with you?

370
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,750
Saten, we're finding
a place to sit.

371
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,166
Will you get
something for us?

372
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,916
Don't worry, we'll pay
you back for it later.

373
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,083
-Thanks a lot!
-Huh? Wait-

374
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,500
Huh? What's wrong?

375
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,083
Nothing.

376
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,291
Would you like to
switch places with me?

377
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,333
No, it doesn't matter
to me who goes first.

378
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,375
We're just here for crepes,

379
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,250
so as long as I get one,
I'm fine.

380
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,791
All right!
I got a Gekota!

381
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,791
-So did I!
-So did I!

382
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,250
Thank you for waiting.

383
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,083
Here's your free gift.

384
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,625
You're lucky.
It's the last one we have.

385
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,666
Great, thank you.

386
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,458
Oh, hold on.
The last, you said?

387
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,000
Um, Misaka ...

388
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,125
It's all yours
if you'd like it.

389
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,875
Are you sure?
You really mean it?

390
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,250
Yeah, no problem.

391
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,000
Thank you so much!

392
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,958
Y... you're welcome.

393
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,541
Come on, Sissy,
just try one bite.

394
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,916
-You know you want to!
-I said I don't want any!

395
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,333
Who chooses anchovies
as a topping, anyway?

396
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,416
Open wide and
say, "Aaahhhh."

397
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,458
No, just leave
me alone already!

398
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,458
She's nice, isn't she?

399
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,958
Misaka, I mean.

400
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,916
Not at all what you'd expect
for somebody so well known.

401
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,041
She's not stuck up at all.

402
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,541
Just approachable
and friendly.

403
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,708
You sure about that?

404
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,250
Here.

405
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,208
-Uh, what?
-Would you like to taste it?

406
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,833
Go on try some as a
thank you for before.

407
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,625
Absolutely not!

408
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,041
I won't stand
for this, Sissy!

409
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,583
I'm right here, yet you
offer somebody else

410
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:07,875
what is rightfully mine?

411
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,416
I'm not sure I can keep
up with your friends.

412
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,875
They're so energetic.

413
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,625
Huh?

414
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,041
It's nothing.

415
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,125
I was just noticing
that bank over there.

416
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,916
Why would the security
shutters be down

417
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,250
in the middle of the day?

418
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,625
What was that crash?

419
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,291
Uiharu, I want you
to contact Antiskill

420
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,875
and request some officers to
our location right away.

421
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:34,541
Yeah, I'm on it!

422
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,583
Wait up, Kuroko!

423
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,375
No you don't.

424
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,750
Stay right where you are.

425
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,458
Like I've told you a
million times,

426
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,416
public safety is the concern
of those of us in Judgment.

427
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,125
Please do me a favor and just
behave yourself this time.

428
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,291
Yes, that's correct.

429
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,958
There's a bank
robbery in progress

430
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,416
across from the public square
on the edge of District 7.

431
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,833
Requesting Antiskill.

432
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,916
Come on, you idiots.

433
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,333
-We've gotta move it, or...
-Stop right there!

434
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,875
I am a Judgment officer,

435
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,333
and I am placing
you under arrest

436
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,583
for destruction of
property and bank robbery.

437
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,041
Who does this
kid think she is?

438
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,125
Judgment must be
short--staffed.

439
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,041
Hey, little lady.

440
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,833
You should find
somewhere else to play,

441
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,416
or you could end
up getting hurt.

442
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,083
Is that the most intimidating
line you can come up with?

443
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,291
You're not much of a
professional, are you?

444
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,958
-Wha-?
-Damn brat!

445
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,083
She's amazing!

446
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,583
That's Kuroko for you.

447
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,875
Please, stay here.

448
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,375
It's not safe to leave
the square right now.

449
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,458
-Let go!
-What's wrong here?

450
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,750
Misaka!

451
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,791
We're missing one of the
boys who was on the tour!

452
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,041
He said he left
something on the bus,

453
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,166
and then he went
to look for it.

454
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,041
All right. Uiharu and I
will see what we can...

455
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,416
I want to help, too!

456
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,083
All right, then.

457
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,458
Let's split up
and look for him.

458
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,375
It's too late to back
down, now, girlie.

459
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,333
A pyrokineticist?

460
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,208
All right.

461
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,291
-Hey, watch it!
-Don't run away from me!

462
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,000
Run away?

463
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,875
-She's gone!
-Who says I'm running?

464
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,041
What? She's a teleporter?

465
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,291
You should probably
stop resisting me.

466
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,291
Or I'll take
drastic measures.

467
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,958
Like teleporting this directly
into your body, for example.

468
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,083
Find anything?

469
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,708
No, nothing!

470
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,125
Where in the world has
that kid disappeared to?

471
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,750
What do we have here?

472
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,250
Perfect! You're
coming with me.

473
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,958
What are you
doing, mister?

474
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,708
-Who are you?
-Never mind, just move it.

475
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,791
Hurry up!

476
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,041
I have to stop him.

477
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,916
Maybe we should have another
look around the square.

478
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,833
Hey! What do you want?

479
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,500
Go away!

480
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,333
Let go!

481
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,875
Damn it!

482
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,250
He hurt Saten!

483
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,125
Kuroko!

484
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,750
From here on out, this fight
is a personal one for me.

485
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,708
I hate to do this,
but it's too late.

486
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,541
I'm going to have
to get involved now.

487
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,541
Crap, I just remembered.

488
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,375
They say there's this
scary girl in Judgment.

489
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,875
She's a teleporter who will
beat you up inside and out

490
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,250
until you wish that
you'd never been born.

491
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,250
I don't know what
you're talking about.

492
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,375
Damn her!

493
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm not gonna
turn tail and run.

494
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,750
What's even worse,

495
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,083
apparently this teleporter has
given herself, heart and soul,

496
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,958
to a powerful electromaster.

497
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,000
Go ahead.

498
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,541
I'm happy to take
you out, too.

499
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,833
That's right.

500
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,833
That girl over there is
one of the most powerful

501
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:53,208
of the twenty--three
million people in the city.

502
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,750
Out of the seven Level 5's,
she's ranked third.

503
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,583
Railgun.

504
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,833
Mikoto Misaka.

505
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,500
My Sissy.

506
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,125
The pride and joy of
Tokiwadai Middle School.

507
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,000
The ultimate, unstoppable
shock princess!

508
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,708
Wow.

509
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,041
That was incredible.

510
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:46,416
There were zero injuries
among the general population.

511
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,083
Please, keep walking forward
in an orderly fashion.

512
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,041
Your pyrotechnic abilities
weren't all that bad, you know.

513
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,083
Unless I miss my guess,
you'd be right around a Level 3.

514
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,333
You probably got caught up in
the excitement of your powers

515
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,666
and went down
the wrong path.

516
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,083
Take a good look at yourself

517
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,916
and the consequences
of your actions,

518
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and maybe you can
make a fresh start.

519
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:12,583
You were great!

520
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,791
Thank you so much!

521
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,666
No, really.
It's nothing.

522
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,708
I don't how I can
ever repay you.

523
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,166
Thank the nice lady.

524
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,208
Thank you for helping
me, nice lady!

525
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,458
You handled that situation
pretty well, Saten.

526
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,541
-Really?
-Yeah.

527
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,375
I think it was downright
heroic of you.

528
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,625
-You, too, Misaka.
-There you are, Sissyyyyyyy!

529
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,041
Kuroko, let go of me!

530
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,250
-You're making a scene!
-There you are, Saten!

531
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,291
Look at your face!
Are you hurt badly?

532
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,708
Oh, no. I'm okay, really.

533
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,291
It looks bad.
Are you sure?

534
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,833
Misaka's so brave.

535
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,125
She was the real hero today.

536
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,458
That's it.
I've had enough!

00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:07,250
[Music]

538
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:33,166
My idol Misaka was great today.

539
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,250
She sure was.

540
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,458
Saten, stop it.

541
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:37,041
What are you pouring
water on my head for?

542
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,666
We don't want your
flowers to wither.

543
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,333
You need to be
ready for next time!
