1
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,833
You understand nothing!

2
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,083
I would do anything
to save them...

3
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,208
anything in the
entire world!

4
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,500
The whole city can
hate and revile me.

5
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't care! I'm not going
to let anything stop me now!

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,333
Hey... what's wrong?

7
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,416
Oh, gosh...

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,291
what's that?

9
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,416
A fetus...?

10
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:13,083
[Music]

11
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,083
It's no use.

12
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,458
Every single camera
has gone dead.

13
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,541
My phone's not going
through, either.

14
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,541
Kuroko!

15
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,250
I can't just leave
Sissy alone out there!

16
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,291
How can you help her
with all these injuries?

17
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,458
Well, I....

18
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,041
You need to have more
faith in Misaka...

19
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,541
I'm sure she
can handle it.

20
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,208
A fetus...?

21
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,500
Is this the
"Metamorphose" skill?

22
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,875
I've heard about it.

23
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,166
I guess it's real.

24
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,750
This is bad...

25
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,166
It's getting bigger.

26
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,750
Hurry, Misaka!

27
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,416
Why are you here, Uiharu?!

28
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,791
Uiharu! You okay?

29
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,916
Yes... I'm fine.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're lucky.

31
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,791
You shouldn't have
come down here!

32
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,791
Yeah... I'm sorry.

33
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,166
-But, I...
-Just stay there.

34
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,041
I'm not sure what
this thing is,

35
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,000
but if it wants a fight,
it can have one.

36
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,250
It's not after me.

37
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,208
What, then? Is it just
on a random rampage?

38
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,166
Look at it.

39
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,458
It's almost like it's
in pain or something.

40
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,875
-What's happening?
-The patients...!

41
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,416
They all suddenly
started going berserk.

42
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,750
We don't know why!

43
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,291
Have they regained
consciousness?

44
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,208
No... They were in the same
comatose state as usual.

45
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,125
-And then, this.
-All at the same time?

46
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,708
As if on cue...

47
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,750
They're all exhibiting
the same symptoms...

48
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,708
They haven't regained
conscious--ness;

49
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,500
it's more like they're
all experiencing

50
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,458
the same horrible dream.

51
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,833
Good grief!

52
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,833
What the hell is going on?

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,625
Hey, what is that thing?

54
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,875
A monster?

55
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,291
Some new kind
of bio--weapon?

56
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,958
We'll have to do what we
can with the men we have left.

57
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,250
Use of live ammo
is authorized...

58
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,125
Fire!

59
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,375
Look...!

60
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,291
I think...
it's getting bigger!

61
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,583
How incredible.

62
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,708
Who would've thought
something like that

63
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,083
could ever be created...?

64
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,625
I can just imagine
the recognition

65
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,166
I'll get from academia.

66
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,958
The network is utterly out
of my hands at this point.

67
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,625
That's it...

68
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,708
I no longer have any hope of
bringing back all those children

69
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,000
I helped to destroy...

70
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,875
They're lost forever.

71
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,916
Please! You can't give up now!

72
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,791
Is that an AIM
diffusion field?

73
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,666
It's most likely a
collection of them...

74
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,250
Yes, that's it...

75
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,750
Although I think it
would be more appropriate

76
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,291
to call it an AIM burst.

77
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,750
The AIM diffusion fields
of ten thousand people...

78
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,041
all bundled up together
within the Level Upper network.

79
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,375
They acted as the catalyst

80
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:43,791
to bring to life a monster
of latent consciousness.

81
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,208
Simply stated...

82
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,625
That thing up there

83
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,166
is a collection of ten
thousand children's thoughts.

84
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,458
Academy City...

85
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,083
all my dreams were going
to come true here...

86
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,458
I was going to be
a powerful esper.

87
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,458
But now...

88
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,416
My dreams have
become a nightmare.

89
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,291
It doesn't matter
how hard I try...

90
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,875
In this city,
if you have no talent,

91
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,333
you have no power.

92
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,375
So I'm stuck with my miserable,
ordinary life...

93
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,708
A life where every day
means being beaten down,

94
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,958
taken advantage of,
or simply ignored.

95
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,625
So what can I do?

96
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,375
I have no choice but to
get my hands on it...

97
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,500
I can't keep
living like this...

98
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,750
I'm so tired of
being powerless.

99
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,041
In a way...
I pity it.

100
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,583
What now? How do we
go about stopping it?

101
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,708
You're asking me
that question...?

102
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,666
It makes no difference
what I say...

103
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,916
You'll never trust me.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,500
Then what about this...?

105
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,791
You're the one who took my
handcuffs off, aren't you?

106
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,750
That doesn't
mean anything...

107
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,125
You can't possibly trust
me just because of that.

108
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,208
That's not all.

109
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,166
I know you're sincere

110
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,833
about wanting to help bring
those children back...

111
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,791
I can hear it
in your voice.

112
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,916
I trust you.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,041
I completely trust
you, Teacher.

114
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,625
You heard it, too?

115
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,541
There might be a way.

116
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,916
Think about it...

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,708
The AIM burst is a monster

118
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,875
created by the
Level Upper network...

119
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,500
If the network were
brought down somehow,

120
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,875
that might stop it.

121
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,416
The Level Upper
treatment program!

122
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,833
It might not work but it's
worth a shot at least.

123
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,791
I'll find a way to
handle that thing...

124
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,208
While I'm doing that,

125
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,583
You get that chip and
whatever's on it to Antiskill.

126
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,041
Right, let's do it!

127
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,833
Incredible...

128
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,125
There are still
people out there

129
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,458
who are willing to trust
without any reason to.

130
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,250
Captain!

131
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,083
No... No...!

132
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,958
No...! Stay away!

133
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,916
What were you just
standing there for?

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,708
That monster
could've killed you!

135
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,250
Uh... who are you?

136
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,708
A civilian
shouldn't be here!

137
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,375
It's too dangerous!

138
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,583
Geez...

139
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,500
Everybody just has to
call me a civilian.

140
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,208
It's starting to get old.

141
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,625
Whatever, just get away
from here right now!

142
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,458
You're the one who
should get going...

143
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,666
That thing won't
come this way

144
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,750
unless you provoke it
with more shooting.

145
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,833
Even so...

146
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,083
We can't just stand down
and do nothing either.

147
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,208
Do you know what
that is over there?

148
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,291
An experimental
nuclear reactor.

149
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,458
What?!

150
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,333
Hey, what's
that girl doing?

151
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,000
That's her!

152
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,291
The girl Kiyama
held hostage.

153
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,500
She sure is taking
her time getting away.

154
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,333
She's not.

155
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,666
Uiharu's not being held
against her will anymore,

156
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,958
and she's not
getting away.

157
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,333
I need to ask a favor.

158
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,958
From now on, you're
going to be facing me.

159
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,333
Geez...!

160
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,958
You're not going to make
this easy, are you?

161
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,333
No!

162
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,750
Thank goodness!
It's not broken.

163
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,833
I have to hurry...

164
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,791
Or it will be too
late for everyone.

165
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,833
I can do this...

166
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,541
I'm a member of Judgment.

167
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,666
For them.

168
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,041
And for Saten!

169
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,375
You okay?

170
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,791
Honestly!

171
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,083
You kids these days do
the craziest things.

172
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,333
Do you have the
treatment program?

173
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,666
Yes, it's safe.

174
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,875
We'll cover you...

175
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,666
Hurry!

176
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,208
Damn! Another one.

177
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,791
Didn't you hear
what I told you?

178
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,541
I said, you're
going to face me.

179
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,291
I'm your biggest
problem now.

180
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,708
So stop just standing there,
looking all creepy....

181
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,791
Go on, make a move!

182
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,083
Come after me, already!

183
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,291
By broadcasting the vaccine file
throughout Academy City...

184
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,291
you will bring down the
Level Upper network.

185
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,208
If the flower--haired
girl can manage that...

186
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,791
It should succeed in
bringing the runaway

187
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,958
AIM burst under control...

188
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,166
However...

189
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,250
It's starting to feel like
this could go on forever...

190
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,708
Sheesh!

191
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,833
What do you want with a
nuclear power facility anyway?

192
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,875
This is straight out
of a monster movie!

193
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,458
Oh, yeah?...

194
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,125
a collection of ten thousand
children's thoughts...

195
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, no!

196
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,875
Yes, that's right.

197
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,041
We're out of time.

198
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,708
Take the file I'm sending

199
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,958
and broadcast it by all means
possible throughout the city!

200
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,708
All right.
The transfer is complete!

201
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,916
I'll take responsibility...

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,166
Just play it right now!

203
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,916
What is that?

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,958
Doctor...! Look
at the patients!

205
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,333
Whatever I have to do,

206
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,125
I absolutely cannot allow it
to come any closer than this.

207
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,166
Music?

208
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,166
What is that?

209
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,708
Crap!

210
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,375
It won't matter how
many times I hit it

211
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,708
if it just keeps
regenerating.

212
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,958
It's not growing back.

213
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,250
That music must be the
treatment program...!

214
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,541
You did it, Uiharu!

215
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,875
Sorry about this...

216
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,833
but it's game
over for you now!

217
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,833
That was a closer
fight than I like.

218
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,083
Don't relax.

219
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,708
This isn't over yet!

220
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:09,083
Hey...! What do you
think you're doing here?

221
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,666
No way!

222
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,333
The network may
have been disrupted,

223
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,083
but remember, that's a mass of
ten thousand people's thoughts,

224
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,750
created by AIM
diffusion fields.

225
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,916
You can't think about it
like an ordinary creature.

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,958
This isn't what
we bargained for.

227
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,000
What am I supposed
to do, huh?

228
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,708
The nucleus!

229
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,333
There has to be a nucleus

230
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,416
where the fields have become
embedded somewhere inside.

231
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,416
That's the key...!

232
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,041
Find a way to destroy it.

233
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,333
Is that it?

234
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,958
Was that Saten?

235
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,416
Are Level Zeroes
permanently defective?

236
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,166
That's what they think.

237
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,625
I can't stand it.

238
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,333
It's hopeless...

239
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,541
As a Level Zero...

240
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,375
What's happening?

241
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,750
You probably...

242
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,666
wouldn't understand......

243
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,083
how miserable
every day is for us.

244
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,291
You come here with
so many expectations,

245
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,833
and then... nothing.

246
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,916
Stand back now...

247
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,541
Where you are,
you might get hit.

248
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,083
What do I care...?

249
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,666
I'm responsible for
creating that creature...

250
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,166
Maybe you don't care.

251
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,208
But what about the
students you taught?

252
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,750
Once we save them,

253
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,500
don't you think it's your face
they're gonna want to see?

254
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,375
I'll help you
save the children...

255
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,625
but I won't
help you die...

256
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,250
You shouldn't
give up so easily.

257
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,166
Got it?

258
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:29,291
I don't want you tangled
up in that thing.

259
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,041
I'm the one who's going
to tangle with it...

260
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,375
Right about now!

261
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:35,875
Incredible...

262
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,375
Is that the same kind
of induction field

263
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,791
I was using before...?

264
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,583
With power like hers...

265
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,166
maybe this will work.

266
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,416
The lightning isn't
hitting it directly.

267
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,916
But the heat from the electrical
impedance she's forcing on it

268
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,666
is blasting its body away.

269
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,000
When she was fighting
me earlier...

270
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,791
that wasn't her
full power at all.

271
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,125
Forgive me...

272
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,833
Anyone......

273
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,166
would want to be......

274
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,125
an esper...

275
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,083
I should have realized
so much sooner.

276
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,791
What's the use anymore?

277
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,500
I'll always be nothing.

278
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,750
There's no point.

279
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,083
I know how hard
you were trying.

280
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,500
I was so tired of not
having any power...

281
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,666
And finally, it
didn't matter anymore

282
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,625
what lengths I had
to go to to get it.

283
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,208
I understand.

284
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,625
But this doesn't
have to be it.

285
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,166
You can keep trying.

286
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,833
Don't stay here and let
yourself be defeated.

287
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,333
You are not defective.

288
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,333
There's nothing
wrong with you.

289
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,125
So... don't give up!

290
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,708
So that's it...

291
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,375
That's a Level 5.

292
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,375
It... worked.

293
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,416
Inspection of
experimental reactor core

294
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,208
and surrounding
area is complete.

295
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,291
Nothing out of the ordinary.

296
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,500
Roger.

297
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,791
Do an additional sweep

298
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,125
to make sure no one was
injured in the area.

299
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,125
Wait... uh...

300
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,750
What now...?

301
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,875
What do we do?

302
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,333
About the children, I mean.

303
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,041
I have no intention
of giving up.

304
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,625
I'll just have
to try again.

305
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,000
It doesn't matter whether
I'm in a laboratory

306
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,458
or a prison cell.

307
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,000
They can lock me up but they
can't stop me from planning.

308
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,291
However...

309
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,083
I'm still not going to be
choosy about my methods...

310
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,666
If you don't like the
plan I come up with,

311
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,666
you'll have to come
and stop me again.

312
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,708
Good grief.

313
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,750
She's never gonna
learn, is she?

314
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,916
-Sissy! Sissy! Sissy!!
-Oh... Kuroko...

315
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,333
I was worried about you!

316
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,458
My heart was aching
the whole time...!

317
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,000
And look at you:
hair messed up,

318
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,958
scrapes and bruises
all over your skin!

319
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,625
And I'm guessing you don't
have the strength left

320
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,083
to shock, either...

321
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,666
I think I'll take
this time to examine

322
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,333
every inch of your
body for injuries

323
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,500
and rub the soreness
from your limbs.

324
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,791
Oh, I almost forgot.

325
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,416
I received a message from
the hospital with good news.

326
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,750
It looks like all the people
who used the Level Upper

327
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,333
are beginning to
regain consciousness.

328
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,416
And we have you to
thank for that...

329
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,958
Good job.

330
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,041
Now then, Sissy, let's
pick up where we left off.

331
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,375
What are you doing?
Knock it off!

332
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,875
I swear, if you don't
stop this second...

333
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,833
There you are!

334
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,416
Oh, hey, Uiharu!

335
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,291
Don't "oh, hey" me!

336
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,833
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

337
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,125
Why aren't you
in your room...?

338
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,791
Are you sure you should
be out of bed so soon?

339
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,875
There could still
be something wrong.

340
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,291
You were in a coma!

341
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,708
I just took a long
nap, that's all...

342
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,500
I'm totally back
to normal now.

343
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,833
Including not having
any kind of ability.

344
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,875
What is it?

345
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,458
I'm sorry...

346
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,041
for getting hung up
on stupid stuff...

347
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,708
and for keeping
secrets from you...

348
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,791
and for putting you
through all of this.

349
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,500
You don't have to...

350
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,625
But I am...

351
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,333
I came so close...

352
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,708
So close to losing something
far more important to me

353
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,375
than some stupid ability.

354
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,666
Oh, yeah...

355
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,666
I almost forgot.

356
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,791
I'm back!!

357
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,291
What did you do that for?

358
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,250
Get back to your
bed right now!

359
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,375
I was just thanking you
for taking care of me!

360
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,875
Though, I think
you should know,

361
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,333
even your panties
are covered in mud.

362
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,000
That settles it. Things are
officially back to normal.

363
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,250
How can you say that?

364
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,416
After everything
I've done,

365
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,791
you're insulting
my underwear?!

366
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,083
Is something
bothering you?

367
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,375
Huh...? No, it's nothing.

368
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,541
"Can we really
blame the people

369
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,541
who used the Level Upper for
making the choice they did?"

370
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,541
"Maybe we're responsible
for all of this;

371
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,958
we espers, who didn't realize
how much pain they were in,

372
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,625
how hard it must
be to live here

373
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,625
and not have an ability."

374
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,791
That's what you
were thinking,

375
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,000
or something
along those lines.

376
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,875
Am I right?

377
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,125
Don't mimic me...

378
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,875
It's creepy.

379
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:51,000
That kind of compassion
is just like you, Sissy.

380
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,875
And while we're on the
topic of compassion,

381
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,041
there's one other thing

382
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,500
I wish you would give
some thought to...

383
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,666
and that is...

384
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,791
My feelings...

385
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,500
I deserve some
love too, don't I?

386
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,166
I should thank
you, Kuroko...

387
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,125
Your unrelentingly,

388
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,166
unapologetically
perverted nature

389
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,458
is giving me some
of my strength back.

390
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,000
-I'm serious here, Saten!
-You are gonna get it...!

391
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,583
Careful, Misaka!

392
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,333
Oh, dear! Shirai,
are you all right?

393
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:19,916
Some things never
change, huh?

394
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,958
[Music]

395
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,666
After all we just
went through,

396
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,000
isn't this kind of a
cheap thing to do?

397
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,083
What are you talking about?

398
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,416
A swimsuit episode
is perfect.

399
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,916
Here, tell me which
one you like better...

400
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,416
-Sissy, look!
-I don't want to!
