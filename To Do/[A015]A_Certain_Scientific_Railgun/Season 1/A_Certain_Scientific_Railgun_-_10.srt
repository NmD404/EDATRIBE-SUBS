1
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,166
All I could do before
was lift a paper cup.

2
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,041
This is the most
amazing thing ever!

3
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,166
Ruiko...?

4
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,166
It's happening...

5
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,583
I'm doing something.

6
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,375
How could you drop
me like that, Akemi?!

7
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,750
Hey, easy!
C'mon, just let her go!

8
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,250
-That was so uncool!
-Ouch, you're hurting me!

9
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,625
It's not much...

10
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,916
nothing like what Shirai
and Misaka can do...

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,416
but it's something...

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,791
finally...

13
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,375
After all this time,
I'm an esper now, too.

14
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,666
I can't believe it...!

15
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,916
It's too good to be
true...! but it is!

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,958
[Music]

17
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,083
There. All done.

18
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,250
Being able to level up

19
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,583
just by simply
listening to a song...

20
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,041
How can something like
that even be possible?

21
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,083
I don't fully
understand it, either,

22
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,458
but that's what our
informant told me.

23
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,958
Well I'm not sure
I believe it.

24
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,458
But what if I
did listen to it

25
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,083
and became an even stronger
esper than you are...?

26
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,208
That would
certainly open up

27
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,916
a whole world of
possibilities to me.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,250
And what would these
possibilities be?

29
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,541
Perhaps you should go
ahead and give it a try

30
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,916
so we can find out.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,791
Ah I'm kidding...!
Just kidding...

32
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,625
I would never do
that, I promise!

33
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,000
Hear that...?

34
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,750
Sounds like your
phone is ringing.

35
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,250
Yes...

36
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,458
Yes... I understand....

37
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,166
It seems we've got another
situation on our hands...

38
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,375
Contact Dr. Kiyama,
will you, please?

39
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,750
Yeah, I'm on it.

40
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,666
Yes. The item has
already arrived.

41
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,541
Can it really be
possible for someone

42
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,000
to raise their ability level
by listening to a song?

43
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,125
That is the question, huh?

44
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,916
With a Testament maybe.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,833
Using a Testament?

46
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,625
Do you have such a device?

47
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,125
Oh...

48
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,500
Yes...

49
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,458
yes...

50
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,500
You don't say...

51
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,416
Okay, thanks
for everything.

52
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,916
I wonder if we could be
barking up the wrong tree

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,625
with this music idea.

54
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,333
Oh, Saten, I'm so
glad you answered...

55
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,166
The phone you have dialed is
either out of signal range

56
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,958
or has been turned off...

57
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,625
Please try your
call again later.

58
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,375
Pretty impressive power,
dontcha think?

59
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,458
The Level Upper
strikes again, huh?

60
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,958
You wanna mess with me...?

61
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,041
Go ahead and try it.

62
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,125
See what happens.

63
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,708
This must be pretty
embarrassing for you.

64
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,875
Bring it.

65
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,250
I'll show you my power!

66
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,083
Man... I wish these creeps
would give up already!

67
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,375
Okay, this is gonna
sting a bit...

68
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,125
It seems like you're getting
bruised up every day.

69
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,416
There are so many people
using Level Uppers now,

70
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,750
it doesn't seem like I
have much of a choice.

71
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,666
I wish there was some way
we could figure out

72
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,833
how far this craze was
spreading, y'know?

73
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,791
Wishing won't do any good.

74
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,250
This is going
to take work.

75
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,625
We need a plan...

76
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,791
There are three
things I think

77
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,125
we should be doing about this.

78
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,958
First, we get the
item off the street,

79
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,458
and then we help those
who've fallen into a coma.

80
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,125
And then...

81
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,791
We arrest whoever
is responsible.

82
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,583
We'll find out who
created this thing

83
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,958
and made it available.

84
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,500
And somehow or another,

85
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:02,250
we'll learn what their true
motive was for doing it.

86
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,583
Well... let's get you
taken care of first.

87
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,625
Are you sure you
wouldn't rather have

88
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,458
Misaka wrap you up, though?

89
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,208
I would just as soon not have
anybody see me like this,

90
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,625
much less my Sissy.

91
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,583
I promise Shirai, nobody
wants to see you like this.

92
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,208
Hey, guys! I just
wanted to see

93
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,125
if there was anything
I could do-

94
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,541
Oh... Hey, Sissy...

95
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,916
great to see you.

96
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,625
So, are you guys making
any progress with the case?

97
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,333
Hard to say...

98
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,416
We have uncovered some
new information...

99
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,250
From what
Dr. Kiyama tells us,

100
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,125
there's a certain
device called a Testament,

101
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,541
which is able to electrically

102
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,666
input a large quantity of data
directly into the brain.

103
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,708
However, it operates using
all of the five human senses.

104
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,416
Taste, touch, hearing,
smell and sight:

105
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,333
all are at work
with this thing.

106
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,666
But we know the Level Upper
is a music file,

107
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,000
so the only sense that
it uses is hearing.

108
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,916
We searched the rooms
of all the users

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
who are now in
vegetative states,

110
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,083
but we didn't come up
with any relevant data

111
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,416
other than the song.

112
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,416
Okay let's look at
this hypothetically...

113
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,750
Do you think
there's any way

114
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,875
the song could have an
effect on all five senses,

115
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,083
instead of just hearing?

116
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,125
I don't really understand.

117
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,875
Remember that
conversation we had

118
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,500
when we were eating
the shaved ice?

119
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,750
Let me see...

120
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,833
About brain freezes?

121
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,583
No that's not what I meant.

122
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,375
It's synesthesia!

123
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,708
Synes--what?

124
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,833
Something we were talking
about the other day...

125
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,666
It's what occurs when a
single thing stimulates

126
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,375
more than one
of the senses.

127
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,583
You stimulate one sense
with a particular method,

128
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,041
and others react too,

129
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,291
even though those senses
weren't the original targets.

130
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,666
So in this case,
do you mean

131
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,708
by stimulating the
senses using sound,

132
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,750
you could get
the same effect

133
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,000
you would get by
using a Testament?

134
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes, it is a possibility.

135
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,333
I had overlooked
that until now.

136
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,041
Would you mind pursuing that
avenue of investigation?

137
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,708
Yeah... and in this case,

138
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,166
I should even be able
to get permission

139
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,833
to use Tree Diagram.

140
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,625
Tree Diagram, really?!..

141
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,708
Academy City's
greatest supercomputer

142
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,916
should speed things up!

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,875
I'll be in touch once
I have the results.

144
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,416
Would you mind if I headed
over there right now...?

145
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,625
I'd love the chance to
see Tree Diagram at work.

146
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,375
It must be amazing.

147
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,125
Sure... come on over.

148
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,541
Nice, huh...? I can
do this after only

149
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,041
five days of practicing.

150
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,791
Have you seen what
I've been doing?

151
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,375
It's all amazing.

152
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,375
Maybe I should at least
tell Uiharu about all this.

153
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,166
Knowing her, though, she'll
be mad at me for doing it.

154
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,333
-Akemi!
-Akemi...! What happened?

155
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,041
-Akemi!
-Akemi, wake up!

156
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,541
-Are you okay?
-Akemi!

157
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,833
Finally, you answered...

158
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,041
I've been worried
about you....

159
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,500
You seemed really
distant at school,

160
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,375
and I haven't been able
to get you on the phone.

161
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,583
all of a sudden.

162
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,083
-What?
-Akemi.

163
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,583
She just collapsed
all of a sudden.

164
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,291
I didn't know that
using the Level Upper

165
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,333
could make anything
like that happen....

166
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,208
She just fell down
out of nowhere.

167
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,375
It's like something
out of a bad dream.

168
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,750
I can't believe this...

169
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,416
I just-I had no idea.

170
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,416
Okay...

171
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,583
You need to calm down...

172
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,166
Go slow. Start
from the beginning.

173
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,166
Well, the thing is, I got
my hands on a Level Upper.

174
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,916
You said anyone found
in possession of one

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,750
would be in trouble...

176
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,125
But I couldn't bring
myself to get rid of it.

177
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,791
And then Akemi
and the others said

178
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,458
they really wanted one...

179
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,416
No... the truth is...

180
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,958
I... I was too afraid
to use it by myself.

181
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,583
Never mind.
Where are you now?

182
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,875
Do you think whatever this
is will happen to me, too?

183
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,208
And if it does,...
will I ever wake up?

184
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,875
Or will I be
unconscious forever?

185
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,291
I couldn't take it...

186
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,125
I was so tired of
not having any power.

187
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,041
And finally, it
didn't matter anymore

188
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,125
what lengths I had
to go to to get it.

189
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,291
Mama...

190
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,333
Huh...?
What did you just say?

191
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,916
Maybe Level Zeroes like me
are permanently defective.

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,333
No, don't talk like that.

193
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,625
I ignored the rules

194
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,208
and went looking for power
of my own, anyway...

195
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,125
Maybe I'm being
punished for that.

196
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,833
I got involved in
something dangerous...

197
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,541
and it hurt my friends...

198
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,375
I... I'm awful!

199
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,750
It'll be okay!

200
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,875
If you fall asleep,
I'll wake you up...

201
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,166
It's not gonna be forever,
I promise you!

202
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,333
You, and Akemi,

203
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,125
and everybody else
who's gotten sick.

204
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,666
We'll make you all
better in no time!

205
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,333
I know it!

206
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,708
So you just sit back and
leave everything to me,

207
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,250
understand?!

208
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,375
Saten, you just need
to hang in there,

209
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,291
and things will get better
before you know it!

210
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,208
Uiharu...

211
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,458
Being a Level Zero doesn't
make you defective.

212
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,791
Even without abilities,

213
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,250
you're so full of
life and energy,

214
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,375
it's a challenge to keep
up with you every day.

215
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,916
No amount of power could
make you more incredible

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,416
than you already
are to me.

217
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,541
You're my best
friend in the world!

218
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,541
So stop it...

219
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,333
just stop it!

220
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,583
Stop saying such
horrible things...

221
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,416
because they aren't true!

222
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,958
You're asking me to put all
my trust in you on this one?

223
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,666
No, I'm not saying
it's just me!

224
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,166
There's Misaka and Shirai

225
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,291
and lots of other people
working on it, too.

226
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,083
Yes...

227
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,916
of course there are...

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,583
Thanks a lot...

229
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,000
You're a good friend.

230
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,875
Sorry for causing
so much trouble.

231
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,875
I'll let you handle
it from here, okay?

232
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,000
Saten... no!

233
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,416
So, Saten used
the Level Upper?

234
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,750
Yes.

235
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,708
Uiharu wanted to make
sure Saten was here

236
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,208
and as stable as they could
make her right now.

237
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,458
Then she took the data
and hurried to Dr. Kiyama.

238
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,458
Oh.

239
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,500
Do you have a second?

240
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,833
What did you want to
talk about out here?

241
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,666
Saten had a good
luck charm...

242
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,291
Do you remember it?

243
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,208
Oh, wait... the thing she always
had dangling from her bag?

244
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,500
That's the one...

245
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,083
She said she got it as a
gift from her mother...

246
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,541
right before she
came to Academy City.

247
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,541
She told you that?
It sounds very personal.

248
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,791
Yeah...

249
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,250
I get the feeling there
were a lot of things

250
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,416
she wanted to tell me.

251
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,708
But I just froze up.

252
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,375
They can call me a
Level 5 all they want...

253
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,708
but I'm not any good when
it comes to this stuff.

254
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,041
Aw, that's not true.

255
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,041
It's the kind of
person I am...

256
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,541
someone places a
hurdle in front of me,

257
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,291
and I can't rest until
I've jumped over it.

258
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,250
That's how I felt about
reaching Level 5...

259
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,083
It never seemed like
anything particularly great.

260
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,125
But...

261
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,000
I guess there are some
hurdles that you can't cross.

262
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,291
I'd never thought how
difficult it must be

263
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,958
to be in that situation.

264
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,166
"Does your Level really
matter that much?"...

265
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,083
Come on.

266
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,166
How inconsiderate can I be?

267
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,583
Will you please let me help
you out with this one case...?

268
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,750
I feel like it's
something I owe to Saten.

269
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,041
I guess I can do that.

270
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,375
That's awesome...

271
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,583
Thanks Kuroko.

272
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,333
I... I should be thanking you.

273
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,000
Do you have a moment?

274
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,541
A real Gekota!

275
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,125
Calm down, Sissy,
he's just a normal doctor.

276
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,583
What we're looking at

277
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,625
are the brainwave patterns
of the Level Upper victims.

278
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,916
Brainwaves vary from
person to person,

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,958
so the waveforms should
all be quite different

280
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,458
across the board.

281
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,125
However, I noticed something
surprising in this case.

282
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,708
Each of the
Level Upper victims

283
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,583
has a common
brainwave pattern.

284
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,458
What does that
mean, exactly?

285
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,666
It could point to an
outside influence...

286
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,333
Perhaps somebody else
is forcing their brains

287
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,958
into these
particular patterns,

288
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,291
and thus controlling the
function of their bodies.

289
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,125
So someone controlling
the Level Upper

290
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,000
is tampering with their brains
to put them all into a coma?

291
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,125
Why would somebody
want to do that?

292
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,958
I'm just a humble doctor
reporting my findings to you...

293
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,083
Determining the
motive is your job.

294
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,125
I see.

295
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,458
That girl we met
the other day.

296
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,666
I feel so responsible.

297
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,666
You can't blame yourself
for what happened to her...

298
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,416
Sit here and calm down...

299
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,083
I'm going to put
on some coffee.

300
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,541
This is no time to
be calm and relaxed.

301
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,250
The results of the analysis
haven't come through yet...

302
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,750
If she wakes up to find
you've collapsed...

303
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,750
that's not going to do

304
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,416
either one of you
any good will it?

305
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,833
It will be okay...

306
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,166
I'm sure everything is going
to work out in the end.

307
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,916
If this really does match

308
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,708
a specific person's
brainwave pattern...

309
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,458
All we have to do
is have Uiharu

310
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,583
run a search through
the databank, and...

311
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,250
Right, Uiharu isn't
here to do that.

312
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,791
Yeah, that's a problem.

313
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,125
Goodness, what's all the moaning
and groaning about in here?

314
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,625
Well, since you asked...

315
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,500
If that's the case,

316
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,708
the first step we'll need to
take is to access the databank

317
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,041
to get the information.

318
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,875
What if the data
isn't in the databank?

319
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,541
It will be
there somewhere.

320
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,208
Data is stored on any adult
who has been to the hospital

321
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,291
or taken a vocational
aptitude test,

322
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,583
along with all
the students

323
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,708
undergoing ability
development.

324
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,583
Okay... but this is all
still really confusing...

325
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,041
How could using
the Level Upper

326
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,500
reprogram somebody's
brain waves?

327
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,083
And moreover,
how would doing that

328
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,833
raise somebody's
ability level...?

329
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,750
So much of this
seems impossible.

330
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,708
It's like a computer.

331
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,041
Not even one of those

332
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,916
will increase in performance
that dramatically

333
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,250
just because you're running
different software on it.

334
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,541
Unless it's connected
to a network, anyway.

335
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,666
So a computer's
performance increases

336
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,125
when connected to a network?

337
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,541
Well, individually,
there's no major improvement...

338
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,708
But you can connect a lot
of different computers

339
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,166
in a parallel network...

340
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,416
then their computing
power does increase.

341
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,041
That's it...
Whoever's behind this

342
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,083
is constructing a
network of brains!

343
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,791
And they're doing it
with the Level Upper!

344
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,500
Well, it is a possibility.

345
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,833
But how does it work?

346
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,916
What's connecting all of
their brainwaves together?

347
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,958
If I had to make
a guess, then...

348
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,625
maybe an AIM
diffusion field...?

349
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,625
All espers emit a
force around themselves

350
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,625
without even
being aware of it.

351
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,333
If those were to
be connected....

352
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,541
But you said espers do
that unconsciously...

353
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,791
Besides, if we're comparing
humans to computers,

354
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,458
wouldn't we all run different
operating systems...?

355
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,875
How would it be possible
to link up together, then?

356
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,041
Computers in a network

357
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,208
also have different
operating systems;

358
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,625
they even use
different languages.

359
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,083
But networks can be created

360
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,041
by putting certain
protocols in place.

361
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,083
So in this case,
you're saying

362
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,166
that a particular
person's brainwave pattern

363
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,250
is serving as the protocol
for the whole network?

364
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,208
It's all speculation
at this point.

365
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,750
Okay... and if a
number of brains

366
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,458
were connected like that...

367
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,125
they would be able to do an
enormous amount of computing.

368
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,000
So one person might have
only a weak ability,

369
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,375
but by plugging
into the network,

370
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,541
the throughput of that
ability would increase,

371
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,916
making the person
significantly stronger.

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,125
Add to that the collective
thought patterns of espers

373
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,708
who have the same talent,

374
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,125
and you'd be able to manage that
ability much more efficiently.

375
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,416
It would be an incredible
boost in power.

376
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,375
So my hypothesis is that

377
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,875
all the brain activity of the
coma patients is being used

378
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,208
to power this network.

379
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,250
Hey, here we go!

380
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,958
The brain patterns' agreement
rate is ninety--nine percent.

381
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,750
This, too...

382
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,208
and this.

383
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,250
These are all papers
on synesthesia...

384
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,208
but why?

385
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,916
How impolite of you.

386
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,041
Looking at somebody's
research papers

387
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,375
without asking permission.

388
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,750
Can... can it be true?

389
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,291
Registrant name...

390
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,166
Harumi Kiyama?!

391
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,833
Uiharu!

392
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,583
What do you mean?
What about her?

393
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,208
She said earlier that she was on
her way to Dr. iyama's office!

394
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,666
What's she doing?

395
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,583
Uiharu!

396
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,916
I'm not getting
through to her.

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,333
Contact Antiskill

398
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,208
and have them take the
doctor into custody...

399
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,208
but be sure to warn them.

400
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,458
There might be a hostage.

401
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,625
Right!

402
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,958
You know something...?

403
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,166
I've been wondering about
this for a while now...

404
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,791
What's with all the
flowers in your hair...?

405
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,625
Does it have something to do
with your ability as an esper?

406
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,791
I don't see why I should
answer your questions.

407
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,250
But I have some for you...

408
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,375
I want you to tell me
about the Level Upper.

409
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,375
Why have you done
all of this...?

410
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,541
What will happen to the
people who are sick?

411
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,333
You are full of questions...

412
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,625
And yet you refuse to
answer the single question

413
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,250
I asked of you.

414
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,166
What do you get out of randomly
increasing someone's ability...?

415
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,000
You raise their hopes, and
then you put them in a coma?

416
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,166
Saten's a kind,
loving person.

417
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,208
She doesn't deserve
something like this.

418
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,250
I have no interest at all
in other people's abilities.

419
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,416
My ultimate objective is
much greater than that.

420
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,166
I'm coming along, too.

421
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,375
Although I don't normally like
getting civilians involved...

422
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,041
having someone with
your power around

423
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,500
could be beneficial.

424
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,041
Hold on, Sissy!

425
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,583
Don't forget Uiharu's
a member of Judgment.

426
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,583
She can handle herself
if she needs to.

427
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,416
Probably...
if she's lucky...

428
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,375
It isn't that unlikely...

429
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,083
Besides, Antiskill is
getting involved, too.

430
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,958
I doubt a scrawny
scientist like her

431
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,916
will be able to do
much against them.

432
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,125
The lives of thousands of
comatose espers are in her hands

433
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,000
as we speak.

434
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,208
Plus...

435
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,083
I've just got a bad
feeling about this-

436
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,625
You're right...
This could be bad...

437
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,125
Which is why a
Judgment officer...

438
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,166
Are you in good enough
shape to go into action?

439
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,458
You mean you knew...

440
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,833
about all my injuries?

441
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,250
Yeah, of course I did.

442
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,750
You may be strong, but I'm
still the older one here.

443
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,083
It's been a rough week...

444
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,000
so you can turn
to your Sissy.

445
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,750
Thank you, Sissy.

446
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,291
[Music]

447
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,500
I had a great time today...

448
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,083
And I think I'll finish by
undressing for the preview...

449
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,875
-Next time...
-Keep your clothes on!

450
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,958
And get ready, 'cause
I'm taking you down!
