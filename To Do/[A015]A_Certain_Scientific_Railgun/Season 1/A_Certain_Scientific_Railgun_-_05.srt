1
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,583
Give me a break!

2
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,333
I can't believe they
still have me training

3
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,083
with the green recruits
after all this time.

4
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,041
I didn't join Judgment
to spend time

5
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,791
doing pushups with
a bunch of newbies.

6
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,916
Come on, Uiharu!

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,208
Can't you even do one?

8
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,875
Here, would you
like a sip of this?

9
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,041
Wow. An entire year, really?

10
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,958
You've already been in
Judgment that long, Shirai?

11
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,791
So, I guess they
must be letting you

12
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,125
go out in the
field by now, huh?

13
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,541
Yeah of course they are.

14
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,250
How exciting.

15
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,375
That's kind of out of the
question for someone like me.

16
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,208
I'm not very athletic.

17
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,166
I've always been
a straggler.

18
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,291
And I was hoping that if they
accepted me into Judgment,

19
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,583
it might help me
to change that.

20
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,583
But what use is it if I can't
even keep up with the training?

21
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,875
You must always follow
your convictions

22
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:53,208
and act in the way you
feel is right at all times.

23
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,625
That's one of Judgment's
primary philosophies, you know.

24
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:57,833
If you can just
nurture the strength

25
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,708
to stick to your
convictions,

26
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,833
the results you seek are
sure to follow in time.

27
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,500
Let's see here.

28
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,916
Where else do we need to
get these cameras installed?

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,958
Right over there.

30
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,041
And there, too, I think.

31
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,708
It's almost shameful.

32
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,833
I really can't believe
they've put off the installation

33
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,416
of additional surveillance
cameras until now.

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,708
The Judgment officers at
this school must be pretty lax

35
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,541
to have let this happen.

36
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,083
Well, at least they're
taking care of it now

37
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,791
before any real
harm is done.

38
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,708
That's not the point.

39
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,041
It's the principle of the...

40
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,208
Come on. Let's go!

41
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,083
Right!

42
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,458
Seriously?

43
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,500
Right out in
broad daylight.

44
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:17,625
At school and in front of
Judgment officers, too.

45
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,000
You can't go
out there alone.

46
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,083
You have wait a minute
for backup to arrive.

47
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,750
Don't worry,
I can handle this.

48
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,083
You stay here.
I'll be fine.

49
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,666
All right, that's as
far as you're getting.

50
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,833
Huh?

51
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,708
Judgment knows
your crimes now.

52
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,125
I am arresting you.

53
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,958
The charges are destruction
of property and burglary.

54
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,083
Please be careful.

55
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,458
There may be more
than one burglar.

56
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,875
Please, that doesn't
really matter.

57
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,625
Car thieves are
small potatoes.

58
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,916
They're easy to deal with.

59
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,208
Now, if you would please
come along quietly.

60
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,750
Cooperate and no harm will...

61
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,625
Shirai!

62
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,250
Hey! Let's get going!

63
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,833
Right.

64
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,333
Wait! Please, stop running!

65
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,500
Move it!

66
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,250
Uiharu?

67
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,666
Uiharu!

68
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,500
Uiharu! Shake it off! Get up!

69
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,708
Oh, good!

70
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,500
I... I think I'm all right.

71
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,916
My goodness.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,416
I think that took a year
or two off of my life.

73
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,791
What about the burglars?

74
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,958
They'll be long
gone by now.

75
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,750
My word.

76
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,250
You know, Uiharu,
today's further proof

77
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,625
you're not ready to be a
full--fledged officer.

78
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,041
You should stay back.

79
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,125
Just sit at the
branch office

80
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,708
backing me up like
you always have.

81
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,750
But that's not fair.

82
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,958
I did try to help you.

83
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,583
I told you that you
should be careful

84
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,958
because there might be more
than one of them in there,

85
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,083
but you totally ignored me and
now they've gotten away!

86
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,500
You're always doing this,
again and again.

87
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,750
You're reckless, and you try
to do too much on your own,

88
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,916
even though it keeps
getting you into trouble.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,916
You ... you're exaggerating
things a little, aren't you?

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,125
When have I ever rushed
into a situation on my ow...

91
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,916
The better question would be,
when have you not?

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,250
You're always doing it!

93
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,791
Like just now.
You could've waited for...

94
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,583
I suppose you think it would've
been better to stand there

95
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,000
and let the
criminals get away?

96
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,125
Would you stop and think
about what you've done?

97
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,833
If you keep this
kind of behavior up,

98
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,000
what will become of
the promise we made?

99
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,916
The promise?

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,250
You mean you
don't remember?

101
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,291
Well, uh...

102
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,750
Oh, never mind!

103
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,041
If you don't even care,

104
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,083
I won't bother
helping you anymore!

105
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,166
Just do whatever you want!

106
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,291
How're you doing?

107
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,666
Is Uiharu around today?

108
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,083
Oh, you're here again?

109
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,208
You can't just stop by to
hang out whenever you want.

110
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,458
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,708
But I have a legitimate
reason this time.

112
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,000
See?

113
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,041
A bona fide school
assignment.

114
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,500
I was going to see if
Uiharu would help me.

115
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,041
Ah, geez.

116
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,541
Fine, she's
right over there.

117
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,333
See?

118
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,791
So, you know, it might
not be the best time.

119
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,375
She's in a pretty
foul mood right now.

120
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,666
U--i--ha--ru!

121
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,625
We've got clovers
today, huh?

122
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,916
Where's the lucky
four--leaf clover?

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,416
There must be one here.

124
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,250
Hey! I'm lifting
it up even higher!

125
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,000
My, what a nice view!

126
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,166
Something's wrong.

127
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,125
What is the
matter with her?

128
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,916
She got into it
with Shirai a bit,

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,041
so she's a little off.

130
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,541
Wow, that sounds like
quite an argument.

131
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,916
It was pretty ugly.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,583
We should probably
just leave her alone

133
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,666
for a little while.

134
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,583
I can see how that might
make her think about

135
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,166
leaving her post at
Judgment altogether.

136
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,916
Whoa, hold on there.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,708
Let's not give her
any crazy ideas.

138
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,666
Together with Antiskill,
Judgment is in charge

139
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,833
of maintaining peace and
safety within Academy City.

140
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,458
It's not the kind of job
you can just toss aside.

141
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,333
Oh. I see.

142
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,333
But is giving her time
alone really all we can do?

143
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,333
There's more between those
two than meets the eye.

144
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,833
So, I think they'll
work it out somehow.

145
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,291
Huh?

146
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,041
What do you mean there's
more between them?

147
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,125
Well, you see...

148
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,250
I can't take it anymore!

149
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,375
If this fight is really
bothering you so much,

150
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,375
why don't you go ahead and
make up with her already?

151
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,166
Don't want to.

152
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,333
You need to do something.

153
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,625
Talk to her.

154
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,166
Otherwise, she's going
to stay angry with you,

155
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,041
and your partnership
will fall apart.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,833
Maybe that's just
how it has to be.

157
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,250
If it ends over
something like this,

158
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,541
it wasn't much of a
partnership to begin with.

159
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,000
There's that bravado
she mentioned.

160
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,916
It isn't just bravado!

161
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,416
You and Uiharu have such
different personalities.

162
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,625
How did you become partners
in the first place?

163
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,250
Well, it's a long story.

164
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,541
It wasn't something I
had planned on happening.

165
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,833
She was so slow she could
barely keep up in training.

166
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,250
But then one day ...

167
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,166
Okay. That concludes
our patrol for the day.

168
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,583
If you have any questions,
now's the time to ask.

169
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,875
Actually, there is
something I'd like to ask.

170
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,083
What is it?

171
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,250
I've been a
member of Judgment

172
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,250
for an entire year
at this point.

173
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,291
I'm always stuck doing
research and odd jobs,

174
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,750
or I accompany you
when you go on patrol.

175
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,750
It's not what I expected.

176
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,625
You're upset because
you're an honor student,

177
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,500
but you're not being treated
as a full- -fledged officer,

178
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,416
right?

179
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,958
I don't know if that's how
I would put it, exactly.

180
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,125
I thought that
maybe it was

181
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,125
because I'm still in
elementary school.

182
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,625
Your age isn't the only
cause for concern.

183
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,041
There's another issue.

184
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,208
You've shown a lot
of potential so far,

185
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,541
but you have a habit of trying
to solve things by yourself,

186
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,083
and that's dangerous.

187
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,041
You have to learn to rely more
on other people around you,

188
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,958
or you could get
yourself into trouble.

189
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,416
Come on, don't
make that face.

190
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,708
Tell you what, why don't I buy
you something sweet as a reward

191
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,208
for all your hard work?

192
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,291
Just hang on one sec while
I withdraw some cash.

193
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,041
I knew it. She does still
think of me as a child.

194
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,000
Hello, Shirai!

195
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,083
What a coincidence!

196
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,166
Uiharu? What are you doing
in the Seventh District?

197
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,791
Middle school
is almost here,

198
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,083
so I came to look at
the different schools

199
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,750
and dormitories.

200
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,875
Middle school, huh?

201
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,625
You have an older friend?

202
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,833
Why would you say that?
I'm looking for my own sake.

203
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,541
It's such a big decision.

204
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,875
Oh, uh--huh.

205
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,458
She's the same
age as I am?

206
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,791
I always thought she was
two or three years younger.

207
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,458
So, Shirai, have you decided

208
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,250
which school you're
going to go to yet?

209
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,958
Oh. Yeah, I have.

210
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,958
It's this place called
Tokiwadai Middle School.

211
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,708
What a great opportunity!

212
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,291
Tokiwadai is one of the
five most prestigious schools

213
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,916
in Academy City!

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I bet life at a place like
that is so refined and elegant!

215
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,791
It may not actually
be as glamorous

216
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,958
as you're making
it out to be.

217
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,208
I bet everybody
is pretentious.

218
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,041
All the students who are
enrolled at the school

219
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,208
are at least a
Level 3 Esper.

220
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,500
Basically, it's going to be
full of a whole bunch of girls,

221
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,916
all of whom are convinced that
they are somebody special.

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,666
From what I hear,
there's even a Level 5 there

223
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,375
who they've given the
absurd nickname "Railgun."

224
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,041
I can only imagine how arrogant
and condescending a girl

225
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,916
like that is going to be.

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,833
That's a pretty severe
assessment of someone

227
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,333
you've never met before.

228
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,541
So, if you came to
look at schools,

229
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,375
what are you doing in here?

230
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,791
Is something the matter?

231
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,750
Excuse me.

232
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,083
Is something going on?

233
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,083
That man over there.

234
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,750
He's focusing on
where the workers are

235
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,041
and what they're doing.

236
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,166
I don't like looking
at people's things

237
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,250
without their permission,

238
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,916
but I'll have to
make an exception.

239
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't see anything
too out of place.

240
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,291
He has a gun in
his right pocket.

241
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,583
He's robbing the place?

242
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,333
I'll go inform
the employees.

243
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,291
I want you ready to
lead the customers out

244
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,000
if it looks like something
bad is happening.

245
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,875
You're not going
to arrest him?

246
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,750
Of course not.
That would be out of bounds.

247
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,166
That's a job
for Antiskill.

248
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,625
They're the ones
who catch criminals.

249
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,666
How can she be so
complacent about it?

250
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,750
That's correct.

251
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,875
Contact Ant...

252
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,125
No one try
anything funny.

253
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,208
Everybody keep quiet.

254
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,291
There's no need to
make a big scene.

255
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,041
Damn, he's already
making a move.

256
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,458
This is what I've
been training for.

257
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,041
What do you know?

258
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,500
That wasn't so
difficult after all.

259
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,000
Pathetic.

260
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,666
Letting a little girl like
that get the best of you.

261
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,166
You're useless.

262
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,708
Uiharu!

263
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,500
What's that? So this other girl
is a friend of yours, huh?

264
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,625
That's very convenient.

265
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,250
Easy, now. Stay
right where you are.

266
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,333
You're with Judgment,
aren't you?

267
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,208
A Judgment officer could
never abandon a hostage, right?

268
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,708
Especially if she happened
to be a friend as well.

269
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,333
Could this get any worse?

270
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,291
If so, they should
come out now.

271
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,916
What are they thinking?

272
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,541
Sounding the alarm
is going to spook them.

273
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,541
Do they care more about the
money than people's lives?

274
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,500
Security signal received.

275
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,250
Security signal received.

276
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,333
Proceeding to
eliminate intruder.

277
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,291
Please drop your weapon
and lie down on the floor.

278
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,541
Gimme a break.

279
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,875
There's something
in his right pocket.

280
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,208
Warning issued.

281
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,416
Initiating action.

282
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,458
Close one!

283
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,791
Konori, no!

284
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,625
Don't charge someone.

285
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,958
Not unless you
can be certain

286
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,333
of what they have
up their sleeve.

287
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,333
Remember that, okay?

288
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,500
-Konori!
-Hey!

289
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,833
So, there were more
of you hiding here.

290
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,083
Are you okay?

291
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,750
He was an idiot.

292
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,083
Did you think you could
take me so easily?

293
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,958
Please, stop it!

294
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,666
-Shirai!
-I'll show you.

295
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,083
Are you all right?
Please don't hurt her anymore!

296
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,625
Shirai!

297
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,458
There's no one to
blame but myself.

298
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,750
I made a reckless decision
without thinking things through.

299
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,708
It's my fault.

300
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,916
I put them both in danger.

301
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,916
What a mess I've made.

302
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,166
Konori was right about me.

303
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,958
This is more trouble
than I'd bargained for.

304
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,791
Please!

305
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,250
But still.

306
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,791
Just give up already.

307
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,791
No.

308
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,333
You don't have to do this!

309
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,000
Please!

310
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,916
If nothing else,
I can get you out safely.

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,958
What now?
What are you up to, kid?

312
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,250
I'm free?

313
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,416
You're a teleporter?

314
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,458
Are you still
in there, Shirai?

315
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,708
Why didn't you come?

316
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,166
Why did you just send me?

317
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,958
I'll teach you
to mess with me.

318
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,250
Shirai, get out of there!

319
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,708
Come on, hurry!

320
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,291
Unfortunately,
that's not an option.

321
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,708
My power is not
yet at the point

322
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,166
where I can transport myself.

323
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,583
And besides,

324
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,958
I intend to see this case
through to its conclusion.

325
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,208
Say something!

326
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,750
Somebody! Help!

327
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,875
This is an emergency!

328
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,208
There's a burglar inside,

329
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,125
and he's attacking
a Judgment officer!

330
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,041
He's got her trapped!

331
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,541
Is anybody listening?

332
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,458
I need help!

333
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,291
I bet I can guess what's going
through your head right now.

334
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,875
You're thinking the alarm
sounded a while ago.

335
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,750
So, surely Antiskill will
be here any minute now.

336
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:10,916
And, if you can
just stall me

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,541
and prevent me
from taking hostages,

338
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,666
everything will be okay.

339
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,916
I'm right, aren't I?

340
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,208
You're wrong, though.

341
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,791
Because I don't
plan to wait around

342
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,583
to be taken into custody.

343
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,208
The power of "Equal Speed."

344
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,916
Anything I throw will
keep moving forward

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
until I release my power.

346
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,875
It doesn't matter
what's in the way.

347
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,958
All obstacles
will be destroyed.

348
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,083
Too bad for you.

349
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,625
Didn't see that
one coming, huh?

350
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,791
Time's running out.

351
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,458
Hey!

352
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,333
Use your power to get
the money out of there.

353
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,666
If you cooperate with me,
I'll let everyone else go.

354
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,208
Yeah. I know.

355
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,041
You and I should
become partners.

356
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,500
Working together
we'd be unstoppable.

357
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,333
So, what do you say?

358
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,083
This situation just
keeps getting worse.

359
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,166
I acted impulsively.

360
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,791
And I've dragged
everyone down with me.

361
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,875
But... It's not over yet.

362
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,458
My answer is ...

363
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,541
No!

364
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,125
I'll never work
with someone like you!

365
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,791
Be your partner? Please!

366
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,375
You're a petty thief

367
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,583
who couldn't even manage to
rob a small place like this

368
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,875
without making a mess
of the whole thing.

369
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,541
So, I think I'll pass.

370
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,291
Anybody! Please! Help me!

371
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,708
I've already made my decision.

372
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,125
I believe in the
power of justice.

373
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,833
And I'll never
stray from that!

374
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,625
Well, then.

375
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,208
That's too bad.

376
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,375
His ability may be strong,
but it isn't especially fast.

377
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,291
As long as my
legs cooperate.

378
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,916
That means I'll
have to kill you.

379
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,416
Aw, sorry.

380
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,208
Did you think I could
only throw one at a time?

381
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,083
Hey!

382
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,583
Your power versus my power.

383
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,916
A steel ball versus
teleportation.

384
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,750
Shall we see which
is the quicker one?

385
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,166
Damnit.

386
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,958
You know, that was
pretty amazing!

387
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,875
It takes real skill to handle
something like that by yourself.

388
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,333
Yeah.

389
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,916
What exactly
happened there?

390
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
If it's okay, I'd like
to make you a promise.

391
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,041
I will always follow
my convictions

392
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,541
and act in the way
I feel is right,

393
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,041
just like you told me.

394
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,208
And, like you, I believe
in the power of justice,

395
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,083
and I won't stray from it.

396
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,625
No matter what happens
I'll never lose heart.

397
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,958
Someday, I know I'll be as good
a Judgment officer as you are.

398
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,958
Thanks, Uiharu.

399
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,041
I'd like to make a
promise to you, too.

400
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,000
Until today, I thought I could
take care of everything

401
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,500
without anybody's help,

402
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,291
but I was wrong about that.

403
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,291
I propose a partnership
between the two of us.

404
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,041
Let's become full-fledged
Judgment officers together.

405
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,375
Deal!

406
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,416
Aww.

407
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,958
What a sweet story.

408
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,791
Hmm? Is something wrong?

409
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,041
Oh. No, it's nothing.

410
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,000
That must have
been the promise

411
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,666
she was talking about.

412
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,791
But how am I going to
apologize to her now?

413
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,458
Hello? Shirai, here.

414
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,666
Huh?

415
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,750
Uiharu did what?

416
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,375
Well, she figured out
where those car thieves

417
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,333
you lost track
of earlier were.

418
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,291
As soon as she did,
she rushed right out of here.

419
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,333
After what happened,
she's determined to find them.

420
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,291
So, Shirai, what are you
going to do about it?

421
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,416
I am going to...

422
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,291
Follow your convictions

423
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,083
and act in the way
you believe is right,

424
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,625
never straying
from justice.

425
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,708
That it?

426
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,125
Go on.

427
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,000
You can still
work together.

428
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,250
Even if you do
butt heads sometimes.

429
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,166
Hey! What are you
dawdling around for?

430
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,791
If you keep moving
at this rate,

431
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,791
the two of us will never become
full--fledged officers together!

432
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,000
Always in such a hurry.

433
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,083
A happy ending.

434
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,666
I'm not too surprised.

435
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,083
Fights don't tend
to last very long

436
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,791
when you're that young.

437
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,541
Sh... Shirai,

438
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,666
don't you think we should
slow down a little?

439
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,958
Forget it.
I'm going on ahead.

440
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,666
Hey! No teleporting!

441
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,041
That's not fair!

442
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,250
It's about time for
Judgment to step up.

443
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,750
You think this
job is easy?

444
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:05,625
Let's see you try it.

445
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:06,791
There's an idea!

446
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,958
Next episode,
"Sissy's First Time"!

447
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,666
You don't have to
say it like that!
