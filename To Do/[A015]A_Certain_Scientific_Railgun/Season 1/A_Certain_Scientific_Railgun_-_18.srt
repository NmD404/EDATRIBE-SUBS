1
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,583
Kuroko!

2
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,708
Use of your abilities inside
the dorms is prohibited...

3
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,041
How many times do
I have to say it?

4
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,000
Right... Misaka?

5
00:00:54,958 --> 00:01:00,916
[Music]

6
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,416
Give me a break.

7
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,708
What an old bat...

8
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,291
All she ever talks
about is rules!

9
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,208
Well, that is kind of her
job description, you know.

10
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,500
Is there nothing we can do

11
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,125
to make her chill out
a little bit...?

12
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,916
I was just teasing
you yesterday;

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,291
it's not like I was
doing any harm to anyone.

14
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,958
Why am I always the
one she chooses

15
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,708
to vent her frustration on...?

16
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,083
I'm telling you,
she's a bitter old maid.

17
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,208
I wouldn't let her
hear you say that.

18
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,500
That's the truth of the
situation, though, isn't it?

19
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,541
She's the head resident
of a girls' dormitory,

20
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,291
a job that offers zero
contact with men.

21
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,125
No wonder she's
still single.

22
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,375
But she shouldn't
take it out on us;

23
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,666
it isn't our fault
she's heartless and alone.

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,875
That was just her,
wasn't it?

25
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,041
Yeah, but what
is she up to?

26
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,083
There's something
off here.

27
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,041
She's dressed like
a normal person.

28
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,208
Now that you mention it,

29
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,875
I've noticed that
she goes out somewhere

30
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,541
whenever she has time off.

31
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,250
To meet a man! Huh?

32
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,875
Come on. This is the
perfect opportunity!

33
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,375
Kuroko, where
are you going?

34
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,458
So... do you have
a plan, here?

35
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, yes. We're
going to follow her

36
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,791
and get leverage
to use against her.

37
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:32,750
Leverage? Like what?

38
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,500
It must be a blind date...

39
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,916
I can't imagine that somebody
would willingly go out

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,708
with such an inhuman harpy
after actually meeting her.

41
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,250
Although, whoever set her up
must be quite a gambler.

42
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,833
What are the chances
of this matchmaking

43
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,041
foray turning out well...?

44
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,125
Oh! Perhaps her
date lost a bet

45
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,750
and has to go out
with her as payment.

46
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,041
I think that's taking
it a little far.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,708
Odd place for a blind date.

48
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,708
I see now.

49
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,250
Her mystery man
must be Italian...

50
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,166
An Italian man
named Marco!

51
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,375
Okay, now you're
just making stuff up.

52
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,666
School District 13...

53
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,875
All this way...?

54
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,250
What on earth is
she doing here?

55
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,125
How long do you plan
to follow her, anyway?

56
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,041
Until I get to see her darling
Marco with my own eyes.

57
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,125
Yes, of course. "Marco."

58
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,041
Ah... hey look, Auntie's here!

59
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,000
Best be careful who you're
calling Auntie, young man...

60
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,458
If you want some
of this yummy food,

61
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,250
you should call
me Big Sister.

62
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,500
Wow!... It's pizza!

63
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,875
Now, now, there's
no need to push.

64
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,708
I brought enough
for everybody.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,375
No way.

66
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,625
This is Asunaro Park
Children's Orphanage...

67
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,458
It says here that this is
a Child Error facility.

68
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,291
Huh...? That's the
term they use for kids

69
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,000
who are left in Academy
City without any family.

70
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,541
As always, thanks
so much for coming.

71
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,208
It's nothing.

72
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,750
The little ones always look
forward to seeing you...

73
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,250
"When's Big Sister coming?"
they ask.

74
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,375
I'm sure I enjoy it
more than they do.

75
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,416
The help you give
us is priceless...

76
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,291
I can't tell you
how much we appreciate

77
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,375
having you volunteer here.

78
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,583
I hope you'll continue
coming for a long time.

79
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, I will.

80
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,958
Big Sister, you're gonna
eat with us, aren't you?

81
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,333
Just try to stop me.

82
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,625
I've never seen her
act like this before...

83
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,708
She's so... happy.

84
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,875
This is unusual indeed...

85
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,333
I never would have guessed

86
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,541
that this is what she'd
choose to do on her days off.

87
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:55,875
To think I had no idea

88
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:56,958
that the noble Head Resident

89
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,625
had such a tender
heart buried

90
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,541
underneath her
rough exterior.

91
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,875
"Noble"?

92
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,333
Compared to her, we
are selfish children...

93
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,166
I am ashamed to think of all
the horrible things we said...

94
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,666
calling her a
bitter old harpy...!

95
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,916
Idiots...!

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,083
Uh, you're the one
who said all that...

97
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,125
Hold on...

98
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,625
It's not fair for them to
make us do community service

99
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,000
because we had
lousy test scores.

100
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,833
This could be a valuable
life experience.

101
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,416
Besides, it's fun playing
with the children

102
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,375
and seeing their
smiling faces.

103
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,750
Yeah... I guess you're
right about that.

104
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,416
Oh... excuse me...
do you have a moment?

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,291
I want to introduce
you to our director...

106
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,250
Saten, Uiharu, this is
Miss Kazuko Shigenomori.

107
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,666
It's a pleasure
to meet you...

108
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,541
Are these two girls
students of yours, Daigo?

109
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,041
They are.

110
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,208
I want to thank you in advance
for all your help today.

111
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,041
Not at all.
We're happy to be here.

112
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,500
By the way...

113
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,583
are those two over there
friends of yours by any chance?

114
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,875
Huh?

115
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,166
What a coincidence running
into you guys here, huh?

116
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,750
Are you guys
volunteering, too?

117
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,250
Oh... um... y'see...

118
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,083
Hey... isn't that the head
resident of your dorm in there?

119
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,333
Did the three of
you come together?

120
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,708
Oh, no... Certain
circumstances led us here,

121
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,166
but I won't go into it.

122
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,583
Okay... nicely done, everybody.

123
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,583
Hello!

124
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,166
It's nice to
see you again.

125
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,750
Oh... it's nice
to see you, too.

126
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,291
A couple of my students
came to volunteer today...

127
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,416
They're new, so they might
make some mistakes...

128
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,666
Please feel free to
tell them if they do.

129
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,083
Oh, no, no...

130
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,125
I'm sure that none
of your charges

131
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,666
could do anything wrong...

132
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,958
Don't be silly...

133
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,833
Plus... I don't
have much experience

134
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,541
when it comes to
scolding students.

135
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:39,166
Wow... I had no idea your head
resident volunteered here.

136
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,000
Maybe Mr. Daigo
asked her to help out.

137
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,666
The man she's talking to
in there is called Mr. Daigo?

138
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,500
Yes, that's his name.
He's our homeroom teacher.

139
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,500
Finally, her mystery man
has been revealed to us.

140
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,541
Huh?... What are
you talking about?

141
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,666
Isn't it obvious?

142
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,916
Our head resident has fallen

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,375
head over heels
in love with him!

144
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,208
-Wha-?
-In love?!

145
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,291
I have a mission.

146
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,833
I will see to it that her
love does not go unrequited...

147
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,083
I will not fail her!

148
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,250
I don't know about
this, Kuroko...

149
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,833
I do...! I think it
could be a lot of fun.

150
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,500
I'll help, too.
She deserves a happy ending!

151
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,958
You guys're getting on
board with this idea, too...?

152
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,458
I hope you realize it's not
going to be a simple task.

153
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,750
Fortunately, Shirai
has a devious talent

154
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,541
for creating
romantic situations.

155
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,541
How about I give you
a smack on the head?

156
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,583
It's no good to ask
after you've done it...

157
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,250
That wasn't nice.

158
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,208
Okay, that's enough
standing around...

159
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,875
Let's hold a
strategy meeting!

160
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,375
Oh, noble head resident...

161
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,750
We welcome you home.

162
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,166
What do you think
you're doing?

163
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,250
You do not care for
a moist towel...?

164
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,666
Then please allow me to
take your bag for you.

165
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,500
Oh, look at that...

166
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,750
I see you've chosen a higher
end beverage than normal...

167
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,583
Did something
special happen today?

168
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,916
What kind of joke
are you playing?

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,916
I don't mind
punishing you again.

170
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,083
No joke, ma'am.

171
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,416
Helping you in your time
of need is my only desire.

172
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,791
If you have anything you
need to get off your chest,

173
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:08,708
you can confide in me.

174
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,041
Anything at all!

175
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,083
Discuss my personal
life with you...?

176
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,791
No way, not a chance...

177
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,875
Don't be absurd.

178
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,375
Forgive me...

179
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,416
I only want to be of service
to my noble role model.

180
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,583
I can tell when you're up
to something, Shirai...

181
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,791
What is it?

182
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,875
I'm not up to
anything at all...

183
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,083
I'm sorry I've given
you reason to think so.

184
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,000
It's just that today
I had the chance

185
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,541
to see you playing with
the poor young orphans,

186
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,708
and I gained so much
respect for you!

187
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,416
How do you know
about that?

188
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,958
That's not even
the half of it.

189
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,666
I know about
Mr. aigo, too...

190
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,458
Right...? We know it all?

191
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,750
Oh, uh... well...
Uh--huh!

192
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,875
All right, you! What exactly
do you know about Daigo?

193
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,666
Won't you let us help you
this once, Head Resident?

194
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,458
Help how?

195
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,041
We could play the part of
Cupid for you and Mr. Daigo.

196
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,250
Wouldn't that be great?

197
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,333
No...! Never...! Why
would I need Cupid?

198
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,125
Besides... I'm not even
interested in Mr. Daigo.

199
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,041
Ma'am surely you do
not want to deny

200
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,166
the true desires
of your heart.

201
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,666
That would be tragic!

202
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,083
You may as well admit that

203
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,625
what you want from Mr. Daigo
goes beyond friendship...

204
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,875
It's no use
saying otherwise.

205
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,583
I can see right
through you.

206
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,500
Why you little, what gives
you the right to say that?

207
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,791
It's been twenty--nine
long years.

208
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,875
Hasn't the time come to
know the joys of love?

209
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,375
Isn't that what
you deserve?

210
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,250
Just... go away!

211
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,083
Are you sure you want to
spend the rest of your life

212
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,791
as an old maid?

213
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,083
K--Kuroko...!

214
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,791
If you let this
chance pass you by,

215
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,166
you may not get
another one...

216
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,833
I have my own experience
with unrequited love.

217
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,166
Please, Head Resident,

218
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,250
allow me to help you make
your dreams come true!

219
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,291
Er... don't you think
that's enough...?

220
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,416
Eh?

221
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,333
You mean it?

222
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,166
This isn't just some trick?

223
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,666
You really wanna help me?

224
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,708
Yes. I really do.

225
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,250
Eh...

226
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,375
Huh?!

227
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,250
These lovely girls
have volunteered

228
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,375
to play with you
this afternoon...

229
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,875
Let's give them a nice,
warm welcome, okay?

230
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,416
It's nice to
meet all of you.

231
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,833
What a great turnout...

232
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,083
I'm so glad your students
could come along ...

233
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,375
You must be really
proud of them

234
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,958
for volunteering like this.

235
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,583
Oh... yes...
I'm very proud.

236
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,541
-Mr. Daigo!
-Yes?

237
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,250
What is it?

238
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,208
So... what's this brilliant plan
for me, Shirai...? What now?

239
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,375
You just relax and
take it easy for now...

240
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,833
Your love life is in very
capable hands, I can assure you.

241
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,541
All right. We're going to
put the plan into action

242
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,250
immediately.

243
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,625
So there is a plan?

244
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,083
Oh... well...

245
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,583
Mission accomplished! I've got
her all settled in the kitchen.

246
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,333
Good. Excellent work, Saten...

247
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,083
With that done,
phase one of the plan

248
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,458
is officially complete.

249
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,500
On to phase two.

250
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,916
In which we get
the head resident

251
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,875
and Mr. Daigo alone together.

252
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,250
Having them participate in
a collaborative activity

253
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,416
is a surefire way to
bring them closer...

254
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,875
Our plan needs a name...

255
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,125
"Operation Fruits of Love"
is now in effect.

256
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,625
"Fruits of Love?"
Are you sure...?

257
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,250
Doesn't that make
it sound improper?

258
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,666
Well... the fruits of love
are children, aren't they?

259
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,000
Hey, Big Sisters...

260
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,416
Come play with us!

261
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,958
Well, you heard
the girl, Sissy...

262
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,250
Why don't you go
and play with them?

263
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,208
You remember us discussing
this part, don't you?

264
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh... well, okay then.

265
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,583
All right, everyone!
Let's go!

266
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,583
Oh, Shirai... what am I...

267
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,500
Sorry to keep you waiting.

268
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,291
Daigo, hi...
Why are you-?

269
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,458
Well...

270
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,000
I wanted to come help
you with the cake.

271
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,625
I have to admit,
I'm really impressed

272
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,416
that you're going to
make a cake from scratch

273
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
for the birthday party...

274
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,583
Homemade is always better.

275
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,375
Well... uh...

276
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,708
Well, how about I get
started on the icing?

277
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,833
I know I don't look it,

278
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,375
but I am fairly
good at cooking...

279
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,958
or I try.

280
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,583
There's something about
baking a cake from scratch

281
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,875
that feels so homey.

282
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,041
Oh... Yeah...

283
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,541
It may sound silly...

284
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,166
but this is the kind
of thing I love.

285
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,041
It's so fulfilling...

286
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,375
the act of
creating something.

287
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,250
Sorry, I realize
I'm blabbering...

288
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,708
but this is so nice.

289
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,125
It's just-I'm hoping to
get married someday...

290
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,000
and standing in the kitchen
like this with my wife

291
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,833
is a favorite
daydream of mine.

292
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,041
I wonder how they're
getting along so far.

293
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,541
Come to think of it,
we just assumed

294
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,958
that things were going to
go well between them...

295
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,250
What do we do if it
doesn't go as we planned?

296
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,250
Well, you see...

297
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,708
Hey, that sounded like the
head resident, didn't it?

298
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,208
-What in the world?
-Calm down.

299
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,791
There's nothing
to worry about...

300
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,083
Naturally, I made sure to
prepare contingency plans

301
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,916
should anything
unexpected happen.

302
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,750
Ah...! What's going on?

303
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,583
It looks like
something exploded!

304
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,750
What is all this?

305
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,625
Uh. I can explain.

306
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,000
It was all my fault...

307
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,208
I was trying to open a bag
of flour, and it just...

308
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,458
All of this from
opening a bag of flour?

309
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,958
Hey... It'll be okay...

310
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,333
We can start over...

311
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,708
No problem... Right?

312
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,875
Right... thank you, Daigo.

313
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,833
Unfortunately, there
isn't enough time for that

314
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,041
before the
birthday party.

315
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,833
So... maybe you
could run out

316
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,583
and get us a
replacement cake.

317
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh... I guess you're
right... Okay...

318
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,458
If you could wait one sec.

319
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,375
Our noble head resident
here knows of a cake shop

320
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,666
that should
work perfectly!

321
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,541
Sh... Shirai!

322
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,250
It's fine.
Don't be nervous...

323
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,625
These two will go along
with you for moral support.

324
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:18,916
You're coming?

325
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,500
Yes...!
We're at your service.

326
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,625
Hurry! Run away!

327
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,666
This is crazy.
What am I doing here?

328
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,291
Hah...! I caught you!

329
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,666
Yeah... I was no
match for you...

330
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,083
and I guess that means
it's my turn to be "it."

331
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,500
Now... run...

332
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,250
Run as fast as you can,
or I'm gonna catch you!

333
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,000
I would do anything
to save them...

334
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,250
anything in the
entire world!

335
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,833
The whole city can
hate and revile me.

336
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,166
I don't care!

337
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,041
I'm not going to let
anything stop me now!

338
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,416
Child Errors...

339
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,958
Huh...

340
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,250
-"Happy Birthday Meg &amp; Kei"
-Happy Birthday, Meg and Kei!!

341
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,500
Hip, hip, hooray!

342
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,875
It ended up being
a big ordeal.

343
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,583
First we went
the wrong way...

344
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,416
Then we got
chased by a dog...

345
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,000
And nearly fell
into the river.

346
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,000
How could that happen?

347
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,583
You were just
buying a cake.

348
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,958
Well... who cares?

349
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,791
It turned out all
right in the end.

350
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:11,708
All right, everybody...

351
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,875
Time to dig in!

352
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,166
Yeah!

353
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,416
This is nice, huh...?

354
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,958
Everybody's having
such a good time.

355
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,333
I'm sorry...

356
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,041
I... I wish I could've
been more helpful today.

357
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,125
Oh, hey...

358
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,625
I haven't seen you
without your glasses...

359
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,666
It looks nice.

360
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,458
Oh... I mean... you look
good with them on, too...

361
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,458
but you also look pretty
when you take them off.

362
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,458
Look at that! They're being all
lovey--dovey with each other!

363
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,333
Hah! Lovey--dovey!

364
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,125
Hey...! You shouldn't be
teasing grownups like that!

365
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,416
That's just silly...

366
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,208
For one thing, I'm certain
that your Big Sister

367
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,875
would have no interest
in me whatsoever.

368
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,583
I've got an idea.

369
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,583
How about you describe your
ideal woman for us, Mr. Daigo?

370
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,833
Huh... well, let me see....

371
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,958
Someone I could respect,
I guess.

372
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,333
Someone you can
respect, huh?

373
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,041
And what would
that require?

374
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,583
Well... she would really
have to be somebody

375
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,083
who puts the needs of others
before her own, you know?

376
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,083
Earthquake?!

377
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,041
Right... okay...
everybody stay...

378
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,291
Listen up! Everybody take
cover under the table.

379
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,708
Good... now stay
there and keep qui...

380
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,333
Be careful!

381
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,166
Has it stopped?

382
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,333
We've had a lot
of these lately...

383
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,750
Thankfully it was small...

384
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,041
We'll be fine.

385
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,041
Oh, no!

386
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,375
Miss! Are you two okay?

387
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,208
Young man...! Didn't I tell
everyone to get under the table?

388
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,041
Yes... I'm sorry, Big Sister.

389
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,500
It'll be okay. Are you
sure you're not hurt?

390
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,875
Oh, wow.

391
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,416
You were fantastic.

392
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,958
You have my respect.

393
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,416
No, really...
it was nothing.

394
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,916
You were fantastic.

395
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,333
You have my respect.

396
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,833
-No, really...
-And so...

397
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,583
I would like to marry you.

398
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,958
Say yes, and we'll
cook together forever.

399
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,166
Yes.

400
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,583
I am so sorry.

401
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,333
I know I was
out past curfew.

402
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,208
These things happen...

403
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,625
Just try to be more
punctual next time.

404
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,125
That's unbelievable...

405
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,666
I've never seen
the head resident

406
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,708
overlook a curfew
infraction before.

407
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,166
It was inevitable,
I suppose.

408
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,666
Love changes a person.

409
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,791
Yes, hello...?

410
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,791
Oh...! Daigo!

411
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,458
Huh...? There's something
you wanna ask me...?

412
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,000
And you're sure
you want me...?

413
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,041
It has to be me, you say...?

414
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,625
All right.
I'll be there.

415
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,625
What does he need to
ask her so urgently?

416
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,166
Isn't it obvious?

417
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,666
After today, there's only
one thing it could possibly be.

418
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,000
Huh?

419
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,500
He's going to propose?

420
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,583
I can't believe it's
really happening!

421
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,375
This is so exciting,
I can hardly stand it!

422
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,625
Why would he choose a
family restaurant like this?

423
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,000
It is pretty pathetic...

424
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,958
I'm guessing he's never
had a girlfriend before

425
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,250
so he doesn't have
any idea what to do.

426
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,458
Obviously when a man
proposes to a woman,

427
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,833
it should be at sunset

428
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,458
in a fancy, romantic
restaurant on the beach!

429
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,541
No... a rooftop restaurant
with a view of the city...

430
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,500
Right... Misaka?

431
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,750
Yes, and then...

432
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,916
after she's accepted
his gallant proposal...

433
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,250
they climb on
top of a mountain

434
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,375
and watch a fireworks display!

435
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,625
-That's going a little far.
-That's going a little far.

436
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,791
What?

437
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,208
So, anyway...

438
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,041
You said there's something
you wanted to ask me...

439
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,208
Yes... I guess I should just
come right out and say it.

440
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,666
Yes?

441
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,250
I was wondering...

442
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,208
How would you feel
about marrying somebody

443
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,166
who is younger than you?

444
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,541
M--Marrying...

445
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,791
Someone... younger?

446
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,458
Yes... for instance...

447
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,708
someone like me.

448
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,458
I've got you now!

449
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,875
Well... I, uh...

450
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't really
think age matters...

451
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,583
not as long as you
respect the person.

452
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,000
I knew it...!

453
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,458
I figured you
would say that,

454
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,458
but I just wanted
to make sure.

455
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,916
Sorry for calling
you out of the blue

456
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,625
to ask you
something like that.

457
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,916
No...

458
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,916
Congratulations!
Way to go!

459
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,333
You mean you
were watching?

460
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,666
Head Resident, I knew
you had it in you...!

461
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,333
Now, you'll need
to pick a venue...

462
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,750
and meet his parents...

463
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,916
And then honeymoon!

464
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,875
Shirai... I would appreciate it

465
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,291
if you would give me a
hard pinch on the cheek.

466
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,708
Huh?

467
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:56,916
If this is all
just a dream,

468
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,083
I'd like to wake up now.

469
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,708
Well if you insist.

470
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,500
Okay. That's enough, Shirai.

471
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,291
Before you go...

472
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,041
There's one additional
favor I need to ask of you.

473
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,875
I, uh...

474
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,000
I want to give him
a proper answer.

475
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,708
Around and around and
around and around......

476
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,250
Hello, Daigo...

477
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,583
Around and around and
around and around......

478
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:39,083
Do you... have a sec?

479
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,416
I can't put my
finger on it,

480
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,291
but there's something
different about you today.

481
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,291
Um... about our conversation
the other night...

482
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,875
Yes. I really
appreciated that...

483
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,541
I finally have
the courage I need,

484
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,166
and it's all thanks to you.

485
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,750
Oh! What's this?

486
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,916
I'm going to propose
to my girlfriend.

487
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,083
Girlfriend?

488
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,291
That's right.

489
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,708
And your girlfriend is...

490
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,541
Yes...

491
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,083
I was nervous.

492
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,541
But then you said
age doesn't matter

493
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,166
as long as you
respect the person...

494
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,541
and I knew you were right.

495
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,916
I can't tell you how
grateful I am to you.

496
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,166
Sure.

497
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,375
It's no problem...

498
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,833
I'm glad I could help.

499
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,125
Congratulations...

500
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,958
I wish you all the best.

501
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,458
All right.

502
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,916
Aww... I was sure it was
going to work out for her.

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,875
That's a shame.

504
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,833
I bet she'll find
someone else before long.

505
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,125
Of course she will.

506
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,041
She's a great person.

507
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,625
Okay, everyone...!

508
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,583
What are we going
to play today?

509
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:20,291
[Music]

510
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,333
No fair! I couldn't've been
more than a second late!

511
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,458
It doesn't matter if
it's an hour, a second,

512
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,541
or a tenth of a second.

513
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,750
Whatever the case,
you broke curfew.

514
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,541
I hope you're prepared to
answer for that, Shirai.

515
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,291
Kuroko!

516
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,000
Kuroko!!

517
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,458
Now, Head Resident,

518
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,041
I know you've suffered
a major disappointment,

519
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,375
but don't let it
get you down...

520
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,791
Just think of
those children

521
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,041
looking up at you with their
sweet, angelic faces...

522
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,250
Mow them down!
