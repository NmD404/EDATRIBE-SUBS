1
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,291
The attacks began
a week ago

2
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,125
and they have been
escalating ever since.

3
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,250
It is a series of
Graviton attacks,

4
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,625
with each
successive incident

5
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,458
the force and scale
have both increased.

6
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,291
We cannot find any pattern

7
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,375
in the times and locations
of the attacks,

8
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,458
and after examining the
psychometry of articles

9
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,500
left behind,

10
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,500
we still do not
have any leads.

11
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,875
We are working
with anti-skill

12
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,625
to prevent anymore
casualties.

13
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,708
We have increased security

14
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,250
that we must do
everything we can

15
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,750
to get this case solved.

16
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:22,916
[Music]

17
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,625
Are you sure you're
feeling okay?

18
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,041
You were up late
again last night

19
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,000
investigating those
serial attacks.

20
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,166
It's the only thing
I can think to do.

21
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,166
The search is still
turning up nothing.

22
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,500
For now, I'm just
checking to make sure

23
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,583
we haven't overlooked
anything.

24
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,041
Well, it's great you're so
committed to your work and all,

25
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,750
but you shouldn't
push yourself so hard.

26
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,541
Aw! Thank you, Sissy!

27
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,291
It warms my heart to know
you're so concerned about me.

28
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,625
I think what would
really help is

29
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,458
if we could sleep in the
same bed together tonight.

30
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,916
My fatigue would
evaporate immediately!

31
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,291
Aw, man!

32
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,083
Well, the least you can
do is wait for me, Sissy.

33
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,708
Really, must you
always be so coy?

34
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,083
AIM diffusion fields
are localized phenomena

35
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,000
that occur only
around Espers.

36
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,208
Of course,
AIM is an acronym.

37
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,458
It stands for
"An Involuntary Movement."

38
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,791
An AIM diffusion
field is a weak force

39
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,125
that Espers involuntarily
emit around themselves.

40
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,083
It can't be felt
with the five senses.

41
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,541
Without specialized
equipment,

42
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,583
it can't be
detected at all.

43
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,500
However, researchers into
applications in this field

44
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,958
have been making remarkable
progress recently.

45
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,958
Hey! What're you
poking me for?

46
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,583
You want to do some shopping at
Seventh Mist on the way home?

47
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,666
Yeah! Oh, I can't.

48
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,458
I still have work
to do for Judgment.

49
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,916
You can blow that off for
a bit, though, can't you?

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,583
Just say we were out
patrolling or something.

51
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,666
That won't work.

52
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,041
I really would love
to go with you,

53
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,208
but solving this case just
matters more right now.

54
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,625
Oh. Okay.

55
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,583
Hey.

56
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,166
We need cash.

57
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,541
You gonna lend us some more?

58
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,208
What? I can't.

59
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,041
I mean, I would,
but you haven't paid back

60
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,708
what you already
borrowed from me.

61
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,791
Huh?

62
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,916
We told you we'd pay
you back, didn't we?

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,500
Once we've got the dough.

64
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,666
Don't you remember?

65
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,833
You're giving us loans,

66
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,583
indefinitely and
interest, free.

67
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,041
That was the deal we had.

68
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,125
Is this seriously
all you've got?

69
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,291
Come on.

70
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,958
Let's get going before
Judgment shows up.

71
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,375
Nothin' to worry
about there.

72
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,833
They're too busy
with those bombings

73
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,375
to have time for
anything else.

74
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,333
Damnit.

75
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,041
He's right.
They're useless.

76
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,041
Judgment?
Don't make me laugh.

77
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,333
This wouldn't be
happening to me

78
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,875
if they'd do their job.

79
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,000
But just wait.

80
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,916
Aw, geez!

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,666
I wish we had just a
little more to go on.

82
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,291
Yeah, tell me about it.

83
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,500
So far all we know

84
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,041
is the suspect is a
Level 4 Esper or higher.

85
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,375
We really need
more information.

86
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,041
Hm.

87
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,833
And the databank
isn't coming up

88
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,875
with a match to the ability.

89
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,291
Maybe it's somebody

90
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,708
who's had a very sudden,
dramatic increase in power.

91
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,958
No. No way.

92
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,875
Over such a short
period of time?

93
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,166
That would be impossible.

94
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,541
Just wishful thinking.

95
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,875
You're right. Something like
that could never happen.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,291
Let's keep at it.

97
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,875
We'll go over the fragments
left behind again.

98
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,208
Yeah, good idea!

99
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,041
Saten!

100
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,083
Kuroko's so stressed.

101
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,541
It must be just
as hard on Uiharu.

102
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,625
She's working so much!

103
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,166
I asked if she wanted to
go shopping with me today.

104
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,541
Of course she said, "No."

105
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,333
Yeah. They don't
really have a choice

106
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,375
until this mad
bomber is captured.

107
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,958
It all makes me feel ...

108
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,208
I don't know.

109
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,375
I feel so insignificant
right now.

110
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,875
Oh, how should I put it?

111
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,375
Uiharu and Kuroko are doing

112
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,541
so much work for
this Judgment case

113
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,000
and obviously, you're
in a league of your own.

114
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,375
And then there's me,
and I'm just ...

115
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,916
Oh, sorry! Really!

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,166
I'm not trying to
throw a pity party!

117
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,458
I just mean if I had
an ability, too,

118
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,750
it would really change
my life, you know?

119
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,291
Aw. If only I had a
Level Upper or something,

120
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,750
then maybe I could be
a Level 5 someday, too.

121
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,666
What's a Level Upper?

122
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,583
It's one of those urban
legends I mentioned before.

123
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,166
Apparently, it's a device

124
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,708
that will automatically upgrade
your ability level for you.

125
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,625
When we found out the
"Undresstress" was real,

126
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,916
I started thinking maybe
it could be real, too.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,833
But that's ridiculous,
isn't it?

128
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,208
Say... Let's all go together!

129
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,958
You want me to go shopping
with you, Sissy? Really?

130
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,875
You and Uiharu
are both off.

131
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,083
I told Saten I thought it
would be fun for all of us

132
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,208
to make a day of it.

133
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,625
Oh. You said that, did you?

134
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,333
Well, I appreciate
the offer,

135
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,291
but I don't think
I'll be able to go.

136
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,375
I still need to do a little
bit more investigating.

137
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,833
Oh. Okay, then.

138
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,958
Well, good luck.

139
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,666
I'm going to sleep.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,041
A new world order
is on its way.

141
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,708
And this time,
I'll be on top.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,333
It's a shame Shirai
couldn't make it today.

143
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,083
Oh, she's not
coming at all?

144
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,291
Apparently, she
still has to work.

145
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,458
Judgment has never done
anything to help me.

146
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,333
Who needs them?

147
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,416
Over here! Come on!

148
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,875
So, are you looking
for anything specific?

149
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,708
No, but I haven't really
thought about it that much.

150
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,208
U--i--ha--ru!

151
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,666
Come look over here!

152
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,208
Uh, at what exactly?

153
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,791
See?

154
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,791
These are great,
aren't they?

155
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,458
No! Never, never, never!

156
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,666
On me?

157
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,375
I couldn't get away
with those, could I?

158
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,041
Think of how stylish
and mature they'd look.

159
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,000
You could show
them off proudly

160
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,458
whenever I flip
up your skirt.

161
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,250
I don't want to show off.

162
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,833
I don't want my
skirt flipped up!

163
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,375
Aw, that's too bad.

164
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,083
Oh, hey!

165
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,708
What are you in the
market for today?

166
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,458
Huh? Well, let's see.

167
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,250
Maybe some new pajamas?

168
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,166
In that case,
let's head this way.

169
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,250
They sure do have a
lot of stuff here.

170
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,416
But I haven't seen
anything I like so far.

171
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,708
Over here!
These are adorable!

172
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,541
Whoa. Hey, Uiharu.

173
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,541
You've gotta check
these pj's out.

174
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,958
When was the last
time you saw anybody

175
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,291
wearing something like that?

176
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,000
I had something that
looked very similar back

177
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,625
when I was in
elementary school.

178
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,791
But that was a while ago.

179
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,750
Well, yeah, of course.

180
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,875
Now that we're
in middle school,

181
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,416
we can't wear this
type of thing.

182
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,541
Obviously.

183
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,125
Well, I think I'm gonna
look at swimsuits.

184
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,291
Yeah, all right.

185
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,750
I'm pretty sure they
were back this way.

186
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,083
Cool.

187
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,291
Who cares, anyway?

188
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,041
They're just
pajamas, right?

189
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,708
It's not like anyone
else will see them.

190
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,375
How about this one?
Isn't it pretty?

191
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,958
All right,
now's my chance.

192
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,166
Nobody will notice if
I take a quick look.

193
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,833
Yoink!

194
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,791
Uh, what are you
doing, Zapper?

195
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,333
I'm shopping with friends.

196
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,583
What are you doing here?

197
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,458
What, am I not
allowed to be here?

198
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,875
Big Brother!

199
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,333
You're with the nice
lady from Tokiwadai!

200
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh! The girl with the bag.

201
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,500
I didn't realize you
had a younger sister.

202
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,875
Yeah, well, I don't.

203
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,166
This little girl
just asked me

204
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,291
to help her find
a clothing store.

205
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,333
Seems she's nicknamed
me, Big Brother.

206
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,458
Now we're here!

207
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,041
Big Brother picked
out a perfect store!

208
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,708
I'm gonna dress up
real pretty and fancy!

209
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,083
And I'll look just like
the grown--ups on TV!

210
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,625
You will, will you?

211
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, I think you already
look pretty snazzy this way.

212
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,791
Unlike a certain somebody
I happen to know.

213
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,458
You want a piece of me?

214
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,083
I'm perfectly happy to settle
what we started the other day.

215
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,333
Huh? You're still worked up?

216
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:20,083
Is that the only thing
you ever think about?

217
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,708
Here? Really?

218
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,875
You actually want
to start a fight

219
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,333
in front of all
these people?

220
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,833
Hey, hey!

221
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,208
I wanna look there!

222
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,708
Oh? Well, let's go.

223
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,750
Bye--bye, nice lady!

224
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,958
See you!

225
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,208
What's up?

226
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,583
Is something wrong, Misaka?

227
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,958
No. It's nothing.

228
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,583
That guy always makes
me lose my temper.

229
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,125
Why does he do that to me?

230
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,708
Gekota!

231
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,458
Never mind.
It's not.

232
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,708
It doesn't look much
like him at all.

233
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,083
I'm starting to wonder.

234
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,791
Could we have two
different suspects?

235
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,291
Both with the same M.O.?

236
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,875
Don't be silly.

237
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,750
I'm grasping at straws.

238
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,291
I just can't see any connection
between all of the attacks.

239
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,875
If we don't figure
this out soon,

240
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,041
we'll have another victim on
our hands-maybe more than one.

241
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,416
If only we had at
least one solid lead.

242
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,458
Nine of our colleagues
have been hurt already.

243
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,250
Nine?

244
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,666
What are you thinking?

245
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,958
That seems like an awful lot,
don't you think?

246
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,125
Maybe we're the targets!

247
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,750
Accelerated gravitons
have been detected!

248
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,458
Uiharu. That's your
phone, isn't it?

249
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,875
Oh. Yeah, it is.

250
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,333
-Yes, this is Ui...
-Uiharu!

251
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,125
Update on the
graviton attacks.

252
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,500
The surveillance
satellite has picked up

253
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,458
an explosive acceleration
of gravitons.

254
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,166
Where is it happening?

255
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,125
Antiskill officers in the area
are responding immediately,

256
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,958
but we need you to get
back here at once!

257
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,000
Wait, Kuroko.
Where is the attack?

258
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,541
A clothing store
called Seventh Mist

259
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,083
in the Seventh School District.

260
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,833
Seventh Mist clothing store?

261
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,875
That's perfect, then.

262
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,666
That's where
I am right now.

263
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,583
I'll start the
emergency evacuation!

264
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,750
Uiharu!

265
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,333
Hello? Are you there?

266
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,041
What does she
think she's doing?

267
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,833
What's going on?
What did she say?

268
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,208
Please listen
and don't panic.

269
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,625
We know where the
attacker's next target is.

270
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,833
We're standing in it.

271
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,041
Wha... What did you say?

272
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,541
Here's the plan.

273
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,125
I want you to start helping
with the evacuation, Misaka.

274
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,166
Yeah. Sure thing.

275
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,416
And Saten-you get
to safety, okay?

276
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,416
You'll be careful,
too, won't you?

277
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,541
He's got his next
target, all right.

278
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,458
Attention all customers.

279
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,833
We are experiencing

280
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,541
an electrical malfunction
inside the store.

281
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,750
We sincerely apologize for any
inconvenience this might cause,

282
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,666
but we must immediately
suspend business for the day.

283
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,500
Please follow the
clerks' instructions

284
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,416
to the nearest exit.

285
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,375
Again, we sincerely apologize
for any inconvenience,

286
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,750
but we must immediately
suspend business.

287
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,916
Zapper!

288
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,666
Have you seen
that little girl?

289
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,875
Huh? I thought
she was with you!

290
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,916
I can't find her anywhere.

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,583
She could still be
inside the store.

292
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,208
What is she doing?

293
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,166
Hey!

294
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,083
Uiharu!

295
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,208
Everyone has been evacuated.

296
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,500
Listen to me. You need to
get out of there right now!

297
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,625
The only human casualties
in the past attacks

298
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,208
were Judgment members.

299
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,708
The suspect's actual target
is any Judgment officer

300
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,875
who's in the area!

301
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,541
And that means
that this time

302
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,500
the target is
going to be you!

303
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,833
Hey there, lady!

304
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,250
Is that...?

305
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,416
A strange man wearing
glasses asked me to come over

306
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,708
and give this to
you as a present.

307
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,000
Here!

308
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,083
Get down right now!

309
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,416
That thing is a bomb!

310
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,333
I'll railgun
it out of here!

311
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,666
Uh--oh!

312
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,375
-What was that?
-An explosion!

313
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,583
It must be one of
those serial bombings!

314
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,875
It looked like there
were still people inside!

315
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,625
I think I saw a
girl from Judgment.

316
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,333
Everybody! Stand back!

317
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,750
Get back now, people!

318
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,083
Clear the area!

319
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Awesome!

320
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,083
That was perfect! Perfect!

321
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,041
I'm controlling stronger
and stronger power every time!

322
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,083
I'm getting close.

323
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,041
A few more attacks
and I should be ready.

324
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,333
I'll take on Judgment
and those punks at school

325
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,291
along with 'em.

326
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,041
I'll blow every last one.

327
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,708
What the...
What happened?

328
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,833
Hi!

329
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,791
I assume you know
what this is about.

330
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,958
I'm right, aren't I?

331
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,208
-Mister Mad Bomber?
-No.

332
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,666
I have no idea what you're
talking about, really.

333
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,666
Well, there is a lot
of property damage.

334
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,166
I'll give you that.

335
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,541
But too bad for you.

336
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,750
There wasn't a
single causality.

337
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,500
Nobody suffered even
so much as a scratch.

338
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,500
No! That's impossible!

339
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,708
I was using the
maximum power.

340
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,083
Well, I mean, it looked like
a huge explosion from outside.

341
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,625
So, I seriously doubt
anybody still in the store

342
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,083
could have survived it.

343
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,125
It's Railgun.

344
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,500
The great Ace
of Tokiwadai.

345
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,791
Just my luck.

346
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,708
It's always like this.

347
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,750
No matter what I do.

348
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,791
People are always
beating me down,

349
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,000
but I'm gonna stop it.

350
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,125
I'll kill you all.

351
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,166
It's people like you
who are the problem.

352
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,291
And Judgment
is the same way!

353
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,875
And anyone who has power!

354
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,875
All you ever do is abuse it!

355
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,583
Power? Power, you say?

356
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,458
I'll show ya power.

357
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,500
Ahh!

358
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,833
You fool.

359
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,000
That punch was the
least that you deserved.

360
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,000
You use other people's
power as an excuse

361
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,708
for your own weakness.

362
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,708
There's almost nothing
more pathetic than that.

363
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,958
Don't you realize
even the great Railgun,

364
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,875
Ace of Tokiwadai,
started out at Level 1.

365
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,750
She didn't become a
Level 5 because of some fluke.

366
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,625
She worked hard for it
every step of the way.

367
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:46,416
You know, even if she was a
Level 1 instead of a Level 5,

368
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,833
I have a feeling

369
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,583
she still would have been
able to get the best of you.

370
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,791
There you are!

371
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,375
Oh! I was so
worried about you!

372
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,166
I know. I'm sorry.

373
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,291
But thanks to Misaka,
here we are.

374
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,291
All in one piece! See?

375
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,500
The lady from Tokiwadai
saved us just in time!

376
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,166
Yeah!

377
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,500
-She was pretty amazing, huh?
-Yeah!

378
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,041
There's something
strange about it, though.

379
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,083
The place where
they were standing

380
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,625
is the only spot
left unharmed.

381
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,541
I don't know how Sissy's
ability could have this effect.

382
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,291
Hey! There she is!

383
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,833
I have to admit,

384
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,083
you really outdid yourself
this time, Sissy!

385
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,375
Thank you so much
for everything!

386
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,541
Huh?

387
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,791
Oh. Yeah.

388
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,458
I know! Let me be your
personal slave for a day.

389
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,916
I'll do anything
you want me to!

390
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,875
I could wash your
back for you

391
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,666
or give you a nice massage.

392
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,041
What is your
bidding, Sissy?

393
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,125
I'll pass.

394
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,791
That sounds more
like what you want.

395
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,916
Thanks anyway.

396
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,791
Aw, come on!

397
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,166
Just a short massage, then!

398
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,500
Please!

399
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:21,291
[Music]

400
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,916
I don't deserve the credit.

401
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,250
My railgun wouldn't have
made it in time back there.

402
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,833
It wasn't me who saved
Uiharu and that little girl.

403
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,750
It was him.

404
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,666
An ambush?

405
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,916
-You angry?
-Huh?

406
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,541
Everybody seems to think

407
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:26,833
I'm the one who saved those guys
from the graviton explosion.

408
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:29,000
If you come forward,
you'll be a hero.

409
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,583
Huh? What are you
talking about?

410
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,333
Everybody got out
of it all right.

411
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,458
I don't really
see a problem.

412
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,958
Do you?

413
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,083
So what difference does
it make who saved them?

414
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,666
Stop acting so cool!

415
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,750
Why does he always
have to play the hero?

416
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,125
And why does he only
do it in front of me?

417
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:01,333
It's driving me crazy!

418
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,583
It's always the same thing.

419
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,916
That guy really
ticks me off!

420
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,750
You should calm down, Sissy.
You're turning red.

421
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,333
--Next time...
--I'm not turning red!

422
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:08,416
Ooh, bright red!

423
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,458
Your face is
burning my eyes!
