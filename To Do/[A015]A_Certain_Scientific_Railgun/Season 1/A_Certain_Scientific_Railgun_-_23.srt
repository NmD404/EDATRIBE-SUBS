1
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,250
Hello there, Haru'ue.

2
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,541
Your friends are here.

3
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,625
You said my
friends were here.

4
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,041
You mean Uiharu
and the others?

5
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,416
Well, why don't
we just see?

6
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,333
It's... Banri?

7
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,166
Yes! It is you!

8
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,666
Incredible!

9
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,708
You're here.
I can't believe it!

10
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,166
I need to tell Uiharu
about this right away!

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
[Music]

12
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,541
So, the ten child subjects
who've been missing

13
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,500
are now securely installed
at MAR's laboratory?

14
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,833
Yes.

15
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,291
They've been
found, finally.

16
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,875
Isn't that great, Uiharu?

17
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,458
Oh... yeah.

18
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,166
And the woman responsible
for the Level Upper incident

19
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,458
is behind this
situation as well.

20
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,083
She said that she didn't care
if the city was destroyed,

21
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,208
so long as the
children were saved?

22
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,458
That's a pretty extreme stance,
wouldn't you say?

23
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,041
So, Therestina said she's
going to find a way

24
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,458
to wake up Edasaki
and the others?

25
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,708
Huh?...

26
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,875
Oh... yeah.

27
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,291
Well, then, it sounds like
we've closed the case.

28
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,458
Excellent work!

29
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,583
Is something the matter?

30
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,750
It's nothing.

31
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,083
I know you all
too well, Sissy.

32
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,958
I'm guessing you're still
concerned about Kiyama,

33
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,958
aren't you?

34
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,000
You still aren't convinced
it was the right idea

35
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,958
to have the children
taken away from her, right?

36
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,458
I'm just not sure.

37
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,458
Well, be sure.

38
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,750
You made the right choice.

39
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,916
At least that's what
I believe, anyway.

40
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,958
Right.

41
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,166
Even so.

42
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,416
You crossed the line
this time, Sissy!

43
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,333
Going into a place
like that on your own?

44
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,583
If anything had
happened to you,

45
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,333
I don't know what
I would have done!

46
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,708
Hello, there.

47
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,125
You're spacing out now.

48
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,250
-Are you okay?
-Oh... yeah.

49
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,666
Come on. Aren't you anxious
to see how Haru'ue's doing?

50
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,875
Well.. yeah... I guess.

51
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,375
She'll be thrilled
to see you!

52
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,666
Let's get a move on!

53
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,375
Hey! All this pushing
isn't really necessary!

54
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,625
Now, now, you don't want
to keep her waiting, do you?

55
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,791
Let go!

56
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,416
Thrilled to see me, huh?

57
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,041
Well... maybe I should
bring her some things.

58
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,375
Let's see here....

59
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:53,333
Snacks, a game,
some reading material...

60
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,458
And what else?

61
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,000
Changes of clothing,
of course!

62
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,000
Waiting isn't good
enough anymore.

63
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,500
I need to start
looking for her.

64
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,125
Oh, Haru'ue.

65
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,958
I'm so proud of you.

66
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,958
I would do anything
to save them.

67
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,208
anything in the
entire world!

68
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,750
The whole city can
hate and revile me.

69
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,125
I don't care!

70
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,166
I'm not going to let
anything stop me now!

71
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,958
I'm sorry, Doctor.

72
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,083
-I don't have anything yet.
-I.. um...

73
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,375
Oh, it's you.

74
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,583
I have this friend, Haru'ue.

75
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,041
Maybe you've already
heard of her by now.

76
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,583
I actually haven't known
her for very long.

77
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,666
But she did tell me that she
and Banri Edasaki were friends

78
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,125
when they were little.

79
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,458
And.. you see...

80
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,416
Haru'ue is a telepath.

81
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,583
Every time one of the

82
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,958
poltergeisting
incidents occurred,

83
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,125
she could hear
Edasaki's voice.

84
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,333
Because of the
way she acted,

85
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,083
she was suspected of
being responsible.

86
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,250
Even so, she did
everything she could

87
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,125
to hear what Edasaki
was saying to her.

88
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,333
But now Edasaki isn't
missing anymore...

89
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,625
so...

90
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,125
Surely...

91
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,000
Surely, Haru'ue
must be happy

92
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,333
with the way things
have turned out.

93
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,666
So, what are you
trying to say?

94
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,916
I don't really know.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,125
I just thought I
should tell you.

96
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,958
I was so close to
finishing the vaccine

97
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,583
that would help them...

98
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,541
All I needed was to get my
hands on the First Sample.

99
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,208
I could have gotten their
runaway abilities under control.

100
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,333
I could have awakened
them at last.

101
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,708
I could have
brought them back!

102
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,416
Dr. Kiyama.

103
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,083
Let's collect all of your
data and take it to MAR.

104
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,916
It's bound to
be of some use.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,958
And then they'd let us in to
see Edasaki and the others.

106
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,916
I couldn't possibly.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,583
I know that's
what you want.

108
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,041
Let's go see them!

109
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,708
How can I say no to that?

110
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,041
Wow, you came all
the way out here

111
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,375
to bring me your research?

112
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,291
That's right.

113
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,583
Although... we
were also hoping

114
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,708
we could see how the children
were getting along here.

115
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,041
That's not possible.

116
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,458
We had to transfer
the children.

117
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,500
They will be going to a
facility that's better equipped.

118
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,250
Okay. Which facility?

119
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,083
I'm sorry, but I can't
disclose that information.

120
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,375
You'll just have
to take my word

121
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,833
that they'll be
well taken care of.

122
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,125
From here on out,

123
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,166
MAR will be responsible
for their treatment.

124
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,750
And another thing.

125
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,958
Haru'ue will be
staying with us.

126
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,875
What?... But, why?

127
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,750
Well, as you know,
she's spent a long time

128
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,291
waiting to see
her friend again.

129
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,541
She wants to
stay by her side.

130
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,666
Really?

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,250
Here, pick one.

132
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,125
Um... one, what?

133
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,500
Why, a color...

134
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,500
If the color you choose
is the one that comes out,

135
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,875
I'll let you see
Haru'ue and the others.

136
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,291
-Well... um...
-So indecisive!

137
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,333
Well, why don't
we choose yellow?

138
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,791
Here.

139
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,000
Aw, it's a brown one.

140
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,041
What a shame, huh?

141
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,208
This is no time to
be playing games!

142
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, I'm not playing
at anything.

143
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,833
Uh-oh... I'm so
sorry about that.

144
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't understand.

145
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,625
What's going on?

146
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,958
Oh, well. It's not as if the
data will be of any use anyway.

147
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,500
Director Kihara,
it's about time.

148
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,250
-One moment.
-Kihara...?

149
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,500
Oh, you mean you
didn't know that?

150
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,291
That's my middle
name, you see.

151
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,625
Kihara.

152
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,541
In full, Therestina
Kihara Lifeline.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,083
Why, you...!

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,833
Dr. Kiyama!
Are you okay?

155
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,875
Say something please!

156
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,916
We're terribly busy,
you understand.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,208
I hope you won't mind

158
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,125
if I ask you to
show yourselves out.

159
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,125
Here, have some tea.

160
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,625
You seem to be
in a good mood.

161
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, why wouldn't I be?

162
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,041
It's a relief
to have the

163
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,250
poltergeisting case
closed, finally.

164
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,541
We can go back to our
everyday lives again.

165
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,208
Uh-huh...

166
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,916
I know you guys have been a
little bit out of sorts lately,

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,875
but now everything can
get back to normal.

168
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,791
Isn't that right, Shirai?

169
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,500
I haven't behaved any
differently than usual.

170
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,458
Here.

171
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,000
I know! I'll give
Uiharu a call

172
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,166
and see when Haru'ue is
getting out of the hospital.

173
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,208
It is practically
the height of summer.

174
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,583
We should enjoy it.

175
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,375
You're right about that.

176
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,375
Hey, Uiharu.
It's Saten.

177
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,583
Where are you?

178
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,916
Saten...

179
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,500
What's wrong?

180
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,958
It's...

181
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:30,791
Oh...

182
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:31,916
Saten!

183
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,166
What's the matter?

184
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,291
Uiharu!

185
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,625
Come on, I can't understand
through all the sniffling.

186
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,875
What is it?

187
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,166
Finally, this is it.

188
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,750
I've finished gathering
all the material

189
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,375
about the poltergeisting.

190
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,500
Well, go ahead
and get rid of it.

191
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,541
I got a call from the
MAR laboratory just now.

192
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,000
They said they have all the
information they require.

193
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,791
Aw, man. This
took me so long!

194
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,750
Did they say
anything more?

195
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,625
Nope. They said
"it's over now"

196
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,958
and left it at that.

197
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,708
Doesn't that seem a
little... unusual?

198
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,791
Her name's Therestina Kihara?

199
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,708
Are you sure that's
what she said?

200
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,333
And Kiyama,
what about her?

201
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,666
I don't know.

202
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,875
She went... somewhere...

203
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,208
Take it easy.

204
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,583
It's gonna be okay.

205
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,583
Huh? Found her.

206
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,916
Yes, Therestina Kihara Lifeline.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,916
Gensei Kihara's
granddaughter.

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,041
-Oh, my.
-What, is there more?

209
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,958
She's included in the personnel
data from Kihara's lab,

210
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,708
from the time he
wrote his thesis.

211
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,958
What does that mean?

212
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,333
Therestina was Kihara's
research assistant?

213
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,458
That would make
sense, wouldn't it?

214
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,625
Wait a second!

215
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,041
What is it?

216
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,125
Therestina was the
first test subject

217
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,833
for the ability crystal.

218
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,041
How can that be?

219
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,833
Whoa, let me get
this straight.

220
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,250
You're telling me Kihara's
first human experiment

221
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,375
was on his own
granddaughter

222
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,958
and that Therestina
helped with his research?

223
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,625
The same woman who
has the Child Errors

224
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,000
under her protection?

225
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,375
What's going on?!

226
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,250
Don't ask me! I'm just
as confused as anybody.

227
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,875
What... What do we do?

228
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,583
I can't believe it!

229
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,458
How is this happening?

230
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,458
Please try to stop crying.

231
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,833
I can't!

232
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,958
Haru'ue... Edasaki...
all the other children.

233
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,083
It's okay.

234
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,416
What now?

235
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,833
I've failed them all!

236
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,541
What do I do?

237
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:39,416
Tell me, how much longer are
you going to sit there, crying?

238
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,583
You.. hit me...

239
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:45,375
Isn't there something more
useful you could be doing?

240
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,250
When are you going to
get a hold of yourself

241
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,208
and act like a
Judgment officer again?

242
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,125
Let me take over.

243
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,125
If you want.

244
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,125
Checking for
probable locations

245
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,958
where the children
would have been sent.

246
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,166
Where's Misaka?

247
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,000
Sissy...

248
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,625
Here.

249
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,166
You can use
this to dry off.

250
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,625
Great, thanks a lot!

251
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,500
I can't believe Kongo's been in
the hospital this entire time.

252
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,000
It seems excessive.

253
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,958
Is her condition
really that serious?

254
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,250
I'm kind of
worried about her.

255
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,833
Maybe we should go
pay her a visit, then.

256
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,375
Yeah, good idea.

257
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,041
Ignore her.
Keep moving.

258
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,583
I should tell you.

259
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,958
The children were aboard the
trucks that passed by just now.

260
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,708
Don't you want
to go after them?

261
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:14,958
You tricked us.

262
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,625
Are you angry?

263
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,875
I want to know what
you've got up your sleeve.

264
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,458
You make it sound
so sinister.

265
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,875
You are Gensei Kihara's
granddaughter.

266
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,750
You were also the
first test subject

267
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,541
for the ability crystal.

268
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,000
Used as a lab rat by
your own flesh and blood.

269
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,416
And yet, you're
still assisting

270
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
with your
grandfather's research.

271
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,500
Using the children
as you were used.

272
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,208
So, tell me, what
are you planning?!

273
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,625
You've done your
homework, haven't you.

274
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,333
But what you still
don't seem to realize

275
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,916
is that I don't answer to
anybody other than myself.

276
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,541
Moron!

277
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,750
And now you're going to try
forcing me to reveal my plans.

278
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,333
That sound.

279
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,708
It's Capacity Down!

280
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,250
You're familiar
with it, then?

281
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,958
Why do you have it, though?

282
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,291
Why wouldn't I have it?

283
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,291
I am its creator,
after all!

284
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,791
You are?

285
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,000
As it happens, I gathered a
lot of helpful information

286
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,375
from loaning it out to
those idiots in Skill Out.

287
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,500
So this new version is
significantly more powerful.

288
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,583
Though that did require making
the device a good deal larger.

289
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,000
Apparently, even a band
of fools like Skill Out

290
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,625
can be somewhat useful.

291
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,583
-Stop screwing around with me.
-Huh?

292
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,000
Using Skill Out, too?!

293
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,791
They aren't your lab rats!

294
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,000
No need for hysterics.

295
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,833
I missed.

296
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,541
Calibration's a bit off

297
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,791
but I guess that'll just draw
the fun out a little longer.

298
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,125
Why, you...!

299
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,875
My power...

300
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,500
Poor girl. Haven't
you noticed that

301
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,250
none of your attacks
are reaching me?

302
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,666
Keep running,
my darling Level Five,

303
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,208
but it won't do
you any good.

304
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,125
Goodness. What on earth
is going on out there?

305
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,041
All that smoke.

306
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,583
It looks like a
disaster area.

307
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,708
Huh? Isn't that.

308
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,958
It's Misaka!

309
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:45,875
People like you
and your friends

310
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,916
are such fascinating
specimens.

311
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,791
In thrall to your own
naive sense of justice.

312
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,458
I owe you my gratitude.

313
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,750
It's all thanks to you

314
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,458
that I was able to track
down the test subjects.

315
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,958
As a reward, I'll let you
in on a little secret.

316
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,916
I needed access
to those children

317
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,208
because I intend to perfect
the ability crystal.

318
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,083
No... You... can't...

319
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,541
Oh, can't I?

320
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,375
Who's going to
stand in my way?

321
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,625
We've got a new candidate
for experimentation.

322
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,125
Someone take her away.

323
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,708
Just a moment!

324
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,166
I'll have you know,
that girl you're carrying

325
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,291
is a friend of mine.

326
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,708
And you do not
want to cross

327
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,250
Mitsuko Kongo of
Tokiwadai Middle School!

328
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,833
All units, report status.

329
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,208
Yellow Marble..
good to go.

330
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,333
Brown Marble.. good to go.

331
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,250
All units, you are clear
to proceed as planned...

332
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,791
This is Blue
Marble reporting.

333
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,875
-We've lost Railgun!
-You what?!

334
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,375
I apologize.

335
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,791
We're currently searching
the surrounding area.

336
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,166
-We'll find her.
-Never mind!

337
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,666
But I will not soon forget
today's incompetence!

338
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,166
Sissy!

339
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,125
Misaka! Are you all right?

340
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,125
How do you feel?
Are you hurt at all?

341
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,416
I'm confused...

342
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,791
What happened?

343
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,041
Well, I'm not one to brag,

344
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,958
but it all worked out,
thanks to me.

345
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,541
I'm certain you'd love to
hear all about my heroic rescue

346
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,500
but really, there isn't
that much to tell.

347
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,166
Oh, all right,
if you insist.

348
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,250
I'd hate to deprive you of a
thrilling tale of selflessness.

349
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,500
Really? So Kongo saved me?

350
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,166
Therestina.

351
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,666
Sit back down, Sissy.

352
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,791
You need to
rest some more.

353
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,833
Get out of my way.

354
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,791
I don't have time to be
lounging around in bed now.

355
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,083
I need to go.

356
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,291
I have to help
the children!

357
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,416
You're staying here, Sissy.

358
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,750
What a fool! I snuck into
the laboratory on my own

359
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,500
and lost my temper.

360
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,750
I found the children,

361
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,166
but I led Therestina
straight to them as well.

362
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,250
And now they're all gone.

363
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,208
They're gone,
and it's entirely my fault.

364
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,583
Don't you see?

365
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,666
I have to stop her
and make this right.

366
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,125
So stand aside, Kuroko.

367
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,000
What are you doing?

368
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,958
Misaka...

369
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,166
I want you to
stop for a minute.

370
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,750
Look around and
tell me what you see.

371
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,708
What are you
talking about?

372
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,541
I see you, standing there.

373
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,291
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,708
Really.

375
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,708
You're right.

376
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,458
I was... I was being selfish.

377
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,208
And... I've gone and caused
trouble for you all again.

378
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,500
It isn't any trouble.

379
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,958
Really. But I'd rather
fight together with you

380
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,833
than worry about you out
there all on your own again.

381
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,166
You know.

382
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,458
That's what friends
are for, isn't it?

383
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,041
Saten's right!

384
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,000
You're not alone.
You've got all of us!

385
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,625
Yeah, I know I do.

386
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,875
Thanks, you guys.

387
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,916
You're next, Uiharu.

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,916
You'll apologize to Shirai.

389
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,125
Tell her you're
sorry for the way

390
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,625
you've been treating
her through all this!

391
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,541
Hey, hold on!
That's not fair!

392
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,208
You, too, Shirai...

393
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,291
Apologize to Uiharu
for slapping her!

394
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,708
I'm sorry for
how I've behaved.

395
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,375
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

396
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,958
So? Don't you have something
to say to me, as well?

397
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,125
Yes, I do.
Thanks, Kongo.

398
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,291
Oh, it was
nothing, really.

399
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,541
We now have
irrefutable evidence

400
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,791
that Therestina Kihara is
involved in illegal activities.

401
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,250
We've always suspected

402
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,416
there was something suspicious
about her organization.

403
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,416
We're looking
into her, too...

404
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,791
We don't have
any time to waste.

405
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,083
We need to be
doing something!

406
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,625
Can't Antiskill help out?

407
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,083
It isn't that easy
for us to get involved.

408
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,208
There are limits
to what we can do.

409
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,708
Oh, yeah? What about
finding the strength

410
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,250
to overcome your limits?

411
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,333
It's you...
from the workshop.

412
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,125
You're the one who said that
when you convince yourself

413
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,875
you can't do any more,
you're finished.

414
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,791
Well, we can't
give up. Not now.

415
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,125
The children need us!

416
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,083
Okay. Give me
a little time.

417
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,708
I'm receiving satellite
surveillance data

418
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,291
from Antiskill.

419
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,833
The MAR trailers are
on Urban Expressway Five,

420
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,000
just passing
the interchange

421
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,666
for School District Eighteen.

422
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,291
Urban Expressway Five.

423
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,625
That leads to District
Seventeen, doesn't it?

424
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,041
Why District Seventeen?

425
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,666
Do they have some reason
for heading there?

426
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,958
I think so.

427
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,583
Gensei Kihara had a
private lab in that area.

428
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,916
Well, let's see.

429
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,041
Here. Can you zoom in enough

430
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,958
to see what's
behind the trailers?

431
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,125
Sure.

432
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,958
Dr. Kiyama!

433
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,166
Geez, she's going
after them on her own?

434
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,791
How can she take
this all on herself?

435
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,041
Really, Sissy?

436
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,708
You know it's
almost impossible

437
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,291
not to say something
sarcastic now.

438
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,833
Yeah, it sounds like you've got
a lot in common with Kiyama.

439
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,833
Hey, now. That isn't true.

440
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,875
So, is there something I'm
supposed to be doing here?

441
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,625
'Huh?' Oh, are
you still around?

442
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,125
Here, wash it
down with this.

443
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,458
We can't fight on
empty stomachs, can we?

444
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,083
-Now eat up, everyone!
-Right!

445
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,416
Huh?... What is
this recording?

446
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:41,583
[Music]

447
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:48,000
[Music]

448
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,375
All right, then.

449
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,458
Let's get going!

450
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:56,500
[Music]

451
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,875
We've got work to do!

452
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,500
We'll defeat Therestina...

453
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,458
-find Haru'ue...
-and Kiyama...

454
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:07,541
And then...

455
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,291
We'll save the children!
