1
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,875
Computational device?

2
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,500
By using the AIM diffusion
field as a medium,

3
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,375
I was able to
construct a network...

4
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,833
and by distributing
the processing

5
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,500
across multiple brains...

6
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,916
I can enable complex
computations...

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,625
That's what the Level
Upper really is.

8
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,666
But why?

9
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,875
I requested the use
of Tree Diagram...

10
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,000
I needed access to it to
perform certain simulations...

11
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,541
but for whatever reason,
I was denied.

12
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,000
I needed a computational
device in its place.

13
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,333
You've used their brains
to construct a computer?

14
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,583
I've put about ten thousand
of them together...

15
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,500
That should be an
adequate substitute.

16
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,541
Don't give me such
a reproachful look.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,416
It will all be
over soon enough.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,875
And once it is,
everyone will be released.

19
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,875
This is a treatment program...

20
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:31,791
It will uninstall
the Level Upper.

21
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,083
I'm giving it to you.

22
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,125
There are no lasting
aftereffects.

23
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,583
Everything will
return to normal,

24
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,041
and nobody will be
lost in the process.

25
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,458
And I'm supposed
to trust you...?

26
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,666
You give me this thing

27
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,708
that probably hasn't
even been tested before,

28
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,625
and I should just take it
without asking questions?

29
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,208
You have quite a
harsh view of me.

30
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,250
Yes. Dr. Kiyama is
not at this location.

31
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,000
Copy that...
We are seizing all data.

32
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,333
What is all this?

33
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,916
That's not good.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,250
It looks like they've
already arrived.

35
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,250
It hasn't been long enough

36
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,833
since they lost
contact with you

37
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,333
for that to be the reason
they're making this move...

38
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,416
They must have figured
it out some other way.

39
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,041
I programmed my equipment with
security measures in the event

40
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,958
it was booted without
following designated protocols.

41
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,458
Those measures have
been activated,

42
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,375
which means all data on the
Level Upper has been lost...

43
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,583
The only means of waking
the sleepers now

44
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,458
is what you're holding
there in your hand.

45
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,916
So take good care of it.

46
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,833
Attention, Harumi Kiyama!

47
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,833
Antiskill is here, huh...?

48
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,125
One thing that I
can say for them

49
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,666
is that they
sure move fast

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,458
when their orders
come from the top.

51
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,791
You are under arrest

52
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,000
for suspicion of distributing
the Level Upper...

53
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,750
Surrender yourself at once.

54
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,416
What are you gonna do...?

55
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,416
It looks like this is the
end of the line for you.

56
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,625
The Level Upper
is a program...

57
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,750
It was designed for making
computing equipment

58
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,333
through the use of
human brain activity...

59
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,916
but that isn't all.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,208
It also generates a certain
byproduct within its users.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,041
I've got an interesting
demonstration for you.

62
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:38,083
[Music]

63
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,333
I want you to slowly place
both hands behind your head

64
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,916
and lie down
on your stomach.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,875
The girl hostage
appears unharmed.

66
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,166
Secure her!

67
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,041
What was that?!

68
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,916
I... I can't control myself!

69
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,333
Impossible...!
She's an esper?!

70
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,541
Keep the change...

71
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,833
and please, get out
of here quickly.

72
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,000
Why? What's happening?

73
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,416
Kuroko, tell me
what's going on!

74
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,250
Kuroko!

75
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,000
Antiskill managed
to locate Kiyama,

76
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,166
but she's engaging them...

77
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,916
What's more...
She's using an ability.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you saying...?

79
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,541
Is she an esper?

80
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,458
The databank doesn't
show any record of her

81
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,458
receiving any
ability development.

82
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,833
Even so...

83
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,291
She is clearly using
some kind of ability ...

84
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,541
And what's more,
it looks like

85
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,541
there have to be multiple
abilities in play.

86
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,791
No way!

87
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,291
No one ever has more
than one ability.

88
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,000
There are no exceptions,
are there?

89
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,291
Maybe it has something to
do with the Level Upper.

90
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,166
In her system, she
has ten thousand espers

91
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,416
synaptically linked

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,041
by some kind of bizarre
computer network...

93
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,416
They can be thought
of as one giant brain.

94
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,916
If she can really
control them,

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,333
she should be
able to do things

96
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,750
that no normal brain
could do alone.

97
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,250
If my guess is correct,

98
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,000
then Kiyama's become
something entirely new.

99
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,791
The phantom being
that nobody thought

100
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,291
could actually exist...

101
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,333
A compound esper...

102
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,583
"Dual Skill."

103
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,583
Antiskill's wiped out...

104
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,916
All of them.

105
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,708
Uiharu!

106
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:07,916
Are you all right?

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,125
You can relax.

108
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,375
She just caught
an aftershock

109
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,416
from the fighting
and got knocked out...

110
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,083
Her life is in no danger.

111
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,375
Mikoto Misaka ...

112
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,416
One of only seven Level
5's in Academy City...

113
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,458
Despite your extensive
skill and experience,

114
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,375
I doubt you have fought
against an opponent like me.

115
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,208
Do you think you'll
be able to stop me

116
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,500
when I have the power of ten
thousand minds at my disposal?

117
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,333
That's what you
want to know...?

118
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,125
Can I stop you...?

119
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,250
Of course I can!

120
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,666
You're full of surprises.

121
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,958
You really can use

122
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,666
a lot of different abilities,
can't you...?

123
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,666
This "Dual Skill" thing's
pretty fascinating...

124
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,541
It should make for an
interesting battle.

125
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,333
You'll find my ability is
different in nature and in name

126
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,791
than the impossible
power people speak of...

127
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,583
It should be called...

128
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,750
Multiskill.

129
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,166
Call it whatever you want,
for all I care...

130
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,416
A new name won't change
what I'm going to do to you!

131
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,166
Is something wrong?

132
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,250
You knew I could use
multiple abilities,

133
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,458
but you didn't think I
could use them all at once?

134
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,625
Is she insane...?

135
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,000
She wields those abilities

136
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,000
without any concern of
getting caught up in them?!

137
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,916
That was anticlimactic...

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,208
I would've thought
a Level Five

139
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,166
would be capable
of more than that.

140
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,666
So you were able to counter
one of my shocks...

141
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,083
Don't think that
means you've won!

142
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,166
Huh?

143
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,791
Oh, crap!

144
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,458
Why don't you stop
this foolishness?

145
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,000
There's just one
little matter

146
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,708
that I need to look
into further...

147
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,083
and once that's done,
I'll release all of them.

148
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,166
I won't sacrifice anyone.

149
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,083
Are you kidding me?!

150
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,416
You won't sacrifice anyone...?

151
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,250
What about all the people
you've dragged into this?

152
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,333
What about all the people whose
lives you've toyed with...?!

153
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,583
After all you've done

154
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,166
there's no chance you're
getting away with it!

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,916
Good grief.
You may be a Level 5

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,625
but still,
you have no idea

157
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,708
how the world
works, do you?

158
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,916
Not the twisted
world you live in!

159
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,375
You undergo a special
"ability development"

160
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,958
on a daily basis.

161
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,000
Do you really think everything
they do in this city

162
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,375
is safe and humane?

163
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,125
The powers that be in Academy
City are concealing something

164
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,333
very important about
these abilities.

165
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,500
The teachers who work here
know nothing about it.

166
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,250
But they're still
"developing" the brains

167
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,166
of their young
students every day.

168
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,875
Can you begin to understand
how dangerous that might be?

169
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,833
I'll admit that's quite an
interesting story you just told.

170
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,916
And I'll be sure to take a
nice, long look into it.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,875
Once I've taken
you into custody!

172
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,291
That will have to wait...

173
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,791
I've got other things to
tend to at the moment.

174
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,416
Empty cans...?

175
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,458
Gravitons!

176
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,166
So, what will you do now?

177
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,833
That's easy...

178
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,041
Blow them away!

179
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,708
That's very impressive...

180
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,875
Too bad.

181
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,375
Well...? I made
short work of those.

182
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,291
Are we done ye...

183
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,000
I expected you to give me
more trouble than that...

184
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,625
Is that really
all you've got?

185
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,125
Level 5?

186
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,416
I suppose you'll
hold it against me.

187
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,583
Look at that...

188
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,833
I caught you.

189
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,125
Impossible!

190
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,208
You used magnetics to
make yourself a shield.

191
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,791
I'll shock you at
point blank range.

192
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,333
It didn't work against
this idiot I know...

193
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,291
but I don't think even
you possess an ability

194
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,000
as out of this
world as his is.

195
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,291
Too slow!

196
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,500
I admit, I did hold
back on you a little.

197
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,708
-Teacher?
-Teacher!

198
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,125
-What the-...?
-Teacher!

199
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,583
I'm hearing this
directly in my head.

200
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,041
Teacher!

201
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,041
-Am I...
-Teacher!

202
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,208
am I hearing Dr.
iyama's memories?

203
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,625
Teacher?

204
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,833
I must have created an
electrical circuit between us

205
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,500
that allows me to hear them.

206
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,666
Teacher!

207
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,166
Hi, Miss Kiyama!

208
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,125
Me, a teacher?

209
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,166
This must be some
kind of joke, right?

210
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,541
Not at all...

211
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,875
Why, is there a problem?

212
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,083
You do have a teaching
certificate, don't you?

213
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,500
Yes.

214
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,125
In that case what could
be out of place about you

215
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,833
taking up a position
as a teacher?

216
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,208
That certificate's

217
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,166
just something I happened
to get along the way.

218
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,083
I know research is
your preferred area...

219
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,666
I'm not asking
you to give it up.

220
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,000
Far from it in fact;

221
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,250
I'm asking you to head up
a high level experiment

222
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,750
that's being backed by the
board of directors themselves.

223
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,541
You really mean it?

224
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,458
You see those
children down there?

225
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,666
They're what we refer
to as "Child Errors."

226
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,916
For whatever reason,

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,708
they were abandoned
here in Academy City...

228
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,625
They have no other family.

229
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,083
Ah...

230
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,500
They are also the subjects
of this experiment...

231
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,625
as well as the students
who you will be teaching.

232
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,083
In order for the
experiment to succeed,

233
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,000
we will need to keep
detailed growth data

234
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,375
on each one of the subjects,
analyze them meticulously,

235
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,625
and make any necessary
adjustments as time goes on.

236
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,041
I'm sure you can see

237
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,208
that having their
teacher handle

238
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,625
that will save a
lot of trouble.

239
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,375
I guess so.

240
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,125
It does sound
more efficient.

241
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,708
Uh... my name is Harumi Kiyama

242
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,083
and starting today I'm
going to be your teacher...

243
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,208
Nice to meet you.

244
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,291
Nice to meet you,
too, teacher!

245
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,416
This is not gonna be easy.

246
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,666
Ha--ha...!
She fell for it!

247
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,875
We got the Teacher!
We got the Teacher!

248
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,750
Hey, you two!

249
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,875
Are you okay Miss Kiyama?

250
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,500
Yeah... It's a sunny day.

251
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,375
This shouldn't take
long to dry outside.

252
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,625
You can't change
your clothes out here!

253
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,875
Boys! Look away, right now!

254
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:58,500
Seriously, you can't do that
in the middle of a classroom!

255
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,833
Aw, gimme a break.

256
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,458
It's not like we'd be
interested in a flat chest

257
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,916
like that anyway.

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,125
Me...? Flat--chested?

259
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,666
I hate children.

260
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,416
They have no decency.

261
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,625
You're not really
very pretty, Teacher...

262
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,125
Do you have a boyfriend?

263
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,583
Wh... what was that?

264
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,875
Didn't think so.

265
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,666
But I'll be your
boyfriend if you want.

266
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,916
They have no manners.

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,583
And if you'll just
look at your books...

268
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,083
They play stupid pranks.

269
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,625
I see that you're sad...

270
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,041
If there's something
bothering you,

271
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,500
I'd be happy to listen.

272
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,125
They're far too emotional.

273
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,583
Hey...! You
can't be fussy.

274
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,708
Eat it all!

275
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,333
They're overly familiar,

276
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,125
and they become
attached too quickly.

277
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,125
I really hate children.

278
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,416
Edasaki.What's wrong?

279
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,041
Oh, Miss Kiyama!

280
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,875
I slipped in the
rain and fell.

281
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,875
My apartment isn't
far from here...

282
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,291
Would you like to wash up?

283
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,375
You mean it?!

284
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,583
Wow! A bathtub!

285
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,500
Is taking a bath
that exciting?

286
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,375
Yeah. At my facility, we
only get two showers a week.

287
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,208
So... can I really use it?

288
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,458
Yeah.

289
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,125
Hooray...! I'm gonna
brag to all the others!

290
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,375
Teacher?

291
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,916
Do you think if I
tried really hard,

292
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,958
I could make it to
Level 4 or even 5 someday?

293
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,625
At this stage it's too early
to know one way or the other.

294
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,875
Do you want to be a high--level
esper when you get older?

295
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,375
Well, of course.
I mean, who wouldn't?

296
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:14,625
But Academy City's going to
all this trouble to raise me.

297
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,833
I'd like an ability

298
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,958
that would help the city
in return, you know?

299
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,875
With all this work,

300
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,958
I have no time for my
research anymore...

301
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,166
Teaching is a real
pain in the neck.

302
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,625
On top of which....

303
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,416
I hate children.

304
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,208
They're indelicate,
annoying, and loud.

305
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,833
Hey, Teacher... will you
be my girlfriend, please?

306
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,833
Yeah, whatever.

307
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,458
They have no manners.

308
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,583
Yay!

309
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,500
They play stupid pranks.

310
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,791
-Oh... is that me?
-Mhm!

311
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,000
They're far too emotional.

312
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,833
It's a surprise
party just for you!

313
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,666
Happy birthday, Teacher!

314
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,291
-How old are you now?
-Aren't you surprised?

315
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,041
Do you like
the decorations?

316
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,125
What did we say?

317
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,416
You have to eat it all.

318
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,250
Right.

319
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,958
I knew you could do it!

320
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,000
Children are...

321
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,166
You'll feel a
slight prick.

322
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:56,916
Anything unusual here?

323
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,625
No, no problems so far.

324
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,708
We're fine, too.

325
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,125
Okay, great.

326
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,875
Are you frightened?

327
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,500
Not one bit. After all, you're
in charge of this experiment,

328
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,625
aren't you?

329
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,125
I completely trust
you, Teacher.

330
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,041
Do I finally get to stop
playing teacher now?

331
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,000
Dopamine levels
are dropping!

332
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,291
Anticholinergics are
having no effect!

333
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,875
Hypovolemic shock is
setting in from the burns.

334
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,125
Lactated Ringer's solution.
Transfusion, stat!

335
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,125
There's nothing
more we can do.

336
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,000
Uh... Hurry and
contact the hospital!

337
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,250
No... we won't do
anything of the sort.

338
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,791
But if we don't do
something right now...

339
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,375
Are you a
scientist or not?

340
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,708
Don't get frantic, just
gather all the data you can.

341
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,791
I'm ordering you to keep this
experiment strictly in--house.

342
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,750
Everything was completed
here without any incident...

343
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,416
Nobody saw anything
out of the ordinary...

344
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,666
Understood?

345
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,083
Y... Yes, sir.

346
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,708
Don't worry you did your job
and you did it well...

347
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,333
It is a pity this had
to happen to them.

348
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,000
But that's how scientific
progress is made, after all.

349
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,500
You don't need to worry yourself
about this little accident...

350
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,416
I'm still expecting great
things from you in the future.

351
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,708
What was that?

352
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,375
You saw what they...

353
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,708
we did?

354
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,875
Half the street's
been blown away.

355
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,333
It's Misaka!

356
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,708
What...

357
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,958
What were they doing?

358
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,666
On the record
or off of it....?

359
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,041
Officially, it was designed

360
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,375
as a test in controlling
AIM diffusion fields...

361
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,750
but... the real study...

362
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,708
was on the effects of
pushing an ability

363
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,291
beyond its natural limit.

364
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,500
They over--stimulated the
children's AIM diffusion fields

365
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,541
in order to study runaway
abilities first--hand.

366
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,625
Then...

367
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,041
They were intentionally
manipulated

368
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,125
to run out of control...

369
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,750
but I didn't realize
what was going on

370
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,083
until after it happened.

371
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,416
Experiments...
on the children.

372
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,458
Innocent little kids...

373
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,416
And even after
all this time...

374
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
they still
haven't woken up.

375
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,250
We stole their youth from
them, and for what...?!

376
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,666
To turn them into
laboratory rats?!

377
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,083
But...

378
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,541
If something that
terrible happened,

379
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,458
why didn't you report
it to Antiskill?

380
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,750
23 times.

381
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,041
That's how many times I
requested to use Tree Diagram...

382
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,666
If I could just
get access to it,

383
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,125
I could use it to find
a way to revive them...

384
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,500
I could run simulations

385
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,333
to uncover the true
cause of the accident.

386
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,666
Tree Diagram is the
greatest supercomputer

387
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,208
in Academy City...

388
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,666
If I'd had it, I could have
brought those children back...

389
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,708
I could've set them free

390
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,375
to laugh and run
and play in the park

391
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,541
like children
are supposed to.

392
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,041
But I was always
turned down...

393
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,791
twenty--three times,
they said "no"!

394
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,166
Don't you get it?

395
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,791
The board of directors
was in on it!

396
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,208
There's no way
Antiskill would act!

397
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,000
There must have been a
better solution than this!

398
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,875
You understand nothing!

399
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,083
I would do anything
to save them...

400
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,125
anything in the
entire world!

401
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,750
The whole city can
hate and revile me.

402
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,041
I don't care!

403
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,958
I'm not going to let
anything stop me now!

404
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,708
Hey... what's wrong?

405
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,958
The network...

406
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,500
it's out of control.

407
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,125
Oh, gosh... what's that?!

408
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,375
A fetus...?

409
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:37,333
[Music]

410
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,708
I'm putting a stop
to Kiyama's scheme...

411
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,958
I will find a way to save
Saten and the others...

412
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,250
But what is that thing?!

413
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,000
Nobody said anything
about fighting a monster!
