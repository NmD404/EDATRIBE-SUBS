1
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,750
Ugh...

2
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,416
I'm so sick
of this heat.

3
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,500
It isn't even pleasant
to eat outside anymore.

4
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,250
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

5
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,375
But at least we have that
really strong sunblock

6
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,833
to put on... right?

7
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,500
You did put the sunblock
on before coming outside,

8
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,791
right, Sissy?

9
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:53,916
Huh...? Why would I?

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,125
Are you a dermatological
idiot...?

11
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,250
Ultraviolet rays are
the skin's enemy...

12
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,500
You don't want
your beautiful,

13
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,166
creamy white skin covered
in freckles, do you?

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,291
But we won't let that
happen, now will we...?

15
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,666
Just hold still while
I rub this over

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,583
every last inch
of your body.

17
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,166
Uh, no thanks.

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,041
Come on, there's no
need to be shy, Sissy.

19
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,500
I only want to look
after your health.

20
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,875
I promise, this will be much
easier if you let me just-

21
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,750
-Knock it off!
-Shirai?

22
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,708
Oh, hi there, Wannai.

23
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:17,958
And Awatsuki, too...

24
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,166
What's up?

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,375
Actually, we wanted
to ask you a favor.

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:34,250
[Music]

27
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:40,958
[Music]

28
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,750
Swimsuit modeling?

29
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,416
Yes... The swim
club is involved

30
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,333
with this swimsuit
manufacturer...

31
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,541
They've been insisting
we do this for them.

32
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,375
Apparently, it'll be in
the upcoming issue

33
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,875
of their web catalog.

34
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,666
The older girls in
the club are all busy

35
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,291
competing in
a swim meet...

36
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,666
Which means we're the
only ones available

37
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,208
to participate.

38
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,625
This is perfect...! We
have to help them out, Sissy.

39
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,916
Hmm...

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,916
Me wearing a swimsuit
and modeling...?

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It doesn't sound like
something I'd be good at...

42
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,208
I don't know...

43
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,000
Of course. We
totally understand.

44
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,083
Thanks, I'm sorry-

45
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,000
I thought better of
you than this!

46
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,416
These poor girls are
in desperate need

47
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,875
of our assistance...

48
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,916
Yet you refuse to
volunteer your time?

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,208
How uncharitable!

50
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,250
I'm tearing up...
it's so tragic!

51
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,666
Hey...! You wanna chip in?

52
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,625
All right. If you don't
think I'll be too bad at it,

53
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,083
I'll help you out.

54
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,083
That's the selfless
Sissy I know!

55
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,416
I'm so glad!

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,208
Yes, thank you! We
really appreciate it!

57
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,458
Excellent...! I get to
spend a whole day with Sissy

58
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,666
in a swimsuit!

59
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,083
I gonna have to pick out a
really sexy bikini to model...!

60
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,125
Yes... I'll have
her salivating!

61
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,666
I know there are dirty thoughts
going through your head.

62
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,041
I give!

63
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,166
I didn't know it was
such a big business!

64
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,583
It's exciting and
intimidating

65
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,791
all at the same time!

66
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,333
Uiharu!

67
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,500
It's great that you were
able to get your friends

68
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,375
to come along,
thanks again!

69
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,791
It was no problem.

70
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,333
With something like this,
the more the merrier,

71
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,625
don't ya think?

72
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,416
Eh, so after seeing us,
are you sure you want us

73
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,708
to play swimsuit models?

74
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,083
Don't worry so much.

75
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,541
Modern fashion designers
have come up with

76
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,916
all sorts of ways to make
even underdeveloped bodies

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,833
look more appealing
to the eye.

78
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,875
Thank you for your
support, Shirai.

79
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,166
Sorry to keep you waiting.

80
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,083
Who is she?

81
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,125
She's the manufacturer's
general manager.

82
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,541
Thanks for coming today.

83
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,833
It's gonna be great...

84
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,000
Uh... weren't there
two more coming?

85
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,208
More models?

86
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,666
Well, hello, Shirai.

87
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,500
Ugh... I know that voice.

88
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,416
Oh, my, look at all the
people who are with you!

89
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,916
Is this a social
studies field trip

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,625
for school, or something?

91
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,375
Oh, hi there, Kongo.

92
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,791
And Konori's here, too!

93
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,458
What do you have to
say for yourself?

94
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,833
Why are you wearing
that outfit?

95
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,208
The school rule dictates
that we wear our uniforms

96
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,625
even on days off.

97
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,958
Or have you
forgotten that?

98
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,333
For this afternoon
at least,

99
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,083
I am no mere student of
Tokiwadai Middle School...

100
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,625
I am here as a model...

101
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,625
Naturally, I
dressed as such.

102
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,666
A model...?

103
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,458
They asked you, too?

104
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,000
Huh...? You don't
mean... are you-?

105
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,166
Did you come for the swimsuit
modeling as well, Konori?

106
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,291
Yeah. I ran into a
classmate at the gym,

107
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,583
and she asked me if I'd be
willing to come today...

108
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,291
What about you guys?

109
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,958
We've got some friends
in the swim club,

110
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,541
and they asked
us to help out.

111
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,750
It's obvious that none
of you have done anything

112
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,333
like this before...

113
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,500
I'd be delighted to give
you a pointer or two.

114
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,041
From a pro...

115
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,083
I've been modeling ever
since I was a little girl.

116
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,666
The thunderous applause
echoing off all the walls...

117
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,666
the cheers
screaming my name!

118
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,833
I can still hear their
ardent admiration, even now!

119
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,541
Give me a break. I
bet the only person

120
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,000
cheering for you
was your mother.

121
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,125
Now... shall we get
down to business?

122
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,916
Will you show me to
the changing rooms?

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,041
Uh... sure...

124
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,458
Right this way.

125
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,791
I must be dressed in a
suit that flatters my curves.

126
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,541
Is that girl an
acquaintance of yours?

127
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,791
She's more like somebody I
wish I wasn't acquainted with.

128
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,750
All right! Everybody
please choose

129
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,500
whichever swimsuit
you prefer.

130
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,166
Okay!

131
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,791
Hey, look... what do
you think of this?

132
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,833
Wow... that's a
really pretty one.

133
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,208
Oh...! This one's
really cute.

134
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,458
I think I found
one I like, too.

135
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,125
Hmm... This doesn't
look that great...

136
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,000
and I don't care
for this one... Hmm...

137
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,250
Haven't you decided
on a suit yet?

138
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,375
It seems like you could
use some tutoring.

139
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,666
Why don't you allow me
to select one for you?

140
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,250
I don't need your
help, thanks.

141
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,500
Halter--top suits are best for
those with a nice bust...

142
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,416
and then there are
triangle--top bikinis,

143
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,583
which always work well,

144
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,041
whether you have
the goods or not.

145
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,125
I said no thanks.
Now go away.

146
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,708
It's obvious which
one you'll need.

147
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,208
You have my sympathy.

148
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,083
I look forward to sitting
you down and having a nice,

149
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,958
long chat one
of these days, Kongo.

150
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,166
Wow, look what
Misaka found.

151
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,750
It's so cute!

152
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, yeah. Frills and polka--dots
work so well together.

153
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,791
No, you've got it wrong...

154
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,791
I don't want to wear
this one or anything...

155
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,916
I'd love to see you in
that one...! It's perfect.

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,291
I know it'll look
adorable on you!

157
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,166
I agree...! What's the
harm in trying it on?

158
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,416
I don't know...

159
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,875
I don't think it's
the right fit.

160
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,541
Don't be like that.
Give it a chance!

161
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,791
It'll look great.

162
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,875
No doubt in my mind!

163
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,208
You really think so...?

164
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,375
Well, if you guys insist,
I'll give it a shot.

165
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,708
Oh, nice... I take it you
prefer designs that look more

166
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,333
child--like, Misaka?

167
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,916
No...! Of course I don't.
I was just browsing...

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,375
Here... this is what I want...

169
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,458
I'll just take it over
here and try it on.

170
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,125
Um... what's wrong...? Was
it something that I said?

171
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,000
Why do I have to be
so embarrassed

172
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,791
about the stuff I like?

173
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,041
I... I feel practically
naked wearing this thing.

174
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,458
We're all girls
here, Uiharu.

175
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,791
There's nothing
to be shy about.

176
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,791
Plus that looks
great on you!

177
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,333
It does? Really?

178
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,416
A bikini divides the eyeline
between top and bottom...

179
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,291
but a one--piece shows off
a woman's entire figure...

180
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,958
so they only flatter
truly slender people.

181
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,083
Oh... Is that swim
club knowledge?

182
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,125
Do you have any
other pointers

183
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,291
for picking out
a suit to wear?

184
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,916
Well, let me think...

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,291
sarongs are an option...

186
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,958
they are, of course,
fashionable...

187
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,500
and they're also useful
for covering the lower body.

188
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,833
It's not like I was
trying to hide anything.

189
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,291
I just thought
it was cute!

190
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,291
Sorry for taking so long.

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,416
I am a little disappointed
that all the designs

192
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,958
they had were so
tame like this.

193
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,916
But given that these are
off--the--rack swimsuits,

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,958
what more can
a girl expect?

195
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,083
I don't know what to say.

196
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,958
We probably shouldn't
be surprised.

197
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,375
Uh... individuality's
important in a model.

198
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,750
It sure is.

199
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,083
Modest as it is, I'm
sure this must be

200
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,500
driving you crazy, Sissy.

201
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,541
I know it'll be difficult,
but please, try to resist!

202
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,833
I don't think I'm gonna
have a hard time with that.

203
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,458
Oh, look at you girls...

204
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,625
Is that all you're
working with?

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,125
Well, what do you think...?
Impressive, huh...?

206
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,625
I'm working the
"sexy and exotic" angle.

207
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,416
I expect rave reviews.

208
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,166
It's the ultimate swimsuit
experience for the audience.

209
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,083
That's a snake!

210
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,875
-I think it's cute!
-Her name is Ecaterina.

211
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,833
Oh, look at that.
What a pretty python.

212
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,333
You do realize it's a snake
not a dog... Don't you?

213
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,333
Would you hurry up and
put that away already? !

214
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,625
Oh, why?

215
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,291
Don't you want to play
with this little cutie?

216
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,041
Pretty snake! Pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty snake!

217
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,250
What do you think, Shirai.
Surely you're not scared.

218
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,583
What...? Me...?

219
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,166
I think it's just a
tasteless stage prop.

220
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,458
It's a little bit tight...

221
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,000
but it's all they had...

222
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,791
They don't carry
larger sizes.

223
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,958
Oh, wow!

224
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,125
It's nothing but
an empty room.

225
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,666
This is where we're
going to be shooting?

226
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,666
It's so bare.

227
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,083
This high--tech studio
digitally creates

228
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,625
any number of
different settings.

229
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,833
Wow, that's amazing...!
I can even touch it.

230
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,041
It's the latest in
Academy City technology.

231
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,791
Oh... I was just wondering-is
the person shooting us

232
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,500
going to be a man?

233
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,916
Yeah... now that you mention
it, that's a good question.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,416
Even if he was a
professional,

235
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,750
it would still be kinda...

236
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,166
you know? I can't
stand amateurs...

237
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,916
Don't you people get it? The
whole point of modeling

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,958
is to be seen at
your sexiest.

239
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,583
All the photography
is automated.

240
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,083
The camera will never be
inside your field of view,

241
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,541
so you don't have
to worry about it.

242
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,333
Just act naturally, okay?

243
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:32,833
[Music]

244
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:38,791
[Music]

245
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,375
She said to act naturally

246
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,000
and nothing about that
looks natural to me.

247
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,875
Come on, Sissy. We need
to play our parts, too.

248
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,625
What parts do you mean?

249
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,166
Oh, you know...

250
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,583
You're the sexy beach babe
I apply suntan lotion to.

251
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,208
Not this again...!
I said no...!Ahh!

252
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,250
Aww! Just a little, please?
You'll like it!

253
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,541
Go away!

254
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,166
-Rub--a--dub--dub!
-No, no, no!

255
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,125
I get it now. That's
totally natural for them.

256
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,208
Yeah, that's
Misaka for you...

257
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,208
She always sets
a great example.

258
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,375
What do you guys think?
Should we follow her cue?

259
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,666
Yeah!

260
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,125
W--where are we now?

261
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,208
Wherever it is, it's
incredibly cold.

262
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,958
When the scenery
changes in the room,

263
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,500
the temperature changes, too?
That is high--tech.

264
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,750
I think this may be
taking it a little far.

265
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,583
We're supposed to be
relaxed and natural

266
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,291
in the middle
of a blizzard?

267
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,083
That's what makes
a real model...

268
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,916
Whatever happens,
you get the job done.

269
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,875
Serves you right for
being such a show--off.

270
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,916
Ow! Hot!!

271
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,416
From too cold to too warm.

272
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,000
Way, way too warm.

273
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,958
Why'd they program
in such extremes?

274
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,666
Water! Water!

275
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,208
Not this much water!

276
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,083
Like I said, what's with
all the extreme weather?

277
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,750
If they want to
put us on a boat,

278
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,541
can't they at least
make it comfortable?

279
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,250
Not bad...! A
prize barracuda!

280
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,416
Sorry... I think that's
just a really big tuna.

281
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,166
Is not!

282
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,083
Maybe you should let
her have her fantasy...

283
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,458
I'm sure she
doesn't want credit

284
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,291
for something
she didn't do.

285
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,333
Oh, I guess we're
off the boat.

286
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,166
Wow... the stars
are beautiful...!

287
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,708
And over there!

288
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,833
Looks a lot
like the Earth!

289
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,583
Huh?

290
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,458
Great, we're on
the moon, now? !

291
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,166
Well, at least
it's pretty.

292
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,333
Yeah. Very pretty.

293
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,000
Hey, you guys, look...!
What's that over there?

294
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,708
I'm sorry. Please hold
on a moment...

295
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,958
We need to make some adjustments
and change the scene.

296
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,000
Great. What are we
in for this time?

297
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,416
A campsite?

298
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,791
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,000
We're experiencing some
technical difficulties

300
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,458
with the cameras...

301
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,500
We should have it
taken care of soon...

302
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,083
In the meantime, why don't
you take a short break?

303
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,291
So, what do we do now?

304
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,625
Oh, by the way, the
food there is real...

305
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,750
Feel free to cook something
up if you want to.

306
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,625
Cook something up using
this stuff...?

307
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,291
What should we make?

308
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,500
With the number of people
and the ingredients we have...

309
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,166
We need to make
some curry!

310
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,250
Some of us can
work on the curry,

311
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,791
and the rest can do rice.

312
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,958
I'll be on team curry!

313
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,791
Yeah, me too, please.

314
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,500
All right. Why don't
I take the rice.

315
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,541
If you're making rice,
Sissy, that's what I'm doing!

316
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,958
Ugh... please...

317
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,208
curry is such a boorish,
unsophisticated food.

318
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,166
What are you talking
about? It's delicious.

319
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,166
You really don't
like curry?

320
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,666
I'm betting you just have
no idea how to make it.

321
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,250
Please! Don't be
ridiculous...!

322
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,208
I have a recipe for
the best curry.

323
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,708
It's been passed down
through the Kongo family

324
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,000
for generations!

325
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh...? What kind
of curry is it?

326
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,625
An authentic
family recipe?

327
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,875
I'd love to try it!

328
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,041
Yes, please
make it for us!

329
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,375
Well, since I'm
stuck here anyway,

330
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,791
I suppose I can make do

331
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,833
with whatever plebian
curry dish you all prefer.

332
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,041
We can make a normal
curry and your dish...

333
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,666
We've got lots
to work with.

334
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,375
That's a great idea!

335
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,833
Okay let's do it...

336
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:39,875
yeah? ! Well...

337
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,916
if you insist,
I guess we can.

338
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,541
Hooray!

339
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,375
All right... everything's
settled then...

340
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,375
We'll go and get
the rice started.

341
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,291
Right!

342
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,416
Be ready for
something amazing!

343
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,583
Um, excuse me, Kongo...

344
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,041
Oh...! Yes?

345
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,125
Would you mind
if we joined you?

346
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,166
We'd love to see
how it's done.

347
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,750
Uh... certainly,

348
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,541
if that's
what you want.

349
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,791
Shall we get started
cooking ladies?

350
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,625
First... why don't we...

351
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,041
uh... peel these onions?

352
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,708
Sure!

353
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,000
Stupid thing.

354
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,500
It's broken?

355
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,041
This isn't
working, either.

356
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,083
I know!

357
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,125
This is what I call
induction cooking!

358
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,375
Don't talk to me.

359
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,916
I have to concentrate,
or it's gonna boil over.

360
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,458
Could you do
this one, too?

361
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,333
What...? Don't tell
me there's more!

362
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,333
You get a lot less onion
after all that peeling, huh?

363
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,916
So, what are we supposed
to do with this?

364
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,041
Oh... well, we, uh...

365
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,000
That's what those things
on the side of the plate are!

366
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,208
Out of the whole
entire onion

367
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,750
they only use this
one tiny part? ...

368
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,833
It must be a precious
ingredient for all that work.

369
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,750
Well... feel like you're
learning some things?

370
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,333
Yes!

371
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,500
Thanks...

372
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,875
I mean that.

373
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,625
This is a great
experience...

374
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,791
It's so nice of
you to teach us.

375
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,375
It's embarrassing
to admit...

376
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,416
but neither one of us has
ever made a curry dish before.

377
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,583
It's an honor to learn
from someone so talented.

378
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,166
Now the carrots...

379
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,000
Do we cut them into
quarter--rounds?

380
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,583
Huh...? I think for curry,

381
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,291
they're supposed to
be in chunks.

382
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,208
But quarter--rounds will look
more appealing on the plate,

383
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,916
and besides, they'll cook
faster at that size.

384
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,166
Oh, Uiharu, don't you
know anything...?

385
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,666
The key to a good curry

386
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,208
is that the vegetables are
neither too big nor too small.

387
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,041
When we make curry at
home, we chop the veggies

388
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,750
up smaller so they
blend in with the sauce.

389
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,000
No, no, no!

390
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,208
You've got it
all wrong...!

391
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,833
You want the vegetables
to be large enough

392
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,333
to add some substance.

393
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,541
Making it taste good
is the bigger concern.

394
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,833
It tastes just
fine my way!

395
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,750
Let's settle this.

396
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,500
The vegetables should be cut
in bigger chunks, right?

397
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,041
No, chopping them
up is better, right?

398
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,875
Okay, now I 'm confused.

399
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,833
They're grating the corn?

400
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,916
Tomato skins, interesting.

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,708
They're pretty hard
to peel, aren't they?

402
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,791
And now we're
adding seaweed?

403
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,541
Also unexpected...

404
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,500
and difficult
to cut up, too.

405
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,875
We leave the peel
on the tangerine...

406
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,333
And slice it
into rounds...

407
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,083
Ah...! I got
juice in my eye!

408
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,833
Ow. That doesn't
sound like fun.

409
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,208
I wonder what the finished
product will be like.

410
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm just excited about
trying the first curry

411
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,166
I've ever made!

412
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,333
The ingredient choices
are all so unique!

413
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,500
I never would've thought
of adding burdock root.

414
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,166
Or strawberries...!

415
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,541
Ah... all this cooking
is making me hungry...!

416
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,041
I can hardly wait!

417
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,750
What's wrong?

418
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,250
What is it?

419
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,291
Um...

420
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,916
The truth is...

421
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
well...

422
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,291
You see, I...

423
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,250
I've never actually made this
curry recipe before, okay?

424
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,625
In fact, it's
not just this...

425
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,708
I've never done
any cooking.

426
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,291
I'm sorry...

427
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,791
It would have been too
embarrassing to back down

428
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,458
after what I'd said.

429
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,708
Well, in that case...

430
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,875
we can ask the others to
tell us how to make it.

431
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,083
Yeah?

432
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,333
I'm sure they
wouldn't mind.

433
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,625
Do it, Sissy...
do it, Sissy.

434
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,583
You can do it,
yes you can...!

435
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,375
Do it, Sissy...
do it, Sissy.

436
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,416
You can do it. Yes, you can!

437
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,750
Yeah! Time to eat!

438
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,416
Here we have
chicken curry!

439
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,625
Which is accompanied by
a lovely seafood curry.

440
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,916
Looks great!

441
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,708
Okay, everybody
ready to eat?

442
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,291
Absolutely!

443
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,083
Mmm... It's delicious!

444
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,375
You know, you really
can still taste

445
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,666
the little vegetables.

446
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,500
It's nice to have big
ones in there, too!

447
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,250
I'd say we did a pretty
good job, wouldn't you?

448
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,291
Yep. I couldn't agree more.

449
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,541
This is great, isn't it?

450
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,375
It was worth every
bit of effort.

451
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,375
Y--Yes.

452
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,166
See?

453
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,875
It tastes better because
we all worked together

454
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,250
to make it.

455
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,458
You know, you seem
like a nice person...

456
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,875
What's your name again?

457
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,625
Oh, um... I'm Mikoto Misaka.

458
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,166
Misaka? . . . That
sounds familiar...

459
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, in any case...

460
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,750
I've decided to give
you the opportunity

461
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,000
to become my friend...

462
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,583
How does that sound?

463
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,958
Uh, that sounds great...

464
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,791
Thanks a lot.

465
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,625
Sorry for the delay.

466
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,958
The system is
up and running,

467
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,250
so we'll resume
shooting now.

468
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,875
Huh...? Already?

469
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,375
Oh, you can
continue eating...

470
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,916
I think we can get some
great shots of that.

471
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,125
Mmm... that was fantastic!

472
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,583
I'll model anytime if
we get to eat like that.

473
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,375
It really was
a lot of fun.

474
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,791
I'm so glad you all
had a good time today.

475
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,416
I suppose eating
peasant food

476
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,291
isn't so bad every
once in a while.

477
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,708
You did have seconds.

478
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,125
Hey... where's Misaka?

479
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,791
Where'd she run off to?

480
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,750
Let's see here...

481
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,833
No, that's not it...

482
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,333
Maybe this one?

483
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,041
This bathing
suit is adorable!

484
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,041
Now then...

485
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,375
Woo.hoo!

486
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,875
-This is so much fun!
-That looks like Zapper...

487
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,583
but what is she doing? Weird.

488
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,208
I'm ready for
my close--up!

489
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:41,666
[Music]

490
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:55,041
[Music]

491
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,708
Who's there...? You
would dare to assault

492
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,125
Mitsuko Kongo of
Tokiwadai Middle School?

493
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,916
Um, I hate to
break it to you, Kongo,

494
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,375
but you're not actually
in the next one.
