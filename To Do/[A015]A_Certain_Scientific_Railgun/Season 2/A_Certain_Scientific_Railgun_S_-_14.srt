[KUROKO sighs]

2
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,708
Here we go again.

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,791
You're not coming home
tonight, are you, Sissy?

4
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:31,125
But earlier today you said all
of this would be over for good.

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,791
[KUROKO] The look on her face.

6
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,833
There was something there.

7
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,375
I cannot just
continue to ignore this.

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,916
There may well be something I
can do to help the situation.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,541
Regardless of what
Sissy might say.

10
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,041
No... I made up my mind.

11
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,291
I told myself I would wait.

12
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,833
[KUROKO] Sissy.

13
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,833
What is going on with you?

14
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,208
[gasps] No!

15
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,666
I must stop this right now!

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,958
If I breathe in her scent
for too long, I'll pass out.

17
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,375
I really hate this!

18
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:21,125
I wish there was some way
to know what I should do!

19
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,666
[bell rings]

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,583
[KUROKO] Just-Just a minute!

21
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:31,208
A visitor to the dorms?
That's unusual.

22
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,083
Yes?

23
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,208
[KAMIJO] Um, yeah, hi.

24
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,416
Is Misaka there?
This is Kamijo.

25
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,083
[KUROKO] Hm...

26
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,291
[KAMIJO] Hello? Are you there?

27
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,333
Is this stupid
thing even working?

28
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,083
[KUROKO] I know that face.

29
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,916
He's the troglodyte I saw with
Sissy by the vending machine!

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,666
He must have been
captivated by Sissy's beauty

31
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,791
and followed her back here!

32
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,375
She's in goodness knows how
much trouble, and he thinks

33
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,166
he can just casually make
an appearance like this!

34
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,666
I let him slide before
because I thought he would be

35
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,875
a good example for Sissy of
how useless boys truly are,

36
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,541
but this situation is swiftly
becoming unacceptable!

37
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,958
On the other hand!

38
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,875
There is the possibility
that he might know

39
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,750
something about Sissy!

40
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,708
This is room
two-oh-eight, or is it?

41
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,500
[KITTY meows]

42
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,958
Ow! Hey! Cut it out!

43
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,791
[KUROKO] Even if he
does know something,

44
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,291
I told myself I
was going to wait.

45
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,666
[KAMIJO] Calm down!
It's all right.

46
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,500
Put the claws away!

47
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,791
So, your name's Kamijo?

48
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,250
Oh, whoops.

49
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,458
I guess I have the
wrong room, I'm sorry!

50
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,333
[KUROKO] No, no,
you are not mistaken.

51
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,458
You came here looking
for Sissy, correct?

52
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,416
I live here with her.
I'm Sissy's roommate.

53
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,375
Oh, okay. Hello then.

54
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,791
I take it Misaka's not home.

55
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,041
[KUROKO] She's not.

56
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,583
However, I am expecting
her at any moment now.

57
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,541
If you have something
pressing to discuss with her,

58
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,791
I recommend you
come in and wait.

59
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,958
Oh. are you sure?

60
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,500
[KUROKO] That would
be the best idea

61
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,083
if you do not wish to miss her.

62
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,750
Besides, when curfew hits, the
dorm security will be activated,

63
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,000
and you will no longer be
able to wait in the lobby.

64
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,500
[knocking]

65
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,666
[KUROKO] Come in.

66
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,500
Really, go ahead.
The door is not locked.

67
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,250
You can open it from out there.

68
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,791
Um, maybe I should--

69
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,083
[KUROKO] Don't just stand there.

70
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,125
Come into the room, and
close the door please.

71
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,833
[KAMIJO] Uh, oh, right.

72
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,166
[KUROKO] I apologize.

73
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,958
This room is primarily
intended for sleeping in.

74
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,083
I'm afraid it does not
offer much in the way of

75
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,541
entertainment for guests.

76
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,083
There is no telling how long
you'll be waiting for her.

77
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,333
You might as well have
a seat over on the bed.

78
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,916
[KAMIJO] Uh, no thank you.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,541
I don't think I could do that.
Not without her permission.

80
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,166
[KUROKO] Then you have
no reason to worry.

81
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,333
That one there's
actually my bed.

82
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,625
Huh? What are you doing
on somebody else's bed?

83
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,000
Are you some kind of pervert?

84
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,541
That's really creepy.

85
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,083
You're here at an all-girls
dorm and you call me a pervert?

86
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,708
Everyone has their own
secret, special habits.

87
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,458
They may seem strange
to other people,

88
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,666
but that doesn't make them
wrong or perverted at all.

89
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,791
Like you never secretly
pressed your lips

90
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,041
to your
crush's picture.

91
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,250
or stole the seat from
her bicycle to caress.

92
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,083
No, I haven't!

93
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,666
Shh!

94
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,208
It would be best if you avoided
raising your voice so loudly.

95
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,750
Things will turn ugly if
anybody outside hears you.

96
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,708
Yeah, okay.

97
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,750
[KAMIJO] Hey, you know,
if you guys share a room,

98
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,916
doesn't that make the
two of you classmates?

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,750
"Sissy" sounds more like a
nickname for an upperclassman.

100
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,750
Well sure. She is
older than I am.

101
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,833
In fact, I'm actually
a full year behind her.

102
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,458
I saw to it that her previous
roommate was reassigned

103
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,708
and then I took her place.

104
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,875
And it was all totally
legal of course.

105
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,125
Uhh...

106
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,916
Anyway, what business
do you have with Sissy

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,208
that brings you here so late?

108
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,041
[KUROKO]
Just a moment!

109
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,125
On second thought,
you need not tell me.

110
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,083
I have already resolved not
to act on any information

111
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,500
I may acquire.

112
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,416

[KUROKO gasps]

114
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,166
Hey! Did you hear that?
It sounds like a patrol!

115
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,541
If the head resident finds
you here in this room,

116
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,833
it's going to mean big
trouble for both of us!

117
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,083
[KAMIJO] Who's that?

118
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,875
A dangerous, intrusive
person who likes to do

119
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,875
room inspections
without prior warning.

120
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,125
There's no choice.

121
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,291
I have to send you
outside until she's gone.

122
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,416
Huh? I don't get it.

123

Why isn't my power working?

Well, here's the thing.

125

[KUROKO] We have no time!

126
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,333
Get down there!

127
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,708
You just have to hide
underneath the bed!

128
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,083

Yes, she is.

You see, lately she hasn't
been sleeping well at night.

She's catching up
on her rest now.

I would hate for
these mysterious noises

140
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,041
to disturb her.

find what's causing them?

10032. Date: August the 21st.

175
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,416
Time: twenty-thirty hours.

176
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
[KAMIJO gasps]

177
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,125
Honestly.

178
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,416
Huh?

179
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,791
Stupid monkey!

180
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:03,708
What, did he climb out?
This isn't a jungle!

181
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,791
After all that.

182
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,583
I didn't get to
ask him anything.

183
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,416
[KAMIJO] She knew.

184
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,791
She knew about this.

185
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,041
[MIKOTO] Of all places.

186
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,541
[KAMIJO] She knows about the
existence of the clones.

187
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,666
[MIKOTO] Stupid things.

188
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,333
I really can't
stand those blimps.

189
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,208
[KAMIJO] Huh?

190
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,375
What's wrong with them?

191
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,000
[MIKOTO] They're nothing
but big computers.

192
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,625
Programmed to control us.

193
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,375
[KAMIJO] The experiments.

194
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,458
This whole project!

195
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,166
[KAMIJO] There isn't any wind.

196
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,791
It's her!

197
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,750
How could they?

198
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,375
How could they do it?

199
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,666
Why did it turn out like this?

200
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,875
Now here I am.

201
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,875
There's only one more thing
I can think of to try.

202
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,666
And, if this plan
fails them, too...

203
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,875
Then...

204
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,291
[MIKOTO sobs]

205
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,750
Please, help.

206
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,125
Somebody, help.

207
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,041
[KITTY meows]

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,458
[KITTY meows]

209
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,791
It's a cat.

210
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:37,583
[footsteps]

211
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:44,500
[MIKOTO breathes heavily]

212
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,333
What do you think
you're doing?

213
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,166
Answer me.

214
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,958
[MIKOTO] What's it to you?

215
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,416
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want.

216
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,958
You're out here, too.

217
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,041
So why don't you just mind your
own business and leave me--

218
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,166
[KAMIJO] Cut the crap.

219
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,875
What's the deal with
you tonight? I'm just--

220
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,833
I read all about
the project.

221
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,583
About all of
your Sisters.

222
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,750
The experiments
and everything.

223
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,083
So like I said,
let's cut the crap.

224
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,833
[MIKOTO] That paper.
How did you?

225
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,416
[MIKOTO] Impossible! He knows!

226
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,125
Heh.

227
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,458
Well, well, well.

228
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,958
Just who are
you, anyway?

229
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,750
You only met my
clone yesterday,

230
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,833
and you already got your hands
on this top-secret information.

231
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,000
You could
be a detective.

232
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,958
[MIKOTO] A guy like this
I can already tell.

233
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,125
He is not going to
approve of my plan.

234
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,791
The very fact that you're
holding that file means

235
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,375
you've been in my room
without my permission.

236
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,458
[MIKOTO] As far as he knows,

237
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,541
I'm a participant
in the experiment

238
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,500
who volunteered
her DNA.

239
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,166
He's probably come
here to condemn me.

240
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,000
Not only that, but you looked
inside of my stuffed bear.

241
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,291
Normally I'd kill
someone for that.

242
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,500
[MIKOTO] Oh, well.

243
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,916
He may not have all the facts,

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,958
but the outcome's
the same, anyway.

245
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,791
I blame myself.

246
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,916
Why shouldn't there be
somebody else blaming me, too?

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,041
So, why are you here?

248
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:17,541
Did you come to tell me how
disgusted you are with me?

249
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,416
[KAMIJO sighs]

250
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,875
[KAMIJO] That's what you think?

251
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,750
I'm here 'cause
I'm concerned.

252
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,875
[MIKOTO] You know, it's kinda
nice to hear someone say that.

253
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,375
Even if it isn't the truth.

254
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,625
[KAMIJO] It is the truth.

255
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,958
[KAMIJO] I mean
what I say!

256
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,458
[MIKOTO sobs]

257
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,416
[siren blares]

258
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,041
[MIKOTO] You know
what the Sisters say?

259
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,500
They compare themselves
to laboratory animals

260
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,291
without so much as
batting an eye.

261
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,375
Like rats or guinea pigs.

262
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,583
Their bodies are messed around
with for the sake of research.

263
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,916
and when they're
used up, that's that.

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,500
They aren't stupid.

265
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,416
They know exactly what it means
to be some scientist's lab rat.

266
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,250
They know, and still...

267
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,125
That's what they refer
to themselves as.

268
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,791
They're in this situation
because of me.

269
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:37,958
It's my fault.

270
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,583
And that makes it my duty

271
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,750
to make sure the ones
who are left survive.

272
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,250
Where are
you going now?

273
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,000
There's another experiment
being held tonight.

274
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,708
Before it begins, I'm going
to track down Accelerator

275
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,166
and fight him with every
ounce of strength in my body.

276
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,250
Can you defeat him?

277
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,208
I have the file.

278
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,666
Do you know what
Tree Diagram predicts?

279
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,416
That you'll be dead
in 185 moves.

280
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,000
You can fight, but do you
really think you'll win?

281
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,250
[MIKOTO] You're right.

282
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,333
It doesn't really matter
what I try against him,

283
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,583
There's no way that I can
win in a fair fight.

284
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:23,625
However, what if I'm even worse
than they expect me to be?

285
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,458
If, for example, I lost the
fight after the first move.

286
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,333
The prediction that
I'd lose after 185 moves

287
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,791
would be proved wrong.

288
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,541
Maybe the researchers
would see that

289
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,583
and begin to doubt
the whole project.

290
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,916
Maybe they'd be forced to
reconsider the simulations.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,500
So, by losing to him.

292
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,125
I could actually
make myself useful.

293
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,916
So that's it.

294
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,625
You plan to die.

295
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,041
And you're convinced
that, if you die

296
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,416
the entire project will
come crashing to a halt?

297
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,583
[MIKOTO] Yeah.

298
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,083
As far as the researchers
are concerned.

299
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,750
Tree Diagram's
projections are absolute.

300
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,625
But, if I was to be
unceremoniously beaten

301
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,083
on the very first move, lying
there, helpless and pathetic.

302
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,625
Surely there's only one
thing they could think.

303
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,625
That something must've
been wrong with

304
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,041
Tree Diagram's original
programming. They'll stop.

305
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,125
[KAMIJO] Wouldn't they just
do some recalculations

306
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,583
and start back up again?

307
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,250
[MIKOTO]
They wouldn't be able to.

308
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,541
The Tree Diagram satellite
was actually attacked

309
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,083
from the ground and brought
down a few weeks back.

310
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,916
There won't be
any recalculations.

311
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,916
Well then.

312
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,750
you've got it all
planned out, huh?

313
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,375
And now you
know everything.

314
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,666
So, will you
step aside?

315
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,916
No way.

316
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,708
I know you've convinced
yourself you're doing

317
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,125
the right thing here.

318
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,041
But I'm not gonna let you
just march off to your death.

319
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,083
[MIKOTO] Oh, really?

320
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,666
Are you saying you have some
other solution to offer?

321
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,250
Yeah, I didn't
think so.

322
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,500
Now take your
idealism and stuff it.

323
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,666
I don't have
time for this.

324
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,500
Say what you want.
I'm not moving.

325
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,791
This isn't getting
us anywhere.

326
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,500
[MIKOTO] What, are you
so heartless you think

327
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,208
since they're just
a bunch of clones,

328
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,833
it's no big deal if they die?

329
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,250
If you're not going to move,

330
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,166
I'll happily shoot
right through you.

331
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,083
Unless you want that,
step aside!

332
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,291
So, you want to settle
this by force, do you?

333
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,958
How many times have
I tried to fry you now?

334
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:24,041
I'm still not sure what kind
of power you used against me.

335
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,750
But I do know I can't
afford to lose to you today!

336
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,875
So you better be ready
to fight for your life

337
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,333
because if you don't,

338
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,833
you will die!

339
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,708
What do you think
you're doing?

340
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,083
[KAMIJO] Just standing.

341
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,666
I'm not going to fight you.

342
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,750
What?

343
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,041
I won't fight you!

344
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,625
Huh?

345
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,208
You can stop playing
the noble idiot now!

346
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,833
Do you think I'm
going to stand aside

347
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,416
just because you
put your hands up?

348
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,416
I can't take any other
route than this.

349
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,625
I'm not bluffing.

350
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,250
I'll fry the life out
of you if I have to!

351
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,625
Well go ahead, then.

352
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,791
I won't fight.

353
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,000
[MIKOTO] Damn it!

354
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,041
If you want to stop me,
then fight like a man!

355
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,750
If you don't want to fight, then
get the hell out of my way!

356
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,083
But don't just
stand there calmly

357
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,541
while you ruin all my plans!

358
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,000
This is the last time
I'm gonna say it.

359
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,666
Fight me!

360
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,541
[MIKOTO] No way.

361
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,958
I've never been able to land an
attack on him like that before.

362
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,708
It didn't feel like it was
negated like the other times.

363
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,250
It felt like it
went through him.

364
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,125
[KAMIJO groans]

365
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,208
[MIKOTO] Do you understand now?

366
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,125
I'll do it. I will hurt you.

367
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,458
[MIKOTO]
What're you?

368
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,083
[KAMIJO]
I already said.

369
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,083
I refuse to fight you.

370
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,500
I don't get it!

371
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,291
You know these experiments
are wrong, don't you?

372
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,416
I'm trying to put
a stop to them!

373
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,166
Why are you
doing this?

374
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,791
Yeah. I know they're wrong.

375
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,666
What they're doing is crazy.

376
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,166
Evil and disgusting.

377
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,416
[MIKOTO]
Then why are--

378
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,541
[KAMIJO] But, the way
you've got it planned.

379
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,416
You are going to die tonight.

380
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,541
So I...

381
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,958
...won't move.

382
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,833
[MIKOTO] Shut up, you fool.

383
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,416
You're an idiot.

384
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,750
Saying nice things,
trying to reassure me.

385
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,750
Well, I promise
I don't deserve it.

386
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,916
You know what?

387
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,791
Maybe you live in a
world that's full of

388
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,458
happy endings for everybody!

389
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,750
Well, sorry, in a world like
that, there's no place for me!

390
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,500
Say you die and your
Sisters all survive.

391
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,833
Do you really think
they'll be grateful to you?

392
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,041
You must have
realized it.

393
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,416
Do things your way, and
you won't save anybody.

394
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,000
[KAMIJO winces]

395
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,750
[MIKOTO] You don't know
what you're talking about.

396
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,708
If I die tonight.

397
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,791
That means ten thousand
Sisters get to live.

398
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:22,125
Really it's not even a
difficult decision to make.

399
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,875
If my one life can save
ten thousand of theirs,

400
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,875
that's a good thing isn't it?

401
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,208
It's not much, but
maybe it's enough?

402
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,916
So please, just go.

403
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,625
I'm not moving.

404
00:19:55,291 --> 00:20:01,541
[MIKOTO sobs]

405
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:06,041
[KITTY meows]

406
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,625
[KITTY meows]

407
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,791
You're really a complete
idiot, aren't you?

408
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,375
This doesn't have
anything to do with you.

409
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,333
You could easily have
turned a blind eye

410
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,458
and pretended that
you knew nothing.

411
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,208
You could have just continued
living your normal life.

412
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,541
[KAMIJO groans]

413
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,750
[MIKOTO] Why would you put
yourself through this?

414
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,458
You look like hell.

415
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,041
I think your heart may even have
stopped for a second there.

416
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,125
[KAMIJO chuckles]

417
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,583
How can you smile like that

418
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,208
after everything
that's happened?

419
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:04,625
I was just thinking,
"I'm glad I'm on her side."

420
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,791
Now, come on.

421
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,875
Stop crying.

422
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,833
[KAMIJO] I've got an idea.

423
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,291
A way to force them to stop.

424
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,791
Think about it.

425
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,833
The experiment's based
on the supposition

426
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,916
that Accelerator's
the strongest esper.

427
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,291
Well, what if he's proven
to be incredibly weak?

428
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,583
For instance.

429
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,375
Let's say he was
handily defeated

430
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,250
in a fight with a Level 0.

431
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:43,083
The experiment's basic
premise would be flawed.

432
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,958
What are you saying?

433
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,125
You don't mean--

434
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,708
[KAMIJO] That's right.

435
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,458
I'll fight him.

436
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,833
[MIKOTO] That's impossible!

437
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,250
We're talking about a guy
so strong and arrogant

438
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,500
he wouldn't even break a sweat
if he had to defend himself

439
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,083
from an entire army!

440
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,708
He'd kill you for sure!

441
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,166
[MIKOTO] Mama isn't
here now to make

442
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,125
every little problem go away.

443
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,458
[MIKOTO] Don't do this!

444
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,458
I can't drag anybody else
into this mess with me!

445
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,416
The cost has already
been too great!

446
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,041
[MIKOTO] Santa stopped making
house calls a long time ago.

447
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,250
[MIKOTO] Don't you see?

448
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,166
This is something I
have to do on my own!

449
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:14,875
Please let me!

450
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,541
[KAMIJO] How about this.

451
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,708
Work with me.

452
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,916
I know you have
your own goals.

453
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,875
Mine is seeing everybody
get through this alive.

454
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,708
So, let's work together.

455
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,041
Maybe we'll both win.

456
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,000
[MIKOTO] All that
is wishful thinking.

457
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,583
It's not like some hero is going
to come dashing to the rescue.

458
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,083
Just let me go.

459
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,708
I'll stop the experiment
and bring your sister back.

460
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,125
That's a promise, okay?

461
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:48,125
[MIKOTO sobs]

462
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,916
[KAMIJO] It's starting soon.
I have to hurry.

463
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,625
[MIKOTO] Here, kitty.

464
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,500
[KITTY purrs]

465
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,875
Good boy.

466
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,166
[KITTY meows]

467
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,708
[KAMIJO] I don't know if I
have any chance of beating him,

468
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,958
but I have to try.
For their sake.

469
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,250
For her sake.

470
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,416
I'm going to do whatever
I have to, to stop this!
