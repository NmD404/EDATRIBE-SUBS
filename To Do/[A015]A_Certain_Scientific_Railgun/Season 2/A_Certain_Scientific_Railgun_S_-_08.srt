1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,625
[SUIT MAN 8-A] Confirm.

2
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,500
It's three minutes past
the rendevous time.

3
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,041
[SUIT MAN 8-B] This is Point A.

4
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,333
Confirmed, there's
no one in sight yet.

5
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,625
[SUIT MAN 8-C] All right...
So they're no-shows.

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,500
Guess they realized they were
messing with the wrong people.

7
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,625
[MUGINO] Now you're
just being ridiculous.

8
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,416
[SUIT MAN 8-A]
Hey! Who was that?

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,666
[MUGINO] I'm here,
as we agreed...

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,416
Closer than you know, in fact.

11
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,125
[SUIT MAN 8-B] 
The deal is off... It's off.

12
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,250
Get out of there right now!

13
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,500
Who are you?

14
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,208
[FRENDA] Heh.

15
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,625
[SUIT MAN 8-B] Ahh!

16
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,041
You! Stay back!

17
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,791
[KINUHATA sighs]

18
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,666
[SUIT MAN 8-A screams]

19
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,666
[MUGINO] What's that? Again?

20
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,583
Yeah... Yeah, all right...

21
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,875
Fine. So who is it?

22
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,791
Pharmaceuticals? Really?

23
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:41,625
Isn't that a little...

24
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,958
[FRENDA] Sure, that's true.

25
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,333
It's not like I don't
see what you're saying...

26
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,583
but, all told...

27
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,083
the whole point of a swimsuit

28
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,125
is to show off your
body to other people...

29
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,791
so going to a private pool

30
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,833
defeats the purpose of wearing
one, if you see what I mean.

31
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,000
[KINUHATA] Okay.

32
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,416
But all of the public
pools and beaches

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,958
are always ultra crowded...

34
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:01,041
There's no room, so it's
next to impossible to swim.

35
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,625
[FRENDA] Yeah...
I guess you're right.

36
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,458
I hadn't thought about that.

37
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,291
What do you think,
Takitsubo?

38
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,916
[TAKITSUBO] Hmm...

39
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,625
As long there's space to
just float like a corpse,

40
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,708
it doesn't
matter to me.

41
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,125
Oh... Okay...

42
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,416
[clapping]

43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,125
Ladies, let's cut the chit chat
while we're working.

44
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,791
Kinuhata, that's enough...

45
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,625
We've got a new request,
so we're heading back.

46
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,041
What time?

47
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,250
[MUGINO] Good question.
The request is somewhat vague.

48
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:29,958
Huh?

49
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,166
That said...

50
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,291
our task sounds like
it'll be simple enough.

51
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,958
Hey... I don't know
how much I like

52
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,541
taking on a job
that's so vague...

53
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,416
But, all told, Mugino,
you're the boss, so whatever.

54
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000
So, what is the job?

55
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,541
Protecting a facility from
a mysterious invader...

56
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,291
The pay isn't too bad, either...

57
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,333
I think this is perfect.

58
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,166
Just the kind of job we here
at ITEM like to take on.

59
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,458
[MUGINO] An esper with the power
to control electricity, huh?

60
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,833
[FEMALE VOICE 8-A] The attacks
have been conducted

61
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,333
via communications lines,

62
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,166
and no intruder has been
caught by electronic security,

63
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,958
so that's their guess.

64
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,208
Actually... the client
seems to have this

65
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,500
rather narrowly
profiled already.

66
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,416
So they've got a
suspect in mind?

67
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,958
In that case, why don't they
set up their own counterattack?

68
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,083
I think that it would be
ultra easy to stage an ambush.

69
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,333
[FEMALE VOICE 8-A]
You are only to act

70
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,333
once the target is
within the facility...

71
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,625
and you are not to pry
into the particulars...

72
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,250
those are the client's orders.

73
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,916
Uh? What's with these guys?

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,500
I don't like how this
job is going so far.

75
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,708
[FEMALE VOICE 8-A]
What do you want?

76
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,916
A job's a job.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,833
We don't take them
because they're fun...

78
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,250
Anyway... they sought
you out for this gig...

79
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sure they had
their reasons...

80
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,750
Now quit your whining
and get to work!

81
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,625
[FRENDA] Okay.

82
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,875
So that's the job...

83
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,625
just lie in wait then
take out the opponent?

84
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,791
[MUGINO] Basically.

85
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,291
With one catch, though...

86
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,625
There are two facilities
that our mystery attacker

87
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,916
could potentially target.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,291
Ooh! I can cover one
of them by myself!

89
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,041
[MUGINO] Huh?

90
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,416
What's with you?

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,291
I thought you didn't
like this job.

92
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,458
[FRENDA] Liking the job
has nothing to do with it...

93
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,041
I mean if I'm the one
to take 'em out,

94
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,083
then I earn the kill shot
bonus, don't I?

95
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,666
[MUGINO chuckles]

96
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,750
[MUGINO] All right, Frenda...

97
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,958
Just make sure you
stay in contact.

98
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,416
Don't get in over
your head, okay?

99
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:50,000
[horn honks]

100
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,250
[MIKOTO] Only two places left.

101
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,166
Including this one.

102
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,625
[MIKOTO] At this point,

103
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't know how far they've
gone with the experiment.

104
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,583
And I don't think
I want to know.

105
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,541
But either way.

106
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,708
It ends tonight.

107
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,875
[FRENDA] I volunteered for this

108
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,791
'cause the pay
was so enticing...

109
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,541
but waiting around for somebody
who may not even show up

110
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,500
certainly is boring...

111
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,083
All told, this really sucks.

112
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,000
And if they go to
the other facility

113
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,291
while I'm stuck here
waiting at this one...

114
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,916
then all these tedious
minutes of utter boredom

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,083
will have been for nothing!

116
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,375
[creaking]

117
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,291
No way!

118
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,291
The target's actually here!

119
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,541
[FRENDA]
Well, I'm ready...

120
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,416
Time to earn that
kill shot bonus.

121
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,208
[MIKOTO] All right.

122
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,625
The research facility I'm
after is on the top floor.

123
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,583
If I get lucky...

124
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,875
maybe I can pull this
off without a hitch.

125
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,083
Of course not.

126
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,041
Like it would ever
actually be that easy.

127
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,875
[FRENDA] Not a single
one hit her?

128
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,125
Did she use magnetism to
divert the stone's path?

129
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:31,458
It looks like the intel about
an electrical esper was right.

130
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,333
There we go...

131
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:38,208
Ordinarily, this is a tool used
to burn through walls and doors,

132
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,750
but tonight...

133
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,500
[MIKOTO] A bomb?

134
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,583
What kind of
scientists are these?

135
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,375
Putting bombs inside
of stuffed animals?

136
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,875
[MIKOTO] They're igniting
the bombs using fuses

137
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,541
they set up in the room
ahead of time...

138
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,041
I don't get it.

139
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,541
Why would they want to make
this such a big production?

140
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,916
Wha--? A bomb in the rubble?

141
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,000
[MIKOTO] They're
predicting my moves.

142
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,708
Does that mean they know
they're being attacked

143
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,833
by an Electromaster?

144
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,125
[MIKOTO groans]

145
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,791
[MIKOTO] I was hoping not to
use my maximum magnetism...

146
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,666
It does a lot of damage.

147
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,375
Never mind that...
Where are they?

148
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,208
More of those fuses?

149
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,958
Maybe if I follow
where they lead...

150
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,916
She's the one, huh?

151
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,250
[MALE RESEARCHER 8-A]
Are you sure?

152
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,666
Yes... I heard it was
pathological analysis.

153
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,500
Word is they're
the ones who got hit.

154
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,666
What a relief.

155
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,083
That should buy us some time...

156
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,625
Still, we need to
hurry up with our move.

157
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,208
[MALE SUBORDINATE 8-A]
Excuse me...

158
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,583
[MALE RESEARCHER 8-A]
What is it?

159
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,791
[MALE SUBORDINATE 8-A]
Well, uh...

160
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,708
There's a visitor.

161
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,791
[foot steps]

162
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,916
[MALE RESEARCHER 8-A] Hello.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,208
I'm sorry if I've
kept you waiting...

164
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,625
It's nice to meet you...

165
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,166
Uh... please forgive
me, but you are...?

166
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,208
I'm the one who was in
charge of your company's

167
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,458
Testament oversight.

168
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,291
My name's Nunotaba.

169
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,208
[FRENDA] Almost!

170
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,291
That stupid girder
is in my way.

171
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,416
[MIKOTO] I don't want any
more interference later on.

172
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,833
I'll deal with her now.

173
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,250
[FRENDA] She's put up
quite a fight so far...

174
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,875
Chances are if I'd used
my remote-control bombs,

175
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,333
she'd be dead by now.

176
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,916
But with an Electromaster
of her level, it's possible

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,958
she could've taken control
of them, instead.

178
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,208
All told... it was
the right decision.

179
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,541
And... boom!

180
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,416
[FRENDA] No way!

181
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,750
She can deflect ceramic bombs?

182
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,833
She's on an entirely
different level

183
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,833
than any other esper
I've gone up against.

184
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,416
[MIKOTO] You won't get away...

185
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,708
I don't know if you're directly
involved or just a hired goon.

186
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,375
But anyone who supports
this experiment...

187
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,708
...will pay!

188
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,583
Oh, dear!
I'm terrified!

189
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,125
Just look at her!

190
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,625
If she catches me, she'll tear
me into tiny little pieces!

191
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:54,166
Heh. Yeah, as if!

192
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,250
[FRENDA laughs]

193
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,000
I lured her up as
high as I could,

194
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,083
so that was quite
a fall she took.

195
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,833
It doesn't matter how high-level
an esper you are after...

196
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,166
...that?

197
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,958
No. That's impossible.

198
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,916
If you were wanting
to see me fall,

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,166
you should've fought me
in a different building.

200
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,416
One that wasn't built using
any steel, for example.

201
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,458
You should be gone! No fair!

202
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,666
Oh!

203
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,916
Looks like you've
hit a dead end.

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,500
[FRENDA] It does, huh?

205
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,416
I never expected to be backed
into a corner like this.

206
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,541
[MIKOTO] It happens.

207
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,208
It is a pretty easy
mistake to make...

208
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,083
Perhaps you were panicking and
took a wrong turn somewhere...

209
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,625
Or maybe...

210
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,625
[FRENDA] Heh.

211
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,416
What do you think?

212
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,875
[MALE RESEARCHER 8-A] Oh, I'm
sorry if it wasn't clear...

213
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,750
There isn't really anything
specific we need from you.

214
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,750
It's just, this is the
first time we've done

215
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,416
a large-scale move like this...

216
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
so I thought, you know, if
anything were to happen...

217
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,333
it would be good to
have you around...

218
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,208
given your previous
involvement with the project.

219
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,916
[NUNOTABA] Of course.
I understand.

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,791
Thank you, I thought
that you might...

221
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,291
Well, then, if you'll
excuse me for a moment.

222
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,250
[door closes]

223
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,208
[MIKOTO] There's something
I want to ask you,

224
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,500
while I still can.

225
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,833
It's a simple question...
Who hired you?

226
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,166
[FRENDA] Huh?

227
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,875
Now isn't the time to be
concerned about loyalty...

228
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,083
This facility is part
of a cruel experiment--

229
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,750
[FRENDA] Yeah, yeah,
never mind about all that.

230
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,958
My employer's background,
their objectives,

231
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,875
the morality of the person
I've been hired to eliminate...

232
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,833
the possibility that they're
fighting for a noble cause...

233
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,375
All told, those
sorts of things...

234
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,958
Just don't really
matter to me.

235
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,208
Do you understand
your situation now?

236
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,833
Let me explain something to you,

237
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,625
you've heard those
stories before, right?

238
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,958
The ones about the hunter
becoming the hunted.

239
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,708
Take a look at where
you're standing.

240
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,625
[FRENDA]
Your retreat is cut off.

241
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,916
There's nothing to
shield your self with...

242
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,250
Now what will you do?

243
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,291
Go ahead. I'd love to see
you get out of this one!

244
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,333
Heh.

245
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,208
[MIKOTO sighs]

246
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,500
Well, so much for that...

247
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,625
You try to end things
in a civilized way,

248
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,125
and look what happens.

249
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,375
[FRENDA gasps]

250
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,833
[MIKOTO] My work's not over.

251
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,291
I need to save as much
of my strength as I can.

252
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,000
[FRENDA] She actually
lifted up the floor!

253
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,916
Oh no... Does that mean...

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,583
Am I fighting a Level 5 esper?

255
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,875
I'm done with you!

256
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,125
[FRENDA] Then again,
people with too much power

257
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,708
do have a tendency
to be careless.

258
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,083
[MIKOTO] Uh-oh!

259
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,291
That's what you get for making
your next move so obvious.

260
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,875
[MIKOTO grunts]

261
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,250
[MIKOTO] A stun grenade!

262
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,750
Serves me right... I got sloppy.

263
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,458
[FRENDA laughs]

264
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,000
[FRENDA] I love seeing a
cocky, powerful esper like that

265
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,458
trapped by my own hands...

266
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,625
It makes me feel all
warm and fuzzy inside!

267
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,000
[FRENDA laughs]

268
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:53,958
All told, messing with me can
be hazardous to your health!

269
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,333
All right! That's
half the paycheck!

270
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,666
Half the money for
this gig goes to me!

271
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,041
Money for me! Money for me!

272
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,916
I'm so excited! I wonder
what I should buy...

273
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,333
She's gone?

274
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,166
That wasn't enough firepower
to incinerate her.

275
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,250
So... I guess...

276
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,208
if she's not there,
she must be...

277
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,541
[MIKOTO] I'll give you
this much, at least.

278
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,833
You've done your homework
on Electromasters.

279
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,000
But I'm at a slightly
higher level...

280
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,000
EM waves provide me
with a picture

281
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,416
of the surrounding space.

282
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,416
Whoa, there!

283
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,625
Best not to make
any sudden moves.

284
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,250
I'm starting to get my sight
and my hearing back...

285
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,625
And at such a close range,

286
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,083
nothing can outrun
my electric shocks.

287
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,458
Uh... Mijihi!

288
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,666
Huh?

289
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,000
Miji... cavi... capri...

290
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,125
[MIKOTO] Huh?
What is she saying?

291
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,041
I've never heard a
language like that...

292
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,916
Hold on... one of those
words could have been...

293
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,958
It's gibberish... Gotcha!

294
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,250
Hah!

295
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,166
[MIKOTO] Another bomb?

296
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,916
When will she give up?

297
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,625
[MIKOTO] What is that?

298
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,625
[FRENDA] Academy City's
specially-made

299
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,041
gaseous explosive.

300
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,708
They call it Ignus.

301
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,833
It won't do you any
harm to breathe it in...

302
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,666
but then, it's an explosive,
not a poison.

303
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,625
The way it's filling
the air now...

304
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,291
It's turning this room
into one big bomb.

305
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,708
So...

306
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,416
do you know what would happen
if you used electricity?

307
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,333
Well... I think I'll kill
you now nice... and slow!

308
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:29,916
[MIKOTO] Not good.

309
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,625
Electricity is out
of the question,

310
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,041
and using magnetism runs the
risk of creating friction.

311
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:42,916
Ah!

312
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,750
[MIKOTO] Is this girl a psycho?

313
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,166
It's not impossible that all the
stomping around she's doing

314
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,875
could kick up a spark.

315
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,708
[FRENDA] I can tell
you're wondering

316
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,166
if I have a death wish.

317
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,125
In case you haven't noticed,
I work for the underworld.

318
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,500
You think I can do that and
still be afraid of dying?

319
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,958
[FRENDA] Yeah, right!

320
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,708
I couldn't be more full of it!

321
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,000
There's no way I'm
dying in here with you.

322
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,958
The canister I tossed first was
the real thing, all right...

323
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,916
but what I dispersed afterward
was just ordinary nitrogen.

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,333
I didn't think she would fall
for it so completely, though.

325
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,375
[MALE RESEARCHER 8-A]
So, what's the deal

326
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,083
with the underworld cleaner
they've got standing by?

327
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,583
[MALE RESEARCHER 8-B]
Oh, nothing much...

328
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,166
I don't know what
she can do, really.

329
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,708
She's only a little girl.

330
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,041
Never mind her.

331
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,625
I wonder what's happening
at the other facility.

332
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,125
Who knows?

333
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,208
Any means of
external communication

334
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,666
have been disabled.

335
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,625
I just want to hurry and
get this move over with.

336
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,250
But if something
were to go wrong.

337
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,625
Well, that's why we
called in a patsy, right?

338
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,125
So somebody else can
take the responsibility.

339
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,291
Yeah,
there is that.

340
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,708
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Nunotaba--

341
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,541
Where is she?

342
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,625
[MALE RESEARCHER 8-A]
Restroom, maybe?

343
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,833
[NUNOTABA] Moving the Sisters
that are being adjusted

344
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,000
would normally come last.

345
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,750
With the abrupt
transfer of control

346
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,208
and the watch out for attackers,

347
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,666
they've ignored
internal security.

348
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,375
If I'm really going
to do this...

349
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,333
it's now or never.

350
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,875
[FRENDA] You're hanging
in there pretty well.

351
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,958
But if I don't finish
you off pretty soon,

352
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,750
Mugino and the others
will show up,

353
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,166
and I don't like to
share with others.

354
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,291
I told you before that
I don't care much

355
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,708
about my targets' lives...

356
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,791
I do care about their
deaths, however,

357
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,333
and I'm especially
interested in yours.

358
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,875
When I take a life...

359
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,916
it's an exquisite feeling.

360
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,375
Because in that moment,

361
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,125
I am in complete control of
someone else's destiny...

362
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,291
It feels great... that power...

363
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,375
As if the only reason
that person was born...

364
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,375
was to have their
life ended by me.

365
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,041
[MIKOTO gasps]

366
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,625
[FRENDA] Now, enough talk.

367
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:17,500
All told, I just want to hear
one good, final scream from you.

368
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,625
[MIKOTO] To be born for the sole
reason of being murdered...

369
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,041
To accept that...

370
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,708
to take life for granted...

371
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,291
never trying to escape...

372
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,916
or attempting to fight it...

373
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,916
never seeking to be saved ...

374
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,916
from such a
godforsaken destiny...

375
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,833
I say to hell with that!

376
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,333
[FRENDA] Oh no.

377
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,583
A choke hold...

378
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,666
Shocks aren't her
only line of defense.

379
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,333
Can't breathe!

380
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,750
[FRENDA yells]

381
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,208
[FRENDA coughs]

382
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,791
Not a bad idea.
You almost had me, but--

383
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,875
Huh?

384
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,708
[FRENDA] That was a
really close call...

385
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,291
I can't believe I almost
blew half my body off

386
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,958
with my own explosives!

387
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,041
Just imagine...

388
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,166
My beautiful legs
would have been--

389
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,791
[MIKOTO] 
Okay, I see...

390
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,333
so that's how it is...

391
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,708
It was a trick...

392
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,708
You didn't fill the room
with explosive gas, did you?

393
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,083
All told, I fell
for a simple bluff.

394
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,125
[FRENDA] Well... uh... I...

395
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,458
[MIKOTO laughs]

396
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,375
Man... "I said "All told,"

397
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,916
You're rubbing off on me...

398
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
[MIKOTO laughs]

399
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:43,208
[FRENDA laughs]

400
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,583
Tee-hee!

401
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,916
[FRENDA yells]

402
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,416
[FRENDA groans]

403
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,041
[MIKOTO] You seem like a pretty
terrible person to me...

404
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,916
I'm not gonna lose any sleep
if I shock you to death...

405
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,541
Just thought you should know.

406
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,041
I want all the info you
have on the project...

407
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,500
I mean every last detail.

408
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,541
Who's the one in charge?

409
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,291
Who hired you to do this?

410
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,375
[FRENDA] Yeah, Too bad
I don't know that,

411
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,041
since we go through
an intermediary.

412
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,500
Oh, I forgot...

413
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,791
You said somebody else was
on the way here, didn't you?

414
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,291
Who?

415
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,666
[FRENDA] There's no way
I'm telling you that.

416
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,458
[MIKOTO] You've got three
seconds to answer me...

417
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,750
unless you want to be
burned to a cinder.

418
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,416
Three...

419
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,083
[FRENDA] No! No!
I'll talk! I'll talk!

420
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,416
[MIKOTO] Two...

421
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,041
[FRENDA] My tongue!
That last shock must have...

422
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,333
Wait! Hold on! My tongue is
too numb to talk! Honestly!

423
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,416
Please don't kill me!

424
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,875
[MIKOTO] One...

425
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,500
[MIKOTO] Zero.

426
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:48,791
[FRENDA] Huh?

427
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,166
[MIKOTO] I see.

428
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,875
So you're not going to
sell out your friends, huh?

429
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,208
[FRENDA] No... I would,
I just can't talk.

430
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,250
All right... I can't
hold that against you.

431
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,458
[MIKOTO gasps]

432
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,708
[MUGINO] It got quiet
in here all of a sudden.

433
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:13,583
I was sure the Electromaster
had finished you off.

434
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,666
Looks like I got
here just in time.

435
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,375
Hello, Frenda.

436
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,416
[NUNOTABA] Mikoto Misaka...

437
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,000
[MIKOTO] I'm putting
an end to this.

438
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,916
[NUNOTABA] I can't let her take
them on without any help at all.

439
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,416
[MIKOTO] I'll save
the rest of them!

440
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,208
[NUNOTABA] Yes...
I'll do what I can...

441
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,458
I'll help her.
