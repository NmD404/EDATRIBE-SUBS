1
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,333
[KUROKO] It's your turn
to answer now, Sissy.

2
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,208
What would you do if
there was a clone of you

3
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,916
wandering around the city?

4
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,375
[MIKOTO]
That's a good question...

5
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,291
Honestly,
I would probably think it was

6
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,583
a little creepy and not want
to hang out with her at all.

7
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,875
You know what I mean?

8
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,250
[ACCELERATOR] That concludes
today's experiment.

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,125
[yawns]

10
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,666
[ACCELERATOR] I made
quite a mess this time.

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,958
I wonder how long it'll
take them to clean it up.

12
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,625
Eh... who cares?

13
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,166
I should stop by the store
on my way home and get so--

14
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,333
Nice.

15
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,250
[ACCELERATOR]
Awesome light show!

16
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,083
Picked up a new technique huh?

17
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,791
[ACCELERATOR] Controlling
the iron sand using magnetism.

18
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,833
I have to admit,
it's an interesting idea.

19
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,500
[MIKOTO] What? No way!

20
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,625
But unfortunately, once
you know how it's done,

21
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,708
it's no big deal anymore.

22
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,958
[MIKOTO] I threw
all that at him...

23
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
and he doesn't
even have a scratch?

24
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,833
What the...?

25
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,916
[screams]

26
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,708
Huh? That's a lot
of power. Are you...?

27
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,333
[MIKOTO] That's... impossible.

28
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,166
How could I not
know about an esper

29
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,791
who can shrug off
my attacks like that?

30
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,250
Ah, I understand now!

31
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,958
I was wondering what this was
since it wasn't on the schedule.

32
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:44,166
You... You're the Original.

33
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:47,958
[ACCELERATOR]
The clones are supposed

34
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,000
to take the Original's place.

35
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,666
But if I fight you...

36
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,458
that would considerably
reduce the number of

37
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,916
lame combat scenarios
I have to go through, right?

38
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,541
I'm really starting

39
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,666
to get tired of doing this...

40
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,833
What do you say? Original...

41
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,333
Tell me why...

42
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,541
Why are you going
along with this project?

43
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,250
Uh... Can we just fight ?

44
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,458
[MIKOTO] Answer me!

45
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,333
You've got some serious power...

46
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,458
There's no way that they
could force you to do anything!

47
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,541
So, what's your reason

48
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,875
for participating
in this insanity?

49
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,458
What could she have
done to deserve this?

50
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:37,250
Reason. What's my reason?
That's easy...

51
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,333
[ACCELERATOR] My goal is
to acquire absolute power.

52
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
[ACCELERATOR]
Not the power

53
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,333
of a Level 5, or
Academy City's top dog.

54
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,125
Nothing that insignificant.

55
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,833
[ACCELERATOR] I'm talking
about the kind of power

56
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,000
that will stop people

57
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,875
from even thinking
about challenging me.

58
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,375
I want invincibility.

59
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,416
You get that, right?
Being a Level 5.

60
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,125
[MIKOTO]
You're nuts... aren't you?

61
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,708
So you want to be invincible...

62
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,458
Is that your excuse?

63
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,500
Seriously?
Power's not enough.

64
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,583
You need absolute power?

65
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,708
[MIKOTO] That's the
reason you're giving me?

66
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,500
The reason you
agreed to kill her?

67
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,208
[ACCELERATOR]
You make it sound so dirty.

68
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,791
Stop talking like
I'm a murderer...

69
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,916
I'm fighting things
not real people.

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,708
They're manufactured
with the push of a button.

71
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,458
What are you so
worked up about?

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,166
Oh, I get it now.
I stole your thunder, huh?

73
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,916
That move was your ace in the
hole, and I just annihilated it.

74
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,583
Oh, wow...

75
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,166
Man, I knew you were
ranked lower than me,

76
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,583
but I still thought
you'd have more

77
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,458
to bring to the table
than a little electricity.

78
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:21,666
[ACCELERATOR] All right...
Now it's my turn to play...

79
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,166
You're in pretty
rough shape, though,

80
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,250
so I'm not expecting too much.

81
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,250
But at least try to keep
me entertained, okay?

82
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,291
Third-string.

83
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,875
[MISAKA 6-A] One moment, please.

84
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,625
[MISAKA 6-A] "Combat
outside of the project may

85
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,541
introduce errors into the
computational predictions. So,"

86
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,208
says Misaka,
"this should stop now."

87
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,333
[MISAKA 6-B] "Especially
since Big Sister is a Level 5.

88
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,083
[MISAKA 6-C] The skew from such
combat would be considerable.

89
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,041
[MISAKA 6-D] Rather than
shortening the scheduled time...

90
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,291
[MISAKA 6-E]
the very project itself...

91
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,958
[MISAKA 6-F] would be
at risk of being ruined.

92
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,458
[MISAKA 6-G]
Further, Misaka has,

93
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,041
[MISAKA 6-H] in anticipation
of experiments yet to come,

94
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,083
[MISAKA 6-I] received
specific programming...

95
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,333
[MISAKA 6-J]
and any alterations

96
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,708
to the project would
be very difficult,"

97
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,625
[MISAKA 6-A]
explains Misaka simply.

98
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,250
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch... yeah, yeah, all right.

99
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,250
I get it... I was just
messing around, anyway...

100
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,791
And stop talking
like that. It's creepy.

101
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,416
[ACCELERATOR]
My bad...

102
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,250
I guess I never
introduced myself, did I?

103
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,458
[MIKOTO] Not satisfied
with being the strongest...

104
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,333
You probably
figured it out by now,

105
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,041
but I'm the one looking
after your clones...

106
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,625
They're helping me
achieve invincibility.

107
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,666
[MIKOTO]
...a Level 5 who wants

108
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,125
to become something
even greater...

109
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,625
There's no doubt...
This boy is...

110
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,916
[ACCELERATOR] I should
be grateful to you, really.

111
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,166
[MIKOTO] ...the
controller of vectors...

112
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,750
the first-ranked esper
in Academy City.

113
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,625
Hello there, I'm Accelerator.

114
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,500
It's a pleasure.

115
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,208
[MISAKA 6-A] Numbers
nine-nine-nine-five

116
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,041
through one-zero-zero-zero-seven
clear the rails.

117
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,583
[MISAKA 6-B]
One-zero-zero-zero-eight--

118
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,166
[MIKOTO]
What's wrong with you?

119
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,166
[MIKOTO] It's so screwed up...

120
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,958
Why are you going
along with this project?

121
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,333
You're going to be killed...
I don't get it...

122
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,125
Why would you do this?

123
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,125
[MIKOTO] Why?
You're breathing, aren't you?

124
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,458
You have life, don't you?
Isn't that enough?

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,375
[MIKOTO] Who are you?

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,958
[MIKOTO] Just who
the hell are you?

127
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,875
What, not who...

128
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,833
Misaka is a product
created for this project...

129
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,375
Artificial bodies...
with artificial minds...

130
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,333
Laboratory animals,
with a unit price

131
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,041
of one hundred
and eighty thousand.

132
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,125
[MISAKA 6-A]
Goodbye then... Big Sister.

133
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,333
[KUROKO] Y-Yeah...
that's why I called.

134
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,958
She hasn't come
back to the dorm yet,

135
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,833
so, I thought to myself,
"Maybe she's at Saten's."

136
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,916
Is she?

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,833
She hasn't stopped
by here at all...

138
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,166
Have you tried Uiharu?
Maybe she's there.

139
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,041
[KUROKO] I heard
from Uiharu earlier...

140
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,750
Uh, I mean...
Yes, of course...

141
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,541
If she isn't at your
place or here, then...

142
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,750
Listen, Shirai...

143
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,041
I'm just going to
throw this out there...

144
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,833
She could have a
boyfriend. It's possi--

145
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,083
No she couldn't!
There's absolutely no way!

146
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,625
I'm disappointed
in you, Saten!

147
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,125
Sissy would never do
anything so improper!

148
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,083
She belongs to me!

149
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,500
To me, alone, do you understand?

150
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,833
Hey, I was only kidding!

151
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,500
Calm down. Uh, hello?

152
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,333
Are you still there?

153
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,833
[SATEN] Geez. I wonder
what that was about.

154
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,500
[DOCTOR 2-A] It's the
simplest thing in the world.

155
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,750
All you have to do is
give us your DNA map, okay?

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,958
[MIKOTO]
Don't do it!

157
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,125
They're not going to use

158
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,750
your DNA map to cure
muscular dystrophy!

159
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,208
They're going to use it
to make clones of you!

160
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,750
It'll be the basis for a
horrible experiment!

161
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,916
Say no!

162
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,666
[MIKOTO] No, wait!

163
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,541
Listen to me!
Please, just liste--

164
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,875
[MISAKA 6-K]
So that's it...

165
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,958
You were the cause
of all this, Big Sister.

166
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,250
[MISAKA 6-L] The reason
Misaka was made...

167
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,583
[MISAKA 6-M] The reason
Misaka is killed...

168
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,833
[MISAKA 6-N] All of it.

169
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,416
[MISAKA 6-K] Everything.

170
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,541
[MIKOTO] Oh, wow...
I've been here all night.

171
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,541
[NUNOTABA] Long time no see.

172
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,250
[NUNOTABA] I thought I spotted
a delinquent camping out

173
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,375
all night on this bench.

174
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,958
I know why you're here...

175
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,000
You found out about
the project, didn't you?

176
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,125
[NUNOTABA] There's no way
you can put a stop to it.

177
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,250
That's why I told you
not to get involved.

178
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,791
[MIKOTO] No, you didn't.

179
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,750
Oh, dear...
Is that right? My mistake.

180
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,791
[MIKOTO] It's wrong.

181
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,458
[MIKOTO] How can they
get away with this?

182
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,500
I don't know anything about
Level 6 or whatever...

183
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,500
but is it something they want

184
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,375
so badly they'll kill so many?

185
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,291
Everyone involved
with the experiment

186
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,458
must be completely insane.

187
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,041
[NUNOTABA]
It's not quite like that.

188
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,750
I won't deny that
there's something crazy

189
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,958
about it all, but if we're
talking about right and wrong,

190
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,125
that's another matter.

191
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,541
Suppose there was a way

192
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,333
to develop a miracle drug
that could cure cancer...

193
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,500
but doing so would
require experimental data

194
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,625
from twenty thousand
guinea pigs.

195
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,416
What would you do?

196
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,875
You would say
"we have no other choice."

197
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,375
[MIKOTO] That's
different though.

198
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,625
[NUNOTABA] Is it?
They're both alive.

199
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,333
[NUNOTABA] And, from a
researchers perspective,

200
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,791
they are essentially
the same thing.

201
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,458
The Sisters are
artificially produced

202
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,000
guinea pigs, made for the
sake of reaching Level 6...

203
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,583
Of course...

204
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,208
There are those who are in it
for their own personal gain...

205
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,083
and there are a few of them who
really do have a screw loose...

206
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,416
But across the board,

207
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,333
none of them recognize
this as being murder.

208
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,583
[NUNOTABA]
And neither, in fact, did I.

209
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,375
[MIKOTO] Wasn't that the
reason you were spreading

210
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,458
those money cards
around the city?

211
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,083
To interfere with
the experiments?

212
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,208
[NUNOTABA]
That's correct.

213
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,375
[MIKOTO] But why?
They're not even human...

214
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,041
Why would you want
to protect them? Why?

215
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,375
[NUNOTABA] As you know,
Project Radio Noise was designed

216
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,666
in order to mass
produce Level 5 espers...

217
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,833
When it was frozen, I left the
project team... but then...

218
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,333
When the Sisters were taken
over by Project Level 6 Shift...

219
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,416
I was called in once again.

220
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,041
[NUNOTABA] We started
some in-house experiments

221
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,083
and found there were
no particular problems

222
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,500
with their individual minds.

223
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,916
The Misaka Net
is in good shape.

224
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,666
It looks problem-free.

225
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,125
[NUNOTABA] Want some?

226
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,583
I'd prefer that to
having you stare at me.

227
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,833
[MISAKA 6-O] What is this?

228
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,416
[NUNOTABA] A cup of tea.

229
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,458
It should be included in
the data input by Testament.

230
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,750
Misaka's first cup of tea.

231
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,666
[MISAKA 6-O]
"It is somewhat different

232
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,708
than the information
in the Testament data,"

233
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,875
Misaka says curiously...

234
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,541
"In addition to the
flavor of the tea leaves,

235
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,666
there is a subtle sweetness
and fullness to the-- "

236
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,708
[NUNOTABA] Oh, well that would
be because it's milk tea.

237
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,958
Basically, tea with milk added
to it... It's my favorite.

238
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,416
[MISAKA 6-O] Milk tea...

239
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,583
[NUNOTABA] It's been a long
time since we've met like this.

240
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,541
Even so... you really
haven't changed much.

241
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,416
You're just like
the first "you."

242
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,416
[NUNOTABA] Eight thousand
nine hundred and eleven units

243
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,416
have been consumed so far
in in-house experiments...

244
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,750
In that time your
emotional aspects

245
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,666
haven't developed at all...

246
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,750
However, your memories
and experiences,

247
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,041
in pure data form,

248
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,375
have all been gathered
together and shared...

249
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,875
Which is done via
the Misaka Network.

250
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,333
And that means the next unit

251
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,583
will know the
flavor of milk tea...

252
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,958
It's a truly fantastic system,
the Misaka Network.

253
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,083
"Testament plays a
very significant role,

254
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,750
as well, right?"
Misaka asks, to clarify...

255
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,708
"It is through Testament that
the Misakas are programmed.

256
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,708
That's how they learn
to conceptualize feelings

257
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,333
and remember them as data." 

258
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,166
"As a result of this process...

259
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,250
the Misakas are readily able
to face the experiments,"

260
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,875
says Misaka,
expressing gratitude.

261
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,375
[NUNOTABA] It's time now.

262
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,583
[NUNOTABA] You're heading
out for external training...

263
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,333
Do you have anything
to ask before you go?

264
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,208
[MISAKA 6-O]
What is the air outside like?

265
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,791
Is it sweet? Or, perhaps, spicy?

266
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,166
[MISAKA 6-O] "I was told the
air outside is delicious,

267
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,708
so I'm curious...

268
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,791
Misaka has a preference for
things that are sweet, you see,"

269
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,791
explains Misaka shyly,
revealing her tastes.

270
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,541
Well... you'll find out
for yourself soon enough.

271
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,500
[NUNOTABA] The glare from the
sun is pretty strong today.

272
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,708
[NUNOTABA]
Pretty disappointing isn't it?

273
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,458
[MISAKA 6-O]
No. Not disappointing at all.

274
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,250
A number of aromas

275
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,541
are stimulating
my nasal cavities...

276
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,000
and slowly filling up my chest.

277
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,541
[MISAKA 6-O] An irregular
breeze blows through my hair,

278
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,541
sweeping past my body
like a gentle touch.

279
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,750
Light rays from the
sun beam down on my skin...

280
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,541
and I can feel my cheeks
taking in their heat.

281
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,125
[MISAKA 6-O]
The outside world...

282
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,791
it really is a
dazzling place, isn't it?

283
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,000
[NUNOTABA] I hate to sound
trite, but it was that simple.

284
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,166
Something changed
in that moment.

285
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,833
From then on, I could no longer
think of them as products.

286
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,958
Because she seemed so
much more human than me...

287
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,333
She saw the beauty
in the world...

288
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,708
and I could only ever see
it as a warped, ugly thing.

289
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,791
[NUNOTABA] What about you?

290
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,708
What do you think of them?

291
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,958
[MIKOTO] I'm not sure.

292
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,666
It's difficult to think
of clones as human...

293
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,041
and why should I help them

294
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,833
when they seem so ready
to accept their own deaths?

295
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,500
[MIKOTO] However,
there are still the people

296
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,791
who took my DNA map

297
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,166
and used it for
their sick experiment.

298
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,916
[MIKOTO]
Them I intend to deal with.

299
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,583
[UIHARU]
Yeah, that's what happened...

300
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,041
She called me up
out of the blue,

301
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,083
asked me about some kind of
code, and then she just--

302
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,166
Wait a minute.

303
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,166
You don't know
what's going on, either?

304
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,708
[KUROKO] Where are you, Sissy?

305
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,416
[KUROKO] Finally!

306
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,083
Where've you been, you
could have at least called me!

307
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,916
[KUROKO]
Your clothes are all torn up...

308
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,666
What happened to you?

309
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,916
[MIKOTO] Oh... well, you know...

310
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,833
Same thing as usual...

311
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm gonna go take a shower.

312
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,041
[KUROKO] Um...

313
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,125
[KUROKO]
Hold on a second!

314
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,291
[ringing phone]

315
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,750
Hello?!

316
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,875
Uiharu?

317
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,250
Oh... yes, just n--

318
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,166
I mean, late last night...

319
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,000
That's right... There's
nothing to worry about...

320
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,375
Please pass the message on
to Haru'ue... Okay, bye.

321
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,666
[ringing phone]

322
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,500
[KUROKO] Hello? Oh, Saten...

323
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,625
Yes, late last night...

324
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,583
I told you, you had
it wrong, did I not?

325
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,333
Yes... it's all fine.

326
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,583
There's no need to worry
about anything... Right.

327
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,500
[MIKOTO] Listen, Kuroko.
Do you have a minute?

328
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,416
[MIKOTO] I'm so sorry
I had all of you worried.

329
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,208
[MIKOTO] This is
my way of apologizing...

330
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,000
It's my treat,
so go ahead, enjoy!

331
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,458
[HARU'UE] This is incredible.

332
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,250
[SATEN] So, spill, Misaka.

333
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,833
Where were you?
What were you up to?

334
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,791
[MIKOTO] I wanted to do...
some stargazing.

335
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,375
--[SATEN] Um, Stargazing?
--[UIHARU] Stargazing?

336
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,750
[MIKOTO] Yep... that's right.

337
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,083
[MIKOTO] Well, you know...

338
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,291
Like every now and again,

339
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,583
when you get into a
schmaltzy kind of mood.

340
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,916
[MIKOTO]
And you just want to sit

341
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,208
on the swings in the park,
swaying back and forth,

342
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,416
humming cheesy songs to yourself
and staring at the stars...

343
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,708
You get it.

344
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,125
No, I don't...

345
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't even know what
"schmaltzy" means.

346
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,625
Oh you don't, huh?

347
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,666
Well, it's just how
I was feeling last night.

348
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,166
I meant to ask:

349
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,458
Did you ever figure out what
that code was for yesterday?

350
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,750
What do you mean?

351
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:18,583
Oh, it was just...

352
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,166
[MIKOTO] A-Ah... the code!

353
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,958
Well that was... it was...

354
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,666
[KUROKO] What is it, Sissy?

355
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,208
[UIHARU] Are you okay?

356
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,916
[SATEN] Please, Misaka,
is something wrong?

357
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,875
[MIKOTO] I can see you.

358
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,916
[MIKOTO] All of you...

359
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,166
I can see you there beside me...
but I can't... I can't...

360
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,625
What are you saying?

361
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,583
[SATEN] The arcade!

362
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,041
Let's go to the arcade, Misaka!

363
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,416
It's been a long time...

364
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,958
and I want to take on
the punching machine again.

365
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,291
Great idea! The arcade!

366
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:04,125
[HARU'UE] Oh... in that case,
I want to do one of these again.

367
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,625
[KUROKO] Oh, yeah, I remember.

368
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,916
[UIHARU] We'll do that, too!

369
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,375
[SATEN] Let's go, let's go!

370
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,166
We need to clear our heads.

371
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,625
[MIKOTO] You guys...

372
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,750
Just one thing...

373
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,541
I want you to
remember this, Misaka.

374
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,083
[SATEN] No matter what,
we're always here for you.

375
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:25,083
If your burden is ever too
heavy, just say the word, okay?

376
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,458
[MIKOTO] Mmm.

377
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,750
[UIHARU] It really has been
a long time, hasn't it?

378
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,083
[SATEN] A long, long time!

379
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,833
[HARU'UE] I wonder if
the moles are still there.

380
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,250
[KUROKO] I'll show you the
technique I have for that game.

381
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,208
[MIKOTO] Yes. I can see now.

382
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,708
[KUROKO] I'm takin'
you down, just wait!

383
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,416
[MIKOTO] All the more reason...

384
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,958
[MIKOTO] However,
there are still the people

385
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,916
who took my DNA map and used
it for their sick experiment...

386
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,416
Them I intend to deal with.

387
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,458
[NUNOTABA] Well, aren't
you a defiant one ?

388
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,333
[NUNOTABA]
It isn't just one facility...

389
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,000
There are more than twenty.

390
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,208
Are you planning
to do this alone?

391
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,708
[MIKOTO] Yes, I am... No one
else needs to get involved.

392
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,250
[MIKOTO] I'm the one
who made this mess.

393
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,541
I will be the one...

394
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,333
...to clean it up.

395
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,958
[SATEN] Ugh... I'm still
worried about Misaka.

396
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:52,750
[UIHARU]
So am I.

397
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:53,500
[KUROKO] Time for a snack!

398
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:54,666
[UIHARU] Shirai?

399
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,916
[KUROKO] It's Anshindo's
special, magical,

400
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,750
limited-time-only summer buns!
