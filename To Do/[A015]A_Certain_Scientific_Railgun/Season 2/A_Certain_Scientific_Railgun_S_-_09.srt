1
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,416
[MIKOTO] So you're not going
to sell out your friends, huh?

2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,625
[FRENDA] No... I would,
I just can't talk.

3
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,291
All right... I can't
hold that against you.

4
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,875
[MIKOTO gasps]

5
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,250
[NUNOTABA] Moving the Sisters
that are being adjusted

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,583
would normally come last.

7
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,875
With the abrupt
transfer of control

8
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,458
and the watch out for attackers,

9
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,625
they've ignored
internal security.

10
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,250
If I'm really
going to do this...

11
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,500
it's now or never.

12
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,458
[NUNOTABA] S Processor--

13
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,375
the institute for
practical neuroscience?

14
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,500
[MALE RESEARCHER 8-B] Yes...

15
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,458
I do apologize for
the short notice...

16
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,625
but I wonder if you could
come over here right away.

17
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,291
I'll fill you in on
the details later.

18
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,791
It's better if
we talk in person.

19
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:32,333
[typing sounds]

20
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,708
[NUNOTABA] It isn't
just one facility...

21
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,000
There are more than twenty.

22
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,625
Are you planning
to do this alone?

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,875
[MIKOTO] Yes, I am...

24
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,583
No one else needs
to get involved.

25
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,875
I'm the one who
made this mess.

26
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,000
I will be the one...

27
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,958
...to clean it up.

28
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,250
She was right about that... huh.

29
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,125
[thud]

30
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,916
[MUGINO] It got quiet
in here all of a sudden.

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,416
I was sure the Electromaster
had finished you off.

32
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,750
It looks like I got here
just in time, though...

33
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,375
Hello Frenda.

34
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,041
[FRENDA] Muginooooo!

35
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,375
It's so good to see you!

36
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,375
What were you thinking?

37
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,708
My orders were to
keep her confined...

38
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,041
You weren't supposed to begin
a real attack 'til we arrived.

39
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,166
Instead, you provoked her
and got yourself caught.

40
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,625
What a rookie move...

41
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,916
If you'd listened to me,
this wouldn't have happened...

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,708
but you were too damn eager.

43
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,416
[TAKITSUBO] It's all right.
I understand...

44
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,041
You just get like
that sometimes.

45
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,875
I know you can't help it.

46
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,083
[FRENDA] What do you
mean I get like that?

47
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,333
Nice try...

48
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,416
You're the one who's been
causing all this trouble, huh?

49
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,750
[MIKOTO] She blocked it...

50
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,500
No... she blew it apart.

51
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,666
Well, well...

52
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,958
[MIKOTO yells]

53
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,750
[MUGINO] That's a nifty
little trick you've got...

54
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,541
running around, sticking
to the walls like that.

55
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,708
Almost like you're
a spider, huh?

56
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,458
Who is she?

57
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,333
[MUGINO] Takitsubo...

58
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,500
[MUGINO] You know what to do.

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,083
Have you seen her yet?

60
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,166
No, nothing so far...

61
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,125
Where on earth could
she have disappeared to?

62
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,458
And why now?

63
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,500
We're way too busy for this.

64
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,708
I guess we should contact
those so-called cleaners,

65
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,041
just in case...

66
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,791
I hope this doesn't turn
into some kinda' big deal.

67
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,583
[MALE RESEARCHER 8-A]
Yeah, same here.

68
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:04,208
Here we are...
Time to get started.

69
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,625
[MIKOTO] She didn't dodge...

70
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,458
No... she's actually
turning away my shocks.

71
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,708
[MUGINO laughs]

72
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,333
[FRENDA] Woo... what a show!

73
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:53,750
[MIKOTO] That's weird.

74
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,875
I don't know why...

75
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,833
but I get the feeling
she's dangerous.

76
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,500
[MUGINO] What now?
Trying to blind us?

77
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:18,000
That's not gonna buy
you enough time to--

78
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,416
Tch...

79
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,333
She got away... Takitsubo?

80
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,791
Not a problem...

81
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,875
I've memorized the target's
AIM diffusion field.

82
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,666
[MIKOTO] The odds
aren't in my favor,

83
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,583
going up against three
of them like that.

84
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,375
Shutting this place
down comes first.

85
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,333
[MIKOTO grunts]

86
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,416
[MIKOTO] Oh, crap!

87
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,083
I've overused my ability...

88
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,791
It's failing.

89
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,458
What?

90
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,583
But I'm moving in a
completely random pattern...

91
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,750
How could she--?

92
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,541
A lucky guess?

93
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,291
[MIKOTO] No...

94
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,500
not a guess.

95
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,916
[TAKITSUBO] She's dodging us.

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,208
The target remains
whole and active.

97
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,583
[MUGINO] Did she jump
up onto the ceiling?

98
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,791
That arachnid move of
hers is annoying...

99
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,958
Takitsubo...

100
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,041
[TAKITSUBO] Mm.

101
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,125
Huh?

102
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,750
[FRENDA] Those two are
as impressive as ever.

103
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,416
First we have...

104
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,625
Academy City's
fourth-ranked Level 5...

105
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,666
"Meltdowner."

106
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,958
And then...

107
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,000
Takitsubo, with the
ability to track a target,

108
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,291
even to the other
side of the world...

109
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,958
"AIM Stalker."

110
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,125
ITEM 's got it made with this
awesome Level 5-Level 4 combo.

111
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,041
Is there anybody who
could escape from them?

112
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,083
Aww towd, not
vewy wikewy! Huh?

113
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,208
'ey! I can tawk!

114
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,708
Aaaaahhh...

115
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,833
Aaaah... Aaaah....

116
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,250
I don't know who our
mystery saboteur is...

117
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,791
but I do know she won't be
at large for much longer.

118
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,750
All we have to do
now is box her in

119
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,125
and make certain
she can't escape.

120
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:13,500
[typing sounds]

121
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,208
[NUNOTABA] She's in the process
of raiding that facility...

122
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,666
However, even if
she is successful...

123
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,750
it probably won't
stall the project.

124
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,208
The people behind it are
swimming in deep water...

125
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,333
deep and dark.

126
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,500
[NUNOTABA] This is all the
emotional data on the Sisters

127
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,958
that has been
gathered up to now...

128
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:48,250
I'm going to install it
directly into their brains.

129
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,458
I doubt they will develop
any genuine feelings

130
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,583
from a program this minor.

131
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,625
But it should create
a simulated response.

132
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,250
I don't know if this will
be enough to make them

133
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,541
suspend the project or not...

134
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,625
However... it should at least
show the girls another path

135
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,375
besides the hopeless one
they currently walk.

136
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,000
A better path.

137
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,791
Right now the Sisters accept
dying prematurely as inevitable.

138
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:20,500
Maybe this will inspire some
of them to lament their fate.

139
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,041
And when they do...

140
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,250
maybe there will be some
researchers who see them

141
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,875
as more than just
mindless guinea pigs...

142
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,250
Maybe...

143
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,083
As unlikely as it seems now...

144
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,666
the girls will cry and say they
don't want to fight anymore...

145
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,500
And maybe...

146
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:42,083
Just maybe, that will
touch someone's heart.

147
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,500
It's probably
a stupid plan.

148
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,125
More likely than not...
attempting this is pointless...

149
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,416
but...

150
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,250
What I felt in that
moment up on the roof...

151
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,375
I thought you might actually
be an authorized staff member,

152
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,166
so I checked with
the people upstairs...

153
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,208
but they said that this
place was ultra-off-limits...

154
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,000
at least until the data
relocation was complete.

155
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,208
[NUNOTABA groans]

156
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,125
[KINUHATA] Up to now,
they suspected the attacks

157
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,875
were the work of one person...

158
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,958
but it's best not to
dismiss the possibility

159
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,458
that the attacks are
really a diversion.

160
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,458
Therefore, it is
advisable to make sure

161
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,416
all vulnerabilities
are accounted for...

162
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,333
Security should be
ultra tight and on alert

163
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,958
for both external
and internal threats.

164
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,291
So here we are...

165
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,958
and as usual, Mugino's reasoning
was right on the money.

166
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,041
[MIKOTO] There!

167
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,208
Now!

168
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,458
Okay!

169
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,958
Here we go!

170
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,208
Arming the entire facility
was a totally brilliant plan!

171
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,083
[MIKOTO] Sure enough...

172
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,833
no matter where I go,
they know my every move.

173
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,291
There's no question...

174
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,458
They've got a psychometrist
or a clairvoyant...

175
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,000
One or the other...

176
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,250
Somebody on that team
can pinpoint my location.

177
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,916
An esper.

178
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,666
All right!

179
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,875
[MIKOTO] This sucks!

180
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,708
I'm at a serious
disadvantage here...

181
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,125
Although...

182
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,750
[KINUHATA] Please stop your
pointless struggling.

183
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,708
I've got you and now I'll
turn you over to my client.

184
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,625
Resistance is ultra futile.

00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,875
[NUNOTABA groans]

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,583
[NUNOTABA]
Resistance is futile...

187
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,791
Maybe...

188
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,208
You might be right about that.

189
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,958
This project isn't
the only issue.

190
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,166
[NUNOTABA] Even supposing
I'm able to put a halt

191
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,750
to the project for good...

192
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,416
How can the cloned Sisters
possibly live normal lives?

193
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,583
Their empty, soulless eyes...

194
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,541
Their short lifespans...

195
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,250
Would that not be a crueler fate

196
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,000
than the experiment
has in store?

197
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,458
If so, better
to leave them be.

198
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,166
And yet...

199
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,333
She's borne the
weight of this...

200
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,500
All of it, on her own.

201
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:55,083
A fool... A noble fool.

202
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,041
Yes.

203
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,750
We are the ones who should
bear the burden of this sin.

204
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,875
For good or ill...

205
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,208
let them carve out
their own destinies.

[NUNOTABA grunts]

207
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,750
[MALE SUBORDINATE 9-B]
What the--?

208
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,958
Damn it!

209
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,833
It's no use.
The installation is complete.

210
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,916
They are all connected
by a brainwave link,

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,583
referred to as the
"Misaka Network."

212
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,208
The emotion program I
installed will be shared

213
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,750
by all the Sisters,
no matter where they are.

214
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,875
Now... nobody can stop it.

215
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:37,416
[alarm sounds]

216
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,833
What is that? What's happening?

217
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,750
[KINUHATA] I'm not entirely
sure what's going on.

218
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,083
But if I had to guess,

219
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,250
I'd say that whatever
your plan was, it failed.

220
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,875
[NUNOTABA] N-No way!

221
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,166
When did they install
that security ?

00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,125
[MALE SUBORDINATE 9-A] 'Kay,
so, what do we do with her?

223
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,125
What else? We haul her upstairs.

224
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,041
Roger that.

225
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,666
Come on. Up!

226
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,500
Start walking, you.

229
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,625
Little brat.

230
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,000
[NUNOTABA] Don't move!

231
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,375
If possible, I'd rather
not have to fire this.

232
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,958
Now just back up...
Nice and slow.

233
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,458
I'm not going
to do that.

234
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,333
It's ultra-commendable of you

235
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,041
to shoot something
that's not vital...

236
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,000
Especially at this
stage of the game.

237
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,625
But unfortunately for you,

238
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,375
a simple pistol can't
penetrate my "Offense Armor."

239
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,625
[NUNOTABA yells]

240
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,916
Let's try this again.
Please carry her upstairs.

241
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,375
[MALE SUBORDINATE 9-B]
Uh... Right.

242
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,125
[MALE SUBORDINATE 9-A]
Ugh... Damn...

243
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,791
That capsule in there...

244
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,750
It looks like it's
got somebody inside.

245
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,333
You should stop
looking at things

246
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,125
that aren't related to the job.

247
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,958
You wouldn't want to be
deemed a security risk.

248
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,916
Right. Sorry.

249
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,291
Come on, now. Let's
make it snappy, okay?

250
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,458
[MALE SUBORDINATE 9-B]
So what do you think.
they'll do with her?

251
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,291
Dunno.

252
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,666
And I ultra don't care.

253
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,666
We're just doing
our jobs, here...

254
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,958
If she is of any use,

255
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,166
her life will most likely
be spared, at least.

256
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,833
Of course...

257
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,416
I'm guessing that life
will be ultra-crappy...

258
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,875
Sad, lonely, pathetic,

259
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,708
and stripped of everything
she cares about.

260
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,916
Target changed
location.

261
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,750
Twenty meters
to the northwest.

262
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,708
Ah! I just can't
seem to hit her, huh?

263
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,083
[MUGINO] I don't think it's
only the way she's moving...

264
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:25,041
What if she's able to detect my
attacks before they reach her?

265
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,375
The only espers who
could do that are...

266
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,333
[FRENDA] Are you okay?

267
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,125
Mm-Hmm.
Still standing.

268
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,750
[MUGINO] Takitsubo's
"AIM Stalker" is handy...

269
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,583
but it's a difficult
ability to use

270
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,208
as it has to be
intentionally overdriven...

271
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:46,041
It can't be sustained for long.

272
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,375
The target's not covering as
much ground as she was before.

273
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,833
She must be near her
breaking point by now.

274
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,833
It's not worth it to use
Takitsubo any longer.

275
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:59,333
If we've pushed her this far,
and she still hasn't left...

276
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,458
that more than likely means
she has some compelling reason

277
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,750
to make sure this
place is destroyed.

278
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,875
If we just wait for her
at her destination...

279
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,750
She's sure to show
up sooner or later.

280
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,291
She's a wounded beast:
exhausted, but more

281
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,333
unpredictable and
dangerous than ever...

282
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,166
It's risky, but if I keep
my cool dealing with her,

283
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,791
I shouldn't have too
much to worry about.

284
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,583
Still...

285
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,125
[MUGINO laughs]

286
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,500
It's so unlike me to
set up an ambush.

287
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,083
I'm rather excited!

288
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,750
Hey, Frenda!

289
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,041
Eh?

290
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,000
Come on, keep moving...
Mikoto Misaka...

291
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,583
You don't have time to
slack off right now...

292
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,500
Get back on your feet.

293
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,291
Geez, not again!

294
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,208
Fire, fire, fiiirrre!

295
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,375
[MUGINO] Bye-bye...

00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:13,875
[MIKOTO] Crap!

298
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,291
I can't dodge!

299
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,416
[MUGINO gasps]

300
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,000
[MIKOTO] I knew it...

301
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,125
I suspected as much when I saw
her repel one of my shocks.

302
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,916
In the most basic sense...

303
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,958
her ability is actually
the same variety as my own.

304
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,833
My Meltdowner should've
taken her out.

305
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,541
Is something the
matter, Mugino?

306
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,833
[MUGINO gasps]

307
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,000
[MUGINO chuckles]

308
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,541
So that's it...

309
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,541
I understand now.

310
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,000
[FRENDA] Whoa!
We've got a woman down!

311
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,250
Are... you... sure...
you're... okay,

312
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,875
Ta... kit... su... bo?

313
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,041
[MUGINO] Frenda...

314
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,291
take Takitsubo and
meet up with Kinuhata.

315
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,375
[FRENDA] Huh?

316
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,500
I'll be all right.
I can still help.

317
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,958
[MUGINO] This isn't just
for your sake, though.

318
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,875
Frenda, you took
some serious damage

319
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,500
from the spider girl, huh?

320
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,958
You're playing through
the pain, but it's bad.

321
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,333
[FRENDA] Uh...

322
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,500
[MUGINO] And when Takitsubo
reaches her limit...

323
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,250
she can't detect enemy
attacks anymore...

324
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,458
It's too difficult for me to
protect both of you on my own...

325
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,958
Especially against this girl.

326
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,125
Oh, of course...

327
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sorry we've been
holding you back.

328
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,583
[MUGINO] It's not like
I'm blaming you for it.

329
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,666
In fact, I think you've
done quite well...

330
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,083
Thanks to the two of you,
our opponent is on the ropes.

331
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,916
Let Kinuhata bring
up the rear...

332
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,916
You get some rest.

333
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,500
[TAKITSUBO] Mugino...

334
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,000
She was...

335
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,958
...kind of nice to us!

336
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,500
[MUGINO] Yes...

337
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,458
I'd hate for anyone to
say that I defeated her

338
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,833
because the numbers
were in my favor.

339
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:10,083
Academy City's
third-ranked Level 5...

340
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,041
Heh, heh...
The Tokiwadai...

341
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,750
...Railgun!

342
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,666
[MUGINO] Railgun of Tokiwadai...

343
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,000
why won't you face me head on?

344
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,541
[MIKOTO] While I'm here doing
this, they're out there dying!

345
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,416
Stay the hell out of my way!
