1
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,166
[YOUNG MIKOTO]
I don't understand.

2
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,541
What is that boy doing?

3
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,166
[DOCTOR 2-A] This young man
has a serious disease

4
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,125
called muscular dystrophy.

5
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,541
Dys... what?

6
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,666
[DOCTOR 2-A] It's a disease
that makes his muscles

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,208
grow gradually weaker...

8
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,791
He's had it all his life...

9
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:51,125
It's the type of disease people
are born with, you see.

10
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,541
As you can tell,
he's fighting against it...

11
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,166
Trying to beat it.
To overcome it.

12
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,708
[DOCTOR 2-A] However...
no matter how hard he fights...

13
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,625
it's a battle he
is sure to lose.

14
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,458
Our current
medical science offers

15
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,291
no cure for this disease.

16
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,666
His muscles will
continue to weaken...

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,208
In time, he won't even
be able to stand up...

18
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,208
And then... finally...

19
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,166
his lungs and his heart
will stop working.

20
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,625
However, as I said,
that's only currently.

21
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,083
Things can always change.

22
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:39,666
You have an amazing
opportunity here.

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,458
Your ability can
help him and other people

24
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,250
like him who are suffering.

25
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,041
It's the simplest
thing in the world,

26
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,750
and all you have to do is
give us your DNA map, okay?

27
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,041
[DOCTOR 2-A] Thank you.

28
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,041
[MIKOTO] A dream...

29
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,250
Why would I dream about that?

30
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,791
Oh, right...

31
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,125
I went to see Edasaki yesterday,
and that must have...

32
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,000
[MIKOTO] Ahhhh!!

33
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,041
[KUROKO] Heeey! Sissy,
you're going too fast!

34
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,166
Wait for meeee!

35
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,458
[MIKOTO] Shut up, you perv!

36
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,208
But... But it was nothing...

37
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,333
I wanted to feel the warmth of
someone else's body, that's all!

38
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,583
[MIKOTO] I don't care
what you wanted.

39
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,875
You can't come crawling
into my bed like that!

40
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,375
So... that's all water
under the bridge now.

41
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,416
Where are you off to?

42
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,458
Well, you know how there's

43
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,583
that regional
field trip happening

44
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,458
at the beginning
of September, right?

45
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,125
[KUROKO] Oh... yeah.

46
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,333
I want to be
prepared for it,

47
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,416
so I thought I'd go buy

48
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,791
all the sundries
I'll need for traveling.

49
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,791
[KUROKO] Ughh...

50
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,125
What you mean
is that you're going

51
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,916
shopping for more
of the childish stuff

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,458
that you're so addicted to...

53
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,791
Despite the fact that our tiny
room is already overflowing

54
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,291
with fancy-looking knockoffs
of famous characters.

55
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,833
Did you say something?

56
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,416
[KUROKO] No, nothing at all.

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,041
So we get to have a
shopping date today, huh?

58
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,375
[MIKOTO] Ugh... Well,
it really isn't necessary

59
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,791
for you to tag along.

60
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,041
I don't mind, though...

61
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,250
Now, let me think a moment...

62
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,666
What else would be
useful for you to have

63
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,583
before going on the fieldtrip?

64
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,625
[MIKOTO] Maybe something
to stop creepy intruders

65
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,625
from sneaking into my bed?

66
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,583
You're still angry about
that little incident, then?

67
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,583
[MIKOTO] Not at all.

68
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,791
Right...

69
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,041
Well, I promise I can be helpful
in all sorts of ways today.

70
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,041
Here's an example!

71
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,916
If you are on
your way to the mall,

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,583
allow me to helpfully
point out this route

73
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,250
as a potential shortcut for you.

74
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,000
Now, then...
after you, Sissy.

75
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,458
Okay, fine...

76
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,375
But if you try to use this
as an excuse for groping me,

77
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,166
you won't enjoy
the consequences.

78
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,916
Oh, no, such a thought
never crossed my mind.

79
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,291
Wow.

80
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,500
It's so cramped
and narrow in here.

81
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,541
How do you even know
about this back alley?

82
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,083
It comes with the job...

83
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,083
I have every map of
the city memorized,

84
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,416
down to the last
nook and cranny.

85
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,666
[BLUE SHIRT GUY 2-A] Excuse me.

86
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,166
[KUROKO] No, go right ahead.

87
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,291
[MIKOTO] Passing people
is a little awkward

88
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,833
in such tight quarters, huh?

89
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,375
True, but fortunately that
doesn't happen very often.

90
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,083
[YELLOW CAP GUY 2-A] Excuse me.

91
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,500
[KUROKO and MIKOTO]
No, go right ahead.

92
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,708
So... is this, like, a
popular shortcut or something?

93
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,041
It's normally not this busy.

94
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,416
I don't know what
everyone's doing here.

95
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,708
[KUROKO] Honestly!
Why today of all days?

96
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,833
This is--

97
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,666
Whoa! Are you okay?

98
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,958
Except for this
huge pain in my head.

99
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,166
What? Is something wrong?

100
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,666
[KUROKO] No. I just thought I
saw something stuck under here.

101
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,541
[MIKOTO] An envelope?

102
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,916
[KUROKO] I think so...

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,708
but there's no name
or address on it.

104
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,208
[MIKOTO] What fell out?

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,750
It's a Money Card.
That's strange.

106
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,833
[UIHARU] Huh? So you found a
Money Card on the ground, too?

107
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,041
Too?

108
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,500
We've been receiving
a lot of reports over

109
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,583
the last few days from
people who have randomly

110
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,625
found Money Cards all
across School District 7.

111
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,750
There are now
forty-eight incidents.

112
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,291
[UIHARU] Oh... It just
jumped up to fifty-six.

113
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,416
That many?

114
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,583
[UIHARU] And that's
on the low end...

115
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,125
I'm sure not
everybody reports them.

116
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,125
Maybe this is the work

117
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,291
of some counterfeiting
operation.

118
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,500
[KONORI] We thought of that.

119
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,083
But all the cards that have been

120
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,416
turned into us
so far are genuine.

121
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,416
[MIKOTO] Really, Konori?
All of them?

122
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,750
[KONORI] Uh huh.

123
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,000
Something odd is going on...
I don't understand.

124
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,041
Why is this the first time

125
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,958
I'm hearing anything
about this case?

126
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,166
Here's the thing.

127
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,666
Intentionally destroying
or abandoning money

128
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,750
is prohibited by law... but
Money Cards are different.

129
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,166
They're exempt...

130
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,416
So there haven't been any
official notices put out.

131
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,291
[KUROKO] Yes, I see...

132
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,375
The amount on the
cards varies significantly.

133
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,083
Sometimes it's a thousand...

134
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,750
Other times it's fifty thousand.

135
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,166
Each of them
was left in a place

136
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,000
where there's generally
little human traffic.

137
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,666
And they were all
found inside envelopes.

138
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,541
In other words,
somebody is obviously

139
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,250
spreading these
around on purpose.

140
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,083
It's all seems
too involved

141
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,166
and organized to
be a simple prank...

142
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,458
There weren't even
any fingerprints

143
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,708
on the envelopes or
the cards themselves.

144
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,875
[UIHARU] As you would expect,

145
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,125
rumor of the mysterious
cards has spread.

146
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,125
So there are a ton
of people prowling

147
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,916
the alleyways,
looking for treasure.

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I know what you mean...

149
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,791
We saw it in action.

150
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,125
It's not just
that, either...

151
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,875
Students are stealing
from each other.

152
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,375
And some are even
getting caught up

153
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,583
in nasty fights after stumbling
into Skill Out territory.

154
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,166
[KUROKO] We cannot allow
this situation to continue.

155
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,000
Sorry, Sissy... Duty calls.

156
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,291
It looks like we'll have to put
off our date until another time.

157
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,875
Sure... I can go by myself.
Don't you worry about it.

158
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,708
Bye!

159
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,916
Doomed to suffer through
another lonely day.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,416
Thanks for your help.

161
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,875
If you don't mind, you can start
by searching in this area.

162
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,875
[MIKOTO] Now I can take my time
and actually enjoy shopping.

163
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,666
[GIRL STUDENT 2-A] I'm sorry!

164
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,666
It's okay. No worries.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,250
[GIRL STUDENT 2-B] Aww.

166
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,875
It doesn't look like there
are any of them here.

167
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,416
[GIRL STUDENT 2-A]
Oh. That's too bad.

168
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,458
[GIRL STUDENT 2-B]
I'm starting to think

169
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,208
that story was
really just a rumor.

170
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,541
[GIRL STUDENT 2-A]
But someone told me Rit

171
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,916
in Class B actually found one.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,875
[GIRL STUDENT 2-B] Yeah?
I didn't know that...

173
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,625
Rumors, huh?

174
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,750
I suppose it's no surprise
that Kuroko and I

175
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,875
hadn't heard about it, then.

176
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,333
Maybe this area
has already been picked clean.

177
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,208
[Oh, uh... hello, Saten.

178
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:02,083
Huh? Oh! Hey, Misaka!

179
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,666
So, what was up
with you earlier?

180
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,125
You didn't even say hello.

181
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,458
Huh? Earlier?

182
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,166
Don't act like you
don't remember...

183
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,000
It was just a little while ago.

184
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,208
You were walking in
front of Seventh Mist...

185
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,500
I called out to you,

186
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,500
but you kept walking
like I wasn't even there.

187
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,875
Sorry...

188
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm pretty sure that wasn't
me you were talking to.

189
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,416
What?

190
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,791
But I could've sworn I saw the

191
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,541
Tokiwadai school
uniform and everything.

192
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,958
I've been with Kuroko
and the others until now.

193
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,958
Okay, then.
Maybe it wasn't you.

194
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,666
So, anyway, what
exactly were you doing?

195
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,625
Chasing down a rumor
of abandoned Money Cards,

196
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,250
by any chance?

197
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,958
You know about that?

198
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,791
Taaaa... Da!

199
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,000
That's... amazing.

200
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,541
[SATEN] I know, pretty
impressive, huh?

201
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:46,000
I seem to have a really keen
nose when it comes to rumors.

202
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,041
Yeah... so I can see.

203
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,333
[SATEN] Right!

204
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,000
We need to go
check over here next.

205
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,833
[MIKOTO] Eh But I need
to do some shopping...

206
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,208
[SATEN] Just come on already!

207
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,041
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER 2-A] Full
school curfew is approaching...

208
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:06,250
All students, please
return home immediately.

209
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,875
Full school curfew
is approaching.

210
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,833
Awww...
It's already evening.

211
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,625
Time flies, huh?

212
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,833
Here...

213
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,291
You should have your
share of the day's take!

214
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,250
Great, thank you...
Oh! No, I can't!

215
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,875
Those should really
be turned in.

216
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,208
[SATEN] Yeah,
you're probably right...

217
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll hand them over
to Uiharu later on.

218
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,708
[MIKOTO] I wanted to ask you...

219
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,208
Have you by
chance heard any rumors

220
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,208
about who's responsible for
distributing those cards?

221
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,541
Huh...

222
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,833
Now that you mention it,
I haven't heard anything.

223
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,500
Hmmm...

224
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,250
Well, I'll see you later.

225
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,458
We can bring Uiharu
next time, too.

226
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,541
Yeah, sure.

227
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,625
[SATEN] All right! Bye!

228
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,833
Have a good one! Bye!

229
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,833
Aw, man...

230
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,500
I ended up wasting
the entire day on that...

231
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,416
I didn't get any
shopping done at all.

232
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,166
Tellin' ya, it's true.

233
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,833
[SKILL OUT 2-A] I was going
into an alley in Block E

234
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,291
to take a leak.

235
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,916
I saw some chick carefully
set down an envelope there.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,208
So I followed her.

237
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,083
[SKILL OUT 2-B] Yeah, and?

238
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,500
Well...

239
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,583
I saw her go into a multi-tenant
building in Block C...

240
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,500
That must be her base.

241
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,083
That's it?
Just the one girl?

242
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,833
She's gotta have
somebody with her.

243
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,125
Naw, I made sure of it...

244
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,666
The sweet girlie
is all by herself.

245
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,833
Let's check it out, then.

246
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,500
[SKILL OUT 2-B] So you're
sure that she's alone?

247
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,791
[SKILL OUT 2-A]
I staked the place out.

248
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,458
[SKILL OUT 2-C]
That is some work ethic, man.

249
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,791
[SKILL OUT 2-B] Haven't
heard anything this good

250
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,416
in a while, huh?

251
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,333
Hey, Kuroko?
Yeah... It's me...

252
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,500
[MIKOTO] Listen...
I need a little favor.

253
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,416
[UIHARU] Oh! Good, you're back!

254
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,958
Are you all
done with the count?

255
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,125
[UIHARU] Yep.
Today's total is...

256
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,041
Seventy-three incidents.

257
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,541
It gets higher
and higher each day, huh?

258
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,958
So, why isn't Shirai here?

259
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,791
Apparently something
important came up

260
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,166
and she had to take off.

261
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,500
Oh, yeah?

262
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,458
[ringing]

263
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,875
Well...

264
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,583
If you need me, I'll be
eating... Eating... Eating...

265
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,041
Yes, hello?

266
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,250
Oh... hey, Saten... Huh?

267
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,541
Oh... Really?

268
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,750
You found one of the
Money Cards, too?

269
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,750
Yes, sure, that's fine.

270
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,625
Tomorrow or whenever...

271
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,250
Oh, one other thing...

272
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,083
No problem...

273
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,208
You just need me to hang out

274
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,166
with Haru'ue until
you get back, right?

275
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,458
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

276
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,458
[SATEN] Oh, hold on a second.

277
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,541
There was something
I wanted to ask you about.

278
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,166
What? Did I see Misaka today?

279
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,458
Yes... She was actually
here with Shirai

280
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,666
earlier this afternoon dropping
off one of the Money Cards.

281
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,000
She was, really?

282
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,000
All right, then, I guess
I must've been wrong.

283
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,500
I probably just mistook
someone else for her...

284
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,416
No... It's nothing, really...

285
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,083
I'll see you later.

286
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,125
This makes no sense.

287
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,083
It looked just like her.

288
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,041
What? Misaka
has a look-alike?

289
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,541
Yes... Saten said she
saw her earlier today.

290
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,250
Now that you
mention it...

291
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,125
there were stories about
Level 5 clones a long time ago.

292
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,625
Seriously?

293
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,458
[KONORI] There was some
research facility somewhere

294
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:12,416
that used cloning technology
to try mass-producing Level 5s.

295
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,166
Or so the story goes.

296
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,583
That does sort of sound
like Academy City

297
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,125
and like a rumor Saten
would sink her teeth into.

298
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,541
Absolutely.

299
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,666
[KUROKO] Coming!

300
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,458
Oh, Head Resident...
Nice of you to drop by...

301
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,666
I see you're as
diligent as ever.

302
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,958
[HEAD RESIDENT]
Hey... where is Misaka?

303
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,250
[MIKOTO]
Can you hear me, Kuroko?

304
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,000
Where did you put the shampoo?

305
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,541
Shampoo? I should
get that for her...

306
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,916
If you'll please excuse me,
Head Resident...

307
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,875
Just a second,
Sissy, I'm getting it!

308
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,291
[MIKOTO] Geez, can't
you move any faster?!

309
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,791
[KUROKO] Okay, okay.

310
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,000
[MIKOTO] Kuroko,
my towel is all w--

311
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,750
Why are you coming in--

312
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,833
Aren't I a good
roommate, Sissy?

313
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,250
Fooling the head resident

314
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,000
because you didn't make it
back home before curfew...

315
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,750
Imagine what would have happened

316
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,750
if I hadn't had my
"Secret Sissy Voice Collection."

317
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,708
You would've been
in big trouble.

318
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,458
It's been a while since you've
been late like this...

319
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,250
It used to happen a
lot more frequently.

320
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,083
Where are you?

321
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,958
[SKILL OUT 2-A] Hey! Hope you
don't mind some company.

322
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,833
[SKILL OUT 2-A]
Take it nice and easy

323
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,000
and nothing has to get violent.

324
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,125
Was there something
that you needed?

325
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,625
[SKILL OUT 2-D] It's like this.

326
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,500
You know those cards you've
been spreading around town?

327
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:52,041
We thought we'd stop by and take
all the rest of 'em from ya.

328
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,791
[SKILL OUT 2-A] Easy, now!

329
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,166
It would be a real pain for us

330
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,083
if you hit some kind
of panic button,

331
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,416
so I think we'll just take a
look in there ourselves... Hey!

332
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,041
[SKILL OUT 2-C] On it.

333
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,958
[SKILL OUT 2-C] What the--

334
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,583
Looks like she's only
got two of 'em here.

335
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,583
What?

336
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,958
There's none
over here, either...

337
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,125
We came all the way out
here for two freakin' cards?

338
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,375
Are you kidding?

339
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,583
Yeah.

340
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,333
I'd rather not raise
my hand against a woman.

341
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,708
It's really not my style...

342
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,166
So why don't you just
tell us where they ar--

343
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,791
[NUNOTABA]
There aren't any more here.

344
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,541
Understand?

345
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,666
They've already
been distributed.

346
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,083
No way, she's lying.

347
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,416
And you seem a
little too relaxed,

348
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,166
considering the situation.

349
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,208
What's with you... huh?

350
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,416
Hey, you're right...

351
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,250
You think she has an ability?

352
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,000
[SKILL OUT 2-D]
So what if she does?

353
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,541
There aren't many of them

354
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,333
that can do anything
against a group this big...

355
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,625
For now, let's search
this place top to bottom...

356
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,041
You. Keep an eye on her, got it?

357
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,916
Yeah... Sure.

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,375
What are you
so spooked about?

359
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,083
Spooked? What?
I'm not spooked!

360
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,750
[SKILL OUT 2-D] Hey...
Shut up and do it already.

361
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,416
[rummaging sounds]

362
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,833
[SKILL OUT 2-A]
Any luck over there?

363
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,750
[SKILL OUT 2-B] Nothing...
Damn it, where are they?

364
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,083
[SKILL OUT 2-A]
Shut up and keep looking.

365
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,958
[SKILL OUT 2-C] Damn...
I don't know what it is...

366
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,625
but something about
this chick creeps me out.

367
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,833
[SKILL OUT 2-C]
That school badge...

368
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,666
I've seen it somewhere.

369
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,125
[SKILL OUT 2-C]
Nagatenjoki Academy?

370
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,583
[SKILL OUT 2-C] No way...

371
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,291
That's the most elite school
in the whole entire city!

372
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,875
And that's gotta mean this girl
is a high-level ability user!

373
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,125
[SKILL OUT 2-C]
No, hold on, calm down...

374
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,291
That place is different
than Tokiwadai.

375
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,416
They take students who are good

376
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
at other things
besides abilities...

377
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,375
So she may not
have one, after all.

378
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,416
Maybe she's just smart.

379
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,333
[SKILL OUT 2-C]
What're ya' staring at?

380
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,250
[NUNOTABA] Your skin--
it looks a little pale...

381
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,291
Are you sure you feel okay?

382
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,125
[SKILL OUT 2-C] B-back off.

383
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,666
[NUNOTABA] You're
breathing hard, too.

384
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,375
And that's a nasty cold sweat.

385
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,500
It looks like you're
shaking pretty badly.

386
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,208
Hey...!

387
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,208
Almost like...

388
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,416
How did you know that?

389
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,333
I just do.

390
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,791
[SKILL OUT 2-C] 
Ahhh!

391
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,625
[SKILL OUT 2-A]
Hey, what's wrong?

392
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,958
What... what the
hell did you do?

393
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,250
Man... she's got one!

394
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,083
She's got an ability!

395
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,458
If she did,
wouldn't she have

396
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,500
attacked us earlier
and been done with it?

397
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,666
But she isn't packing...

398
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,708
How else could she
have taken out our guy?

399
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,833
[NUNOTABA] There's a
condition to activate it.

400
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,083
My ability...

401
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,416
It's called "Critical."
It can only be used

402
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,458
against those I've
come into contact with.

403
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,833
It takes one touch.

404
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,333
After that, no matter
how far you run...

405
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,666
no matter where you hide...

406
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,291
I can end your life.

407
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,416
 Yeah, right...
Just another lie.

408
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,458
You expect us to believe you?

409
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,916
There's no ability like that.

410
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,458
Give it up already.

411
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,750
[NUNOTABA] Whether
you believe me or not

412
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,416
is totally up to you...

413
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,416
There are many
variations of the ability

414
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,916
that I possess,
but they are real enough.

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,166
I can trace and tamper

416
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,958
with others using their
AIM diffusion fields.

417
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,083
Of course...

418
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,125
to Level Zeroes,
such as yourselves...

419
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,500
that description may
not mean very much.

420
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,583
Please...

421
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,208
That's a buncha crap,
and you know it.

422
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,541
Hey! What's with you?

423
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,541
I... I touched her before...

424
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,250
What's gonna happen to me?

425
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,000
If what she's saying is true,
I could be a gonner!

426
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,666
Don't freak out, you moron...

427
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,625
It's like I already said,
she's full of it.

428
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,208
[SKILL OUT 2-A] M-Maybe, but...

429
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,416
It's not gonna
do us any good

430
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,625
to start fighting each other.

431
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,875
[NUNOTABA] Very true.

432
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,333
Fighting amongst
friends is never the answer.

433
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,166
Come on!

434
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,708
[SKILL OUT 2-B]
Hey! What do I do now?

435
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,458
[SKILL OUT 2-A] Just calm down!

436
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:48,791
Shut up...
I can take care of this.

437
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,250
[SKILL OUT 2-D] What?

438
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,583
[scream]

439
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,833
[SKILL OUT 2-D]
Wh-What was that?

440
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,916
Hey... you guys...!

441
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,125
[scream]

442
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,041
[SKILL OUT 2-D] Damn...
What the hell is going on here?

443
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,333
[SKILL OUT 2-D]
You're kidding, right?

444
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,875
Oh, good.
Only one more to go.

445
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,041
[SKILL OUT 2-D]
Lights off again?

446
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:33,916
[SKILL OUT 2-D] I'll get her!
I'll get her good!

447
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,125
[SKILL OUT 2-D] I can hear you!

448
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:41,250
[pained moans]

449
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,708
[SKILL OUT 2-D] Crap...
My pipe! Where did it go?

450
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,875
[approaching footsteps]

451
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:53,541
[SKILL OUT 2-D] Damn!
What's she doing to me?

452
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:57,416
What's happening?
Turn on the liiigghts!

453
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,708
[NUNOTABA]
All it takes is one touch.

454
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,666
Now my ability has you.
Don't worry. It's all right.

455
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,875
It will be over before
you can feel any pain...

456
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,541
Just like it was when
I took care of your friends.

457
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,750
[SKILL OUT 2-D]
Wait, you don't have to!

458
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,291
I'll get out of here...
I'll leave!

459
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,125
I'm sorry! Don't kill me!

460
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,250
[NUNOTABA] It's simple, really.

461
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,958
All I have to do
now is lower my hand.

462
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:30,916
[NUNOTABA] Three...
Two... One... Zero...

463
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,333
[SKILL OUT 2-D] Noooo!!

464
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,916
[pop]

465
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:42,166
Well. I got a pretty decent
'pop' out of this thing.

466
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,916
That was an
impressive show you put on.

467
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,250
Special effects and all.

468
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,250
The whole time
I was waiting

469
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,625
to step in if things got ugly...

470
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,875
I never expected
you to neutralize

471
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,583
this many Skill
Outs so easily...

472
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:59,750
And all with just narrative,
showmanship, and what is that?

473
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,541
Some kind of anesthetic?

474
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,500
[MIKOTO] Is something wrong?

475
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,333
[NUNOTABA] So, it's you...

476
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,125
[NUNOTABA] The Original.

477
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,750
[NUNOTABA]
So, it's you... the Original.

478
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,083
[KUROKO] That's right!

479
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,833
My original "Secret Sissy
Voice Collection" played

480
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,500
a vital role in this episode!

481
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,625
[MIKOTO] No, it did not!
