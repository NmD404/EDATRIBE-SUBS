1
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,625
[ACCELERATOR] Amazing!

2
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,708
It's like a part of my body!

3
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,750
Like moving my own arms or legs!

4
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,791
All of this air is completely
under my control!

5
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,125
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

6
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,250
So fighting someone
stronger really was

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,708
a shortcut to leveling up!

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,791
Guess they were right all along!

9
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,625
Thanks, third-string!

10
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,250
You served your purpose well,

11
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,500
and now I'm going
to destroy you! Huh?

12
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,916
How could this be
happening now?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,625
It looks like the
plasma is diffusing.

14
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,041
Why is the wind
suddenly acting like this?

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,875
It's not wind manipulation?

16
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,625
So, what?

17
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,166
The windmills are
turning the wrong way.

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,333
Hold on.

19
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,041
I've heard about this before.

20
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,958
It's something about
dynamo motors.

21
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,291
When they're hit by particular
electromagnetic waves, they--

22
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,750
Is it them?

23
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,958
Damn it. What do they
think they're doing?

24
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,083
Those windmills aren't just
spinning around haphazardly.

25
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:23,166
They're being directed
to disrupt my formulas!

26
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,250
She's doing it!

27
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,916
The images she sees are
going across the network!

28
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,625
I'm gonna' kill you!

29
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,208
I won't let you!

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,583
I don't understand
you people.

31
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,583
First we have a gallant
appearance from third-string.

32
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,083
And then you show up.

33
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,333
Just to defend
this wind-up doll.

34
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:04,083
That's an overproduced,
factory reject of yourself.

35
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,000
I would think, out of
everyone in the world,

36
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,958
you would be the most
disgusted by it.

37
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,500
Or maybe it freaks you
out to see something

38
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,625
that looks like you
getting all beat up.

39
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,166
But then, that's not
a very good reason

40
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,500
to put your life on the line.

41
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,333
[ACCELERATOR laughs]

42
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,791
So maybe you just can't
stand to have somebody else

43
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,000
become a Level 6 before you.

44
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,416
Or, maybe, it's some kind
of atonement for being

45
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,500
the reason they started these
experiments in the first place.

46
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,416
[MIKOTO] I don't desire power
for power's sake the way you do.

47
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,208
Nor do I think of this as
atonement for any of the things

48
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,791
that I've done
wrong in the past.

49
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,750
She's my sister.

50
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,291
All of these girls.

51
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,291
They are my little sisters.

52
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,791
That's why I'm here.

53
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,916
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,083
After all this time, I have
no right to ask you this,

55
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,125
but still...

56
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:09,750
Just this one time, may I
fulfill my role as big sister?

57
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,000
[MISAKA 10032] Yes.

58
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,541
[MIKOTO] Heh.

59
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:22,083
I will not let another
one of them die!

60
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,958
[ACCELERATOR] Huh?

61
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,125
[ACCELERATOR laughs]

62
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,166
Man, that's rich!

63
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,375
I have to admit that I
didn't see that one coming.

64
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,750
Playing at sisters?
That's a good one!

65
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,541
You're way out of
your league here.

66
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,458
If there's something I
wanna do, you can't stop me.

67
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,875
Two little girls like you
can't even slow me down.

68
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,750
It's kind of like
how a person's vision

69
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,208
can only be measured
up to 20/20.

70
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,000
Level 5 is the highest
rank an esper can attain

71
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,208
in Academy City.

72
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,916
So that's where I'm stuck,

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,916
even though I'm better
than the rest of you.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,958
I'm sick of looking at the
same damn face day after day,

75
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,125
so I'm gonna kill all--

76
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,250
[thud]

77
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,125
[MIKOTO gasps]

78
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,416
[ACCELERATOR] Impossible.

79
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,833
Doesn't he get it?

80
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,875
I'm the most experienced killer
this city's ever seen.

81
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,958
I know so much about what it
takes to destroy a person,

82
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,625
I'm almost sick of it.

83
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,625
He's standing.

84
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:48,041
He shouldn't even... be alive.

85
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,916
[ACCELERATOR] What am I doing?

86
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,916
[ACCELERATOR] This idiot just
doesn't know when to quit.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,041
Sure, I lost control
of the wind.

88
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,333
But I can still finish him off.

89
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,916
All I need is one touch.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,416
This really has
been fascinating.

91
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,833
But I've had enough.

92
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,333
It ends now!

93
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,125
[ACCELERATOR yells]

94
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,625
[ACCELERATOR screams]

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,875
[KAMIJO] You're the strongest
guy in Academy City.

96
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,166
That's not gonna
help you now.

97
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,541
The weakest guy
is taking you down.

98
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,791
[ACCELERATOR] I don't get it.

99
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,875
Why can't I break this guy?

100
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,416
He's protecting them.
The wind-up dolls.

101
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,583
I was one step away from it.
From absolute power.

102
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,000
And now. And now.

103
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,000
[ACCELERATOR] What if
having too much power,

104
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,958
turns the world
itself against me?

105
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,125
Ultimately resulting
in destruction,

106
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,333
rather than protection.

107
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,166
[SUNGLASSES MAN 11-A]
Just think.

108
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,375
If you were to gain even
greater power than you have.

109
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,500
Then what would
your life be like?

110
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,166
[LEVEL 6 PROJECT GUY]
Just do the experiments,

111
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,458
you have nothing to lose.

112
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,375
It's not like any
people will get hurt.

113
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:52,875
[ACCELERATOR] Guinea pigs.
Wind-up dolls. Clones.

114
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,958
It's not like I'm
seeking immortality.

115
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,750
I just want to
gather enough power

116
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,541
that nobody will ever
want to fight me again.

117
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,750
If that happens.

118
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,958
[CHILDREN laugh and yell]

119
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,166
[ACCELERATOR]
Then someday, maybe.

120
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,458
If that happens, then.

121
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,541
[ACCELERATOR] Then, no one will.

122
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,750
[KAMIJO] So many Sisters,
living the best that they can.

123
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,041
[MIKOTO] All of these girls.

124
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,791
They're my sisters.

125
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,166
[ACCELERATOR] Really.

126
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,500
[ACCELERATOR] What am
I even doing anymore?

00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,458
Just thought I
would drop by.

Oh, guess he's asleep.

[footsteps]

136
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,583
To think he actually defeated
the first-ranked esper

137
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,791
in Academy City.

138
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,875
You must be crazy
or something.

139
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,583
You know that?

140
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,916
Uh... Sorry. Did I wake you?

Uh. Here! Get well soon!

142
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,291
I picked the most expensive
cookies the store had.

143
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,833
For the price, I'm guessing
they're pretty good.

144
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,125
I just thought...

145
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,708
I really ought to try
and do something to,

146
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,583
you know, say thank--

147
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,250
When it comes to cookies...

148
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,458
Don't people say
homemade are the best?

149
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,333
Huh?

150
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,583
Heh, heh. Is that so?

151
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,166
Can you seriously picture
me baking cookies?

152
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,708
[KAMIJO] No, never.

153
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,416
I'm pretty sure if you tried
to the cookies would come out

154
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
all misshapen and disgusting.

155
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,166
It would be ugly for sure.

156
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,250
[MIKOTO] I meant that
baking's not my style,

157
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,458
not that I can't do it!

They're over, but
because of me so many...

[KAMIJO] Well, you know,
if you hadn't offered them

170
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:50,375
your DNA map, none of the
sisters would ever have existed.

171

That experiment was
messed up in a lot of ways,

but at least there was something
good that came from it.

[MIKOTO] How are
your injuries doing?

184
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,666
[MISAKA 10032] These are
really nothing serious

185
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,041
compared to what
happened to that boy.

186
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,375
Good. I'm glad.

187

[GIRL 16-B] Ha, ha, ha! Yay!

[MIKOTO] Lives created

They're born without

Blank slates.

192
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,166
So it's not surprising
that when they are told

193
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,000
they're nothing but lab rats.

194
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:59,041

it as the simple truth.

Then surely, they can--

So, listen, um.

200
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,791
You probably can't
forgive what I did.

It seemed like a

After all, it's not like this

00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,083
Mikoto Misaka!

352
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,541
What?

353
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,125
[MIKOTO] I have an actual name!

354
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,875
It's Mikoto Misaka.
It isn't Zapper.

355
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,833
You always call me that.

356
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,250
Try using my real name sometime!

357
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,333
Then again, maybe that's
just too much to ask of you.

358
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,708
[KAMIJO chuckles]

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,708
[KAMIJO] See you later, Misaka.

360
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,833
[KUROKO] I've got bad news!

361
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,083
Listen, Sis-

362
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,500
What happened? What's
the matter with you?

363
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,416
Ah! Are you feeling okay?

364
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,750
Are you hurt somewhere?

365
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,958
Did you eat something that
didn't agree with you?

366
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,541
[MIKOTO] What? What
are you talking about?

367
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,208
And what's this bad
news you mentioned?

368
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,125
Oh, about that.

369
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,333
The head resident seems to
have learned about the nights

370
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,708
you've been away from the
dorms without permission.

371
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,208
She says you'd better have
a very good explanation

372
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,125
for your absence.

373
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,583
[MIKOTO] That's bad, huh?

374
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,291
I'm gonna need an excuse.

375
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:51,041
Wait--you came all the way
out here just to tell me that?

376
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,541
Thank you.

377
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,875
But how did you
know where I was?

378
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,791
Huh? As they say,
"like calls to like."

379
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,500
Wherever Sissy is,
there too will be Kuroko.

380
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,875
But more importantly, are
you sure everything is okay?

381
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,583
Because if anything were
to happen to you, Sissy,

382
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,666
I wouldn't rest until I
had done everything tha--

383
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,125
[MIKOTO] Honestly.

384
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,791
Keep talking crazy and
I'll leave you here.

385
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,750
Can you really
blame me, Sissy?

386
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,041
There was a look on your face

387
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,583
that I've never
seen there before.

388
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,750
[UIHARU] I'm so glad
Misaka's feeling better now!

389
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,375
[SATEN] I still want to know
who those cookies were for!

390
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,291
[KUROKO] Exposed!

391
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,708
[UIHARU] Uh, Shirai?

392
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:56,708
[KUROKO] It's time to come
out of your shell, Sissy.

393
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,416
Body and soul!
