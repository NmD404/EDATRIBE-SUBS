[sobbing]

2
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,083
I'm home, Mikoto.

3
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,666
What's the matter, dear?

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,583
Why are you crying?

5
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,041
Oh, a boo-boo!

6
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,000
Now, now, it'll be all right.

7
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,083
[YOUNG MIKOTO] Really?

8
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,375
You just be a good girl,

9
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,666
and it will be fixed up,
as good as new.

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,166
How's that gonna happen...?

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,500
Ooh, I know!

12
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,625
Is Santa gonna come
and make it all better?

13
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,416
[MISAKA'S MOM] Heh,
heh, heh. Santa...?

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,666
In the middle of spring?

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,250
Yep... that's right...

16
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,333
The old fellow is a friend of
mine, so I'll see what I can do.

17
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,000
You know Santa?!

18
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,791
Sure!

19
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,583
Now, close those eyes
and get some sleep, okay?

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,250
[MISAKA'S MOM] There...

21
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,458
breakfast is served.

22
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,333
[YOUNG MIKOTO] Mama!

23
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:34,416
[YOUNG MIKOTO laughs]

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,666
Look, Mama! All better...!

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,708
See...? Just like you told me!

26
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,041
That's right...

27
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,708
[MIKOTO] Life was so much
simpler as a child...

28
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,875
Whenever something went wrong,
Mama would fix it while I slept.

29
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,916
Like magic.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,958
If only the
experiment...

31
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,875
and everything
that's happened...

32
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,333
could just be a bad dream...

33
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,041
Something that vanished...

34
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:58,458
evaporated when
I opened my eyes.

35
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,666
Isn't it a beautiful
morning, Sissy?!

36
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,333
[KUROKO] Oh, I just want
a moment to savor this

37
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,416
before getting punched.

38
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,333
Hey... Good morning.

39
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,833
[MIKOTO] It is a nice day today.

40
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,000
[MIKOTO] But I haven't
been dreaming.

41
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,458
Mama isn't here now to make
every little problem go away.

42
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,750
Santa stopped making house
calls a long time ago.

43
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,000
[KUROKO hums]

44
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,416
[MIKOTO] And no hero is going to

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,833
come dashing to
the rescue, either.

46
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,041
[KUROKO] Are you
going out again today?

47
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,583
[MIKOTO] Yeah.

48
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,833
Just once more.

49
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,250
Then it should all be over.

50
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,500
Huh?

51
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,000
[MIKOTO] Today...

52
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,541
[MIKOTO] Today is the day...

53
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,333
I'm ending this.

54
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,916
[MIKOTO] It's almost time now.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,833
Sorry, guys.

56
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,083
Maybe someday
you'll forgive me...

57
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,166
Maybe someday you'll understand.

58
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,708
[MIKOTO] Tree Diagram...

59
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,250
The greatest supercomputer
in the world.

60
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,708
Loaded aboard the
satellite Orihime I

61
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,750
and launched into
space by Academy City

62
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,583
under the pretense that it would
be analyzing climate data.

63
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,416
Every few weeks, it
projects the movement

64
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,833
of all the particles in
the Earth's atmosphere,

65
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,333
predicting the weather for
the entire month in one go...

66
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,625
The rest of the time,
it performs calculations

67
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,875
for all sorts of Academy
City-based research projects.

68
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,208
Also...

69
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,875
It is the simulator that's
directing the creation

70
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,333
and slaughter of twenty
thousand clones.

71
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,375
[KAMIJO] Hey.

72
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,125
Remedial lessons
for you too, huh...?

73
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,500
What class did you fail, Zapper?

74
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,666
Oh, hey...
It's you again.

75
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,250
My name's Mikoto
Misaka, not Zapper.

76
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,083
I'm really tired, and
there are some things

77
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,791
I need to save my
strength for today...

78
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,375
So I'm just going to skip
the part where I zap you.

79
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,750
Oh, so you can say
"zap," but I can't?

80
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,958
Never mind...

81
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,875
Your sister's not
with you today?

82
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,916
I just wanted to thank
her for helping me

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,750
carry all those drinks
home yesterday.

84
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,583
Hold on...!

85
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,041
You mean you saw her again?

86
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,958
Uh, yeah... I saw her.

87
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,291
What for?

88
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,708
What do you mean,
"what for?"...

89
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,791
I just ran into her, that's all.

90
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,041
Sun again tomorrow!

91
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,458
[MIKOTO] Stupid things...

92
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,208
I really can't
stand those blimps.

93
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,041
[KAMIJO] Huh?

94
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,000
What's wrong with them?

95
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,208
[MIKOTO] They're nothing
but big computers.

96
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,791
Programmed to control us.

97
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,333
For now.

98
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,916
But Tree Diagram's
reign is about to end...

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,083
I'm destroying that machine.

100
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,000
[KAMIJO] Uh...? Hey!

101
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,458
[MIKOTO] Today!

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,708
[KAMIJO] What is the
deal with that girl...?

103
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,083
I mean, jeez!

104
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,708
Is she always
so high-strung?

105
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,375
[KAMIJO] Eh?

106
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,541
Hey, Zapper.

107
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,208
You were just over
there, weren't you?

108
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,291
[MISAKA 10032] "Since Misaka's
name is obviously not Zapper...

109
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,083
I can only assume that you
are referring to the cat,"

110
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,083
Misaka tells the rude boy.

111
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,333
Oh, sorry. You're
the sister, huh...?

112
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:22,083
Without the goggles, there's
no way to tell you two apart.

113
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,500
Oh, by the way...
thank you for yesterday.

[MISAKA 10032] "Your words
of gratitude are noted,

115
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,666
but they were not my objective,"
replies Misaka honestly.

116
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,375
"I removed the goggles because
I needed to feed the cat,

117
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,375
and previous experience
has taught me that

118
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,625
they are disturbed by reflective
surfaces, such as lenses,"...

119
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,208
Misaka explains
her wardrobe change.

120
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,750
Yeah, cats are like that...

121
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,166
So... Why put them
back on, then?

122
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,041
"Because it was
no longer necessary

123
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,458
to have them off. See?"
asks Misaka patiently.

124
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,458
Okay...

125
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,083
so you fed him already?

126
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,541
No, I haven't fed him.

127
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,708
Uh...

128
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,250
then why did you put
the goggles back on?

129
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,708
Well?

[MISAKA 10032 "The reason behind
that action is unimportant,"

Misaka says,
refusing to explain.

132
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,916
Huh?

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,416
Ah, I get it...

You didn't want anybody seeing
your sweet side, did you?

135

[MISAKA 10032] No.

136
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,625
It is not that, exactly.

137
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,333
Fine, I give. What is it?

138
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,166
Hello!

"I refuse to answer that,"

Misaka states, making
herself quite clear.

[KAMIJO sighs]

142
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,791
Well... all right,
if you say so.

143
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,291
See you later.

"Hold on a moment,"

Misaka says, instructing
you to stop walking.

146
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,500
Just tell me what
the deal is, will ya?

147
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,958
"You were going to leave...

You were going to
abandon this creature.

Walking away from a
helpless, hungry cat.

How can you bring yourself
to do something so cruel...?

00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,666
Well?"... Misaka asks sternly.

152
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,166
What's with you?

153
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,791
I'm not abandoning him.

00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,000
You've got food!

"Misaka does have food,
but feeding the cat

156
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,041
is nonetheless
impossible for her,"

00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,166
Misaka says, finally relenting.

158
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,833
"Misaka has a
critical defect

159

that prevents her from
interacting with the cat,"

160

Misaka explains further.

161
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,541
A defect...?

162

is appropriate...

It constantly emits a
weak magnetic field,"...

166

Misaka says,
explaining her defect.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,083
It is not strong enough
for people to detect,

168

but animals are
highly sensitive to it.

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,458
Okay, so... let me
see if I understand.

170
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,916
Animals tend not to like you
because you're a walking magnet?

[MISAKA 10032] "It is not
that they do not like me.

to be around me,"...

your previous statement.

in and give him a home?"...

her own analysis.

00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,875
and foist caring for the cat
onto somebody else."...

351
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,500
Misaka says, clarifying.

352
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,333
No, that isn't what
I'm saying at all.

353
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,333
What's wrong...? Are you angry?

354
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,791
"No, I am not angry...

355
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,666
However, if you fail
to treat the cat

356
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,166
with adequate care
and concern...

357
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,708
I will have you charged with
destruction of property,"

358
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,583
states Misaka as
a serious warning.

359
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,416
I knew it. You are angry.

360
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,250
No, I am not angry.

361
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,041
Well, I'm gonna go in
and see what I can find...

362
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,250
You wait out here for me.

363
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,458
"I understand,"...

364
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,500
Misaka acknowledges
the instruction.

365
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,250
There was a hidden
meaning in there, I know it.

366
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,875
Oh... now that I
think about it...

367
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,625
I probably shouldn't go into
the store carrying a cat.

368
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,750
I do not mean to sound as if
I am lecturing you about this,

369
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,833
but please do not give him
to me, as I cannot hold--

370
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,125
[KAMIJO] Here,
catch! Kitty Bomb!

371
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,208
Your magnetic field
freaks him out...

372
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,000
but if you can get
past that barrier,

373
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,208
that'll be a sign of a
real bond between you!

374
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,666
"Horrible boy...

375
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,916
Does he think he can
get away with that...?

376
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,916
One simply does not use a kitten
to play catch." Misaka says,

377
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,666
talking to herself
under her breath.

378
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,000
[meow]

379
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,000
Is that an
upset meow?

380
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,916
[meow]

381
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,541
Or a happy one...?

382
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,041
How do I tell them apart?

383
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,041
[yelling]

384
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,625
We were out of line.
We're sorry man.

385
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,166
We get the message.
You don't need to--

386
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,666
Oh, come on...

387
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,958
You were the ones who started
it in the first place.

388
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,208
You don't really think

389
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,333
you're going to get off
with an apology, do you?

390
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,541
[PUNK 12-B] It hurts!
It hurts...! It hurts!

391
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,666
Please, just stop! Ahh!

392
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,625
[PUNK 12-C yells]

393
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,875
Pathetic...

394
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,125
I know about ten thousand
girls who can take

395
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,833
much worse than that without
so much as a whimper.

396
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,166
No, please!

397
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,750
[ACCELERATOR]
Hey, help a guy out.

398
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,083
I gotta work up an appetite
for dinner somehow.

399
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,166
[ACCELERATOR sighs]

400
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,875
Yeah... I guess it is about
that time again, isn't it?

401
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,125
Lucky you.

402
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,250
It looks like you get to
live for another day.

403
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,000
[MISAKA 10031]
Thank you for waiting.

404
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,500
"I hope I have
not kept you long...

405
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:46,791
I am Misaka 10031, your next
opponent," Misaka reports.

406
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,625
Tch... okay...

407
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,208
You guys get kinda'
confusing after awhile.

408
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,625
"Should I apologize for your
confusion?" asks Misaka.

409
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,458
[ACCELERATOR] I don't need
an apology from somebody

410
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,791
who'll be dead before tomorrow.

411
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,041
[MISAKA 10032]
Operation confirmed.

412
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:09,291
Misakas 10031 and
10032 will proceed

413
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,708
with the predetermined
course of action.

414
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,791
[meows]

415
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,625
[MIKOTO] This is strange...

416
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,875
There isn't a hint
of anyone here.

417
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,208
If the sensors
weren't working,

418
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,625
the cameras probably
aren't, either.

419
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,791
[MIKOTO] This facility
is the end-all be-all,

420
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,375
the point of communication
with Academy City's brain.

421
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,750
[MIKOTO] But here I am.

422
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,041
Moving around unimpeded
after getting past

423
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,791
their meager display
of exterior security.

424
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,041
Have they fled...?

425
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,708
Is this a trap?

426
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:00,250
Whatever the case, there
should be more to it than this.

427
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,625
How do they benefit from
letting me get this far in?

428
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,666
Are they just that sure

429
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,791
that hacking into the
system is impossible?

430
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,958
Even the control
room is deserted.

431
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,416
The facility appears
to be functioning...

432
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,583
But...

433
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,791
This didn't
just happen...

434
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,958
The utter emptiness, the layer
of dust coating everything.

435
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,208
This place has been
abandoned for awhile.

436
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,625
But why?

437
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,125
This is nothing like
what I expected.

438
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:43,583
I'll do what I came here
for and--Is this it?

439
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,291
What does that mean?

440
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,916
Number of transmissions
today: 0...?

441
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,541
There should be several
hundred requests

442
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,666
to Tree Diagram each day.

443
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,250
No... the requests are here.

444
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,500
They just haven't
been processed...

445
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,708
Nor were yesterday's,
or the day before...

446
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,541
[MIKOTO] These are reports.

447
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,833
A bunch of them ...

448
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,791
23rd Report... 24th Report...

449
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,291
What does that say?!

450
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,958
"This is the final
report regarding

451
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,208
the disappearance
of Tree Diagram."

452
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:27,083
"On June 28 at zero
zero twenty hours,

453
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,458
all communications
ceased and Tree Diagram

454
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,500
disappeared from
its satellite track.

455
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,666
That same day,
at zero one fifteen,

456
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,833
Search Party 1 was dispatched."

457
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,750
"Later, at zero three forty,

458
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,916
one section of Tree Diagram's
remnants was recovered...

459
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,125
Analysis indicates that
Tree Diagram was...

460
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,875
Tree Diagram...

461
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,875
...no longer exists.

462
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,750
Then...

463
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,666
[KAMIJO] Let's see here...

464
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,458
Cat book...
cat book... cat book...

465
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,625
[meows]

466
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,458
[MIKOTO] Tree Diagram
doesn't exist.

467
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,875
[MISAKA 10031]
The experiments continue.

468
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,583
[MIKOTO] There must be something
I can do to save them!

469
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,666
[MISAKA 10031] "Misaka must go
on to the next experiment,"

470
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,458
says Misaka.

471
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:58,458
[MIKOTO] Stop...! Please!
