1
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,625
[ARITOMI] The idealist
will say...

2
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,958
No man has inherent superiority.

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,083
That we are, all of us,
beings of equal worth.

4
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,250
While the spiritualist
will argue...

5
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,541
No effort goes unrewarded.

6
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,500
So, endeavor we must...

7
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,791
For, it is the process
itself that is important.

8
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:48,041
[scattered applause]

9
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,958
[ARITOMI] Of course...
all of that's a lie.

10
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,833
Every child learns one thing
quickly, living in this city...

11
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,958
It doesn't matter
how much you study...

12
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,416
or how great of a
thesis you produce...

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,541
In this city, you're either
an esper or you're neglected.

14
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,041
A person's ability
determines their worth...

15
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,416
their standing ...

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,541
It is the one and
only benchmark.

17
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:17,083
However, abilities are
such unpredictable things...

18
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,166
They're affected by
one's innate qualities,

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,083
and only in the rarest instance
is a high-level esper produced,

20
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,958
yet they are an important
part of our social structure.

21
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,125
So, you see...

22
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,541
I could not help
thinking to myself...

23
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,541
What if I could create
my own esper...?

24
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,625
I could use an approach
that differs completely

25
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,125
from the existing methods.

26
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,500
I could design an esper that was
both stable and consistent...

27
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,333
but because it was
artificially produced

28
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:46,375
would not be too valuable
to be quickly used up.

29
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,291
So I collaborated with a few
like-minded individuals,

30
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,708
and together we bent our minds
to developing a certain project.

31
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,583
One that would allow
us to create an esper

32
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,291
with absolute certainty.

33
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,541
"Project Chemicaloid" was born.

34
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,750
[MIKOTO] And that project...

35
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,583
It produced Febri
and her sister...

36
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,875
They exist because of
your petty ambitions.

37
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,958
Heh... Yes, you
would say that...

38
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,291
Like most people in this city,

39
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,458
you are entrenched
in ability Levelism.

40
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,083
I've dealt with your kind.

41
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,875
What do you mean?

42
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,500
You see... I have
presented this project

43
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,916
to people with skills
like yours before...

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,666
skills that would be
necessary for a chemicaloid.

45
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,541
[SAKURAI] How is it someone
from the underground

46
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,125
is so short-sighted...?

47
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,791
You would think they would see
the potential in our proposal.

48
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,958
[MALE RESEARCHER 23-A] I'm glad
you made it here safely.

49
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,208
Now we can finally implement
Project Level 6 Shift

50
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,916
on the scale that we had
originally planned for it.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,208
[ARITOMI] Ah! Is that...
Dr. Gensei Kihara?

52
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,000
[MALE RESEARCHER 23-A] I have
to admit I began to sweat

53
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,833
when I heard there
was some competition.

54
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,458
Oh, was there...?

55
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,708
Ah...! You mean the one
where they wanted to

56
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,375
grow espers like sea-monkeys?

57
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,458
From that I learned
a valuable lesson...

58
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,291
Even famous intellectual minds

59
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:37,458
can be clouded by an outdated
obsession with esper Levelism.

60
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:42,000
Revolutionary ideas are always
initially suspect, after all.

61
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,500
To be recognized we would
have to prove ourselves

62
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,041
on intellect alone...

63
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,000
and so we produced what
we said we would all along.

64
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,583
Chemicaloids.

65
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,500
Products that would
prove our worth...

66
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,166
our true superiority...

67
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,125
to this city...

68
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,500
indeed, to the whole world!

69
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,291
So... what is it about
these chemicaloids

70
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,500
that proves how
superior you are...?

71
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,500
What ability do your
"products" have?

72
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,083
[ARITOMI] Trying to draw
information out of me...?

73
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,208
Now, now, I've already given
you a good number of clues.

74
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,125
[MIKOTO] Remote operation...

75
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,750
With a strand of hair
acting as a medium.

76
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:18,166
Well... that's part of it,
but certainly not all...

77
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,208
Nice effort, though, Railgun.

78
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,750
Want to know more...?

79
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,125
Well... You will...

80
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,416
After much waiting,
at day break tomorrow,

81
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,250
we will begin our large-scale
chemicaloid experiment.

82
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,708
Experiment?

83
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,958
[ARITOMI] No...

84
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,833
that word really isn't
big enough anymore...

85
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,500
Allow me to revise.

86
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,958
Revolution...!

87
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,875
STUDY Corporation will turn
Academy City on it's head!

88
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,916
We will teach this
wretched city...

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No...! We will teach
the whole world a lesson!

90
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,916
Ultimately, progress is not
brought about by abilities...

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,166
but by intelligence!

92
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,583
[MIKOTO] I...

93
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,583
feel...

94
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,333
[MIKOTO] Is that the time...

95
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,958
really?

96
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,083
[NUNOTABA] Don't bother
trying to move.

97
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,500
Only your eyes and
your mouth will respond.

98
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,333
Your body is paralyzed.

99
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,916
It's because
of the drug...

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,583
the one I injected you with...

101
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,166
It blocks the transmission of
commands to your nervous system.

102
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,333
You won't be able to move
a finger for two more hours yet.

103
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,208
So... I'm curious...

104
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,583
How did you... get involved
with these people?

105
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,583
I remember what you said.

106
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,125
You talked to me before
about my sisters...

107
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,125
about how you stopped
seeing them as things

108
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,708
and were trying to shut down
the experiments...

109
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,250
After all that...

110
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,041
why get mixed up in
something like this?

111
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,041
During the Sisters case,
I made a mistake.

112
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,750
I was caught by an
underground organization.

113
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,500
And then... I was sold.

114
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,625
To STUDY.

115
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,416
That's when I was introduced to
the artificially created twins.

116
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,041
Their names were
Janie and Febri.

117
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,125
The involuntary neural activity

118
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,916
essential to keeping
them alive...

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,250
what you might call
their core programming...

120
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,000
was based on a thesis that
I had written a long time ago.

121
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,166
[NUNOTABA] That particular sin

122
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,791
is one for which I will
never be forgiven...

123
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,375
It will follow me
my entire life.

124
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,541
Even so...

125
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,250
I must keep trying...

126
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,416
I must atone by helping in
whatever way is possible...

127
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,916
That was all I could think...
when I saw those girls.

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,041
Janie...

129
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,208
That's Febri's sister...

130
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,625
She only has enough programming
language installed

131
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:38,125
to allow her Diffusion Ghost
core to function properly.

132
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,750
[MIKOTO] Diffusion Ghost?

133
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,333
[NUNOTABA] That is
Janie's ability...

134
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,041
I'd planned to give
her consciousness

135
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,000
comparable to that
of a normal girl...

136
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,458
I'd get my hands on
the neutralizing agent...

137
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,708
and then I would
run away with her.

138
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,208
But now...

139
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,958
Things have gone too far...
and that isn't possible.

140
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,458
I have to get the
formula from Aritomi.

141
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,666
That's the only choice,

142
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,541
since he's the one
who came up with it...

143
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,875
I'll do whatever I have
to go get it from him.

144
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,666
[MIKOTO] Yes. I see.

145
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,916
[NUNOTABA] I don't care
what happens to me...

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,291
I will save those girls...

147
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,541
no matter the cost.

148
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,125
[MIKOTO] I get it...

149
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,625
I understand her guilt.

150
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,041
Hey...

151
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,291
[NUNOTABA] I know what
I've done is unforgivable--

152
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,416
[MIKOTO] My sister never
got the chance, but...

153
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,000
she wanted to tell you thanks.

154
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,416
You think you have to
do this by yourself...

155
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,750
but if you take a look around,

156
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,958
I think you'll realize
you're wrong...

157
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,416
You're not alone...

158
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,875
There are people out
there who want to help you

159
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,583
if you'll let them.

160
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,166
[NUNOTABA] And you're one of
those people I suppose...?

161
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,666
But how do you think you
can help me right now...?

162
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,666
You're effectively paralyzed...

163
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,416
Thanks to me, the only thing
you can move is your mouth!

164
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,166
[MIKOTO] Oh, really?
Just my mouth... huh?

165
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,416
How can you...?

166
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,791
[NUNOTABA] Incredible!

167
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,041
She's using her ability
to directly control

168
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,708
the electrical signals
that run to her nerves!

169
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,250
[MIKOTO groans]

170
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,625
[MIKOTO] I've never
tried this before.

171
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,333
But, hey... it seems to
work pretty well, huh?

172
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,375
[NUNOTABA] Doing something
like that should be causing

173
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,125
intense pain throughout
her entire body.

174
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,041
[MIKOTO] Let me tell you what
I've come to realize recently...

175
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,708
Other people count on you...

176
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,750
but you can count
on them, too...

177
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,541
If you work with someone
instead of on your own,

178
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,791
your combined strength can
make all the difference.

179
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,083
You know...

180
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,208
when I first found out
about my sisters...

181
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,541
I reacted the
same way you are...

182
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,875
I just kept thinking...

183
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,000
"This is my fault.
I have to do something."

184
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,291
However...

185
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,333
It took a while, but
I've finally stopped

186
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,458
thinking like that...
Which is why--

187
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,000
[explosion]

188
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:44,958
[MIKOTO] Here they come.

189
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,083
[NUNOTABA] Huh?

190
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,000
[alarm sounds]

191
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,625
[ARITOMI] Hey!
What's going on?

192
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,750
More intruders...

193
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,541
The guard robots
are down.

194
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,583
[KUROKO] Uiharu...

195
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,625
I've got the entrance
under my control.

196
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,458
You're certain there are
no civilians in the area?

197
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes, the coast is clear...

198
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,666
You can do whatever
you need to...

199
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,541
Come in, Saten.
What's the status outside?

200
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,750
[SATEN] It's all good...

201
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,166
No suspicious activity so far.

202
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,958
[NUNOTABA] How did they
know where to find you?

203
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,666
[MIKOTO] I borrowed one of those
implantable tracking devices

204
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,458
they use when you go
outside of Academy City.

205
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,625
And then...

206
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,791
I talked it over
with my friends.

207
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,666
I told them if I
was gone too long,

208
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,000
they should come and get me.

209
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,416
You actually dragged your
friends into this mess--

210
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,750
[MIKOTO] No.

211
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,000
I explained the
situation to them...

212
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,750
and then I asked.
I asked for help.

213
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,875
And without hesitation,
they agreed...

214
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,666
They care about Febri, too.

215
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,083
Although... it looks like
Febri may need more help

216
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,333
than my friends
and I can give.

217
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,833
So now I'm
asking you...

218
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,625
Do you think you can
help us save her?

219
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,708
But this is all my fault.
You can't trust me.

220
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,958
[MIKOTO] Yes I can.

221
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,333
I trust you completely.

222
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,250
Look--

223
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,166
[NUNOTABA]
No, this is all wrong...

224
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,083
you shouldn't be saying that.

225
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm the one who should
be asking you...

226
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,291
So, now I am...

227
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,666
I'm asking...
Please help us!

228
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,208
[MIKOTO] Kuroko!

229
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,458
[KUROKO] Hi, Sissy!

230
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,708
[MIKOTO] Ah--Hold on.
You don't want to--

231
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,916
Ahh!

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,125
How cruel...!

233
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,666
I came to help and you
repay me like this?!

234
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,500
I'm... sorry...
It's kind of a long story,

235
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,625
but basically I'm going
to be a human stun gun

236
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,500
for a little while.

237
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,958
Huh?

238
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,750
[MIKOTO] Anyway... I think
we've worn out our welcome.

239
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,208
[KUROKO] What's going on?

240
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,166
I'll explain soon enough.

241
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,166
Let's get out of here.

242
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,166
[ARITOMI] She regained
all motor function

243
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,083
after a full dose of the drug...

244
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,625
Incredible.

245
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,291
It seems she's every bit
as strong as we'd heard.

246
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,875
So... what are you
still doing here...?

247
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,333
Why didn't you run away?

248
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,875
What choice did I have...?

249
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,625
Everybody knows my history--

250
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,458
that I was sold to
your corporation.

251
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,875
If I ran, then the entire
underworld would be after me.

252
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,250
In this town, that's as
good as a death sentence.

253
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,875
So, you stayed out of
fear rather than loyalty...

254
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,416
That's not surprising...

255
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,000
It's just as well, however.
If you weren't here to assist,

256
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:13,625
we'd have to resort to
the whip when using Janie.

257
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,625
The only place you have left is
here in the darkness with STUDY.

258
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,916
For your own good, I do hope
you'll keep that in mind.

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,291
[MIKOTO] Are you sure
you want to stay?

260
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,958
[NUNOTABA]
Aritomi is cautious...

261
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,708
He doesn't want
to be discovered...

262
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,958
He's relocated
Janie someplace else.

263
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,708
If I leave, we won't be able
to find out where she is now.

264
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,541
But you...

265
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,541
Don't worry about me.

266
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,083
I still have at least
a little value to them...

267
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,125
They won't dispose
of me right away...

268
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,458
I just have to bide my time...

269
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,000
I'll find out where
their base is

270
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,083
and I'll get the
formula we need.

271
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,708
Just be careful.

272
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,291
Anyway... about
what Aritomi said...

273
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,583
He mentioned something was
going to happen tomorrow.

274
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,458
What's that all about,
do you know?

275
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,041
They haven't given me
any of the details...

276
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,125
But like he said, they do
have something planned.

277
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,625
Tomorrow.

278
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,750
[KONORI] A terrorist attack
at the Reach Assembly sites?

279
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,333
Yes...

280
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,458
Actually, the word he used to
describe it was "revolution."

281
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,958
That sounds crazy!

282
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,541
These guys
mean business...

283
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,625
They have Febri's sister, Janie,
and they plan on using her.

284
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,833
Or, at any rate...
they'll use Janie's ability.

285
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:17,291
[UIHARU] Huh?!

286
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,458
No way!

287
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,333
Sorry, but did you
say "Diffusion Ghost"

288
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,666
was the name
of her ability?

289
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,791
[NUNOTABA] Her ability is
called "Diffusion Ghost,"

290
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,833
and it requires
hair for a medium...

291
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,750
With it, she is able to convert
the AIM diffusion fields

292
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,916
in an enclosed space
into virtual matter

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,583
and achieve control.

294
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,916
[MIKOTO] In other words,
those empty powered suits

295
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,083
and the berserk security
robots were controlled

296
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:43,208
in the same way... With Janie...
And her strange ability.

297
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,416
This use of AIM fields
sounds familiar to me.

298
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,000
Like what Dr. Kiyama
did that one time.

299
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,416
[SATEN] You understand this?

300
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,458
[UIHARU] Kind of...

301
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,541
I do think I've seen it--

302
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,916
[KUROKO] Let's think...

303
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,750
With operating
system abilities,

304
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,166
there is a limit
to how many things

305
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,625
can be controlled at once...

306
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,625
This isn't really suited
for a large-scale attack.

307
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,875
[MIKOTO] Okay, but...

308
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,833
they did say that a number
of simple commands

309
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,583
are placed ahead
of time into the fields

310
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,291
that Janie
virtually materializes...

311
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,375
For example...

312
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,291
"Eliminate any opponent
who attacks."

313
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,583
Something like that.

314
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,833
So, basically...

315
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,041
it's like having a bunch
of autonomous robots

316
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,208
on hand, right?

317
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,541
If all this is true...

318
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,791
a large-scale attack
wouldn't be impossible.

319
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,458
Febri's sister.

320
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,791
Do you know where STUDY
has been keeping Janie...?

321
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,041
If we stop her, they
can't launch an attack!

322
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,458
Well, yeah,
that's true...

323
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,625
but this Nunotaba woman I
mentioned to you before...

324
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,583
she wasn't told what the base
for the attack was going to be.

325
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,291
Oh, no...

326
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,166
[MIKOTO] Once Janie
uses her ability,

327
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,416
Nunotaba thinks Febri
will be able to give us

328
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,541
an idea of her
sister's location,

329
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,375
or at least the direction
of where to start looking.

330
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,958
That's all well
and good, but...

331
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,625
If she's used
her ability,

332
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,541
doesn't that mean that
we are already too late?

333
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,166
If we're going
to forestall this,

334
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,458
the best thing to do would be to
pursue the powered suit angle.

335
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,041
There must be quite a number
of them currently deployed

336
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,500
in the area around the
Reach Assembly site...

337
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,583
Uiharu... look that up?

338
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,625
I have more parameters to
apply to the search now...

339
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,208
I think I can do it!

340
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,791
Hey, you know...

341
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,875
with all this new information,
Antiskill might be able to act.

342
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,250
You're right!

343
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,500
[YOMIKAWA] I'm sorry,
I really am.

344
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,583
But I don't think Antiskill can
get involved in this case.

345
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,458
[KUROKO] But why not?

346
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,666
[YOMIKAWA] The STUDY
Corporation, huh?

347
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,916
Now that I hear that name,

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,416
things are starting
to make sense.

349
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,583
They're fairly new...

350
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,166
but they've quickly
risen to prominence,

351
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,458
forcing out the competition

352
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,708
to become our
equipment suppliers...

353
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,541
Their swift ascent has
been bothering me...

354
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,333
but, I guess this explains it.

355
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,125
Mm. Ya' know, for that matter,

356
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,583
it explains why I was
suddenly suspended, too.

357
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,625
[KUROKO] Suspended?!

358
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,083
[SATEN] Are you all right?

359
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,333
[YOMIKAWA] Yeah.

360
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,666
I'm weathering the storm
at a friend's place...

361
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,625
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

362
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,291
I'm a lot more worried
about you guys.

363
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,750
Don't do anything crazy.

364
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,333
[KONORI] The situation is even
more dire than we first thought.

365
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,708
[UIHARU] I've got it!

366
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,208
The record of STUDY
Corporation's bulk containers

367
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,083
and the sites they have
been delivered to.

368
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,916
They made it into the
sites...? How could they--

369
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,041
[UIHARU] Well, look.

370
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,250
It says here that
there was a blackout

371
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,666
at each site during delivery,

372
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,083
and all of their records
appear to be incomplete.

373
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,250
Blackouts! Of course!

374
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,916
And now we know the
reason behind them.

375
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,125
How many are we
talking about?

376
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,583
Give me a second.
I'm tallying them now.

377
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,916
[KONGO] Bad news, ladies!

378
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,458
I finally got a hold of
some relevant information

379
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,833
using my father's channels...

380
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,125
When you add up...

381
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,791
Approximating by container
capacity and contents...

382
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,791
...you've got enough to
build a truly incredible

383
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,083
number of powered suits!

384
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,750
No way!
That's so many!

385
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,625
The number has to be--

386
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,291
[UIHARU] Over 20,000!

387
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,291
[KONGO] I beg your pardon?

388
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,791
Impossible...

389
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,833
[UIHARU] The thing is...

390
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,083
Since they went through official
channels to deliver the suits

391
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,708
to all of the various sites...

392
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,875
we can't take any action
without Antiskill's cooperation.

393
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,041
If we do, there's a good
chance we'd be arrested.

394
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,625
Essentially... it doesn't
sound like there's a whole lot

395
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,625
we can do until they
make their move.

396
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,625
Then we have to find this Janie
girl and stop her somehow.

397
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,083
Yes, except... we have
no way of knowing

398
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,708
where she is until she
activates her ability.

399
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,333
Which means we'll have to
allow the attack to begin.

400
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,458
[SATEN] That's crazy!

401
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,500
[MIKOTO]
We're totally unprepared...

402
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,291
These guys are light
years ahead of us.

403
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,666
All this time...

404
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,041
they've been getting
ready for a coup.

405
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,416
[UIHARU] If they get
out into the city,

406
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,208
who knows how much
damage they'll do?

407
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,416
What's on your mind?

408
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Please tell us.

409
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,375
[MIKOTO] I just want
to save Febri...

410
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,458
and her sister, Janie as well...

411
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,125
I want to save Nunotaba,

412
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,875
who, right now, is still
embedded with the enemy ...

413
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:47,125
And, of course, I want to
protect Academy City.

414
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,625
I also...

415
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,000
I want to keep every single
one of you out of danger...

416
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,458
So, I wonder...
am I just being selfish?

417
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,166
[KONGO] Well, if you are--

418
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,375
If that's the case, then I have
to admit I'm selfish, too.

419
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,000
Mm-Hm. And actually...
I may be worse...

420
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,458
because I want all of that,
and on top of it,

421
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,333
I want you to stop
looking so miserable.

422
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,791
[KUROKO] Saten is right.

423
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,958
Even when things are going
as well as they can...

424
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,708
you still seem to find something
to worry about, Sissy...

425
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:20,208
It makes it hard for the rest
of us to really relax, you know?

426
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,458
That's true...

427
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,125
Cheer up. We can do this
if we all work together.

428
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,250
Exactly...!

429
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,208
Together, there's
nothing we can't do!

430
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,416
I-I believe so, as well...

431
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,750
We are unstoppable.

432
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,250
It won't be easy...

433
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,041
but when this is
finally over...

434
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,583
...we'll still be standing,
shoulder to shoulder.

435
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,250
We'll have a happy
ending, you'll see!

436
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,708
[KAMIJO] I know you
have your own goals...

437
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:55,166
Mine is seeing everybody
get through this alive.

438
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,500
Heh. I know what you mean.

439
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,000
Now it's my goal too.

440
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,083
[GROUP] Uh?

441
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,291
Oh, hi...
Everybody's here.

442
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,291
[MIKOTO] Yes, Febri...

443
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,708
...we are all here...

444
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,000
and we're about to go and
see if we can help Janie.

445
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,083
Would you like to come, too?

446
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,708
[FEBRI] Yeah!

447
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:17,625
[MIKOTO] Heh.

448
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,541
[phone rings]

449
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,041
[KONORI] Oh, Aomi?

450
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,833
Sorry to be calling you so late.

451
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,416
[AOMI] That's okay.

452
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,083
If you're the one calling, well,
I know there's a good reason,

453
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,916
no matter how late it might be.

454
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,416
So, spill.

455
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,833
All right. Tell me...

456
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,333
What do you think
about this city?

457
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,750
[AOMI] Huh?

458
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,750
[KONGO] Thank you, Father,
I really appreciate this.

459
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,166
Okay... I'll leave
you to it, then.

460
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,958
Heh. Well, you heard her.

461
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,250
Let's indulge my daughter.

462
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,208
You'll see to everything...
right, Pops?

463
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,791
[FEBRI] Oh, hot! Hot! Hot!

464
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:55,833
All done!

465
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,833
[UIHARU] Wow!
That's very pretty!

466
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,083
I'm gonna save it so
my sister can eat it.

467
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,708
That's so sweet ...

468
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,583
And how is it going over there?

469
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,333
Hmm. I'm not sure
how well it's going,

470
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,333
but I'm not giving up anytime
soon, I promise that much!

471
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,041
--[FEBRI] Hang in there!
--[SATEN] You bet!

472
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,083
[UIHARU] Okay! We'll keep
working hard, too, right, Febri?

473
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,083
[door opens]

474
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,083
[MIKOTO]
That's refreshing! Ahh...

475
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,791
[KUROKO] I've got everything all
ready to go over here, too.

476
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,125
This should make a good decoy

477
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,666
in case the head resident
comes barging in here.

478
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,250
[MIKOTO] Wait.

479
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,541
This only makes it look like one
of us is sleeping, doesn't it?

480
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,708
And this side is too big...

481
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,958
See... they are sleeping...
in each other's arms!

482
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,166
[thud] Oww!

483
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,875
Aww. But I had them
positioned just right.

484
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,125
[MIKOTO] Good grief.

485
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,208
We can at least try to
make it look realistic.

486
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,416
If we get found out,
we're both in for it.

487
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,333
Let's see...

488
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,875
[KUROKO] Hey, Sissy...

489
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,000
What's this?

490
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,500
It's a four-leaf clover.

491
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,000
Huh?

492
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:58,541
It's a good-luck charm that
I picked especially for you.

493
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,041
Thanks a lot.

494
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,250
[KUROKO] By the way...

495
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,541
Who was that you called earlier?

496
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,750
[MIKOTO] Oh... Just someone.

497
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,291
[MADARAME] Ten minutes
remaining to sunrise.

498
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,333
It has been a long
night, indeed.

499
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,583
But, at last...

500
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,791
we are about to see the
dawning of a new day.

501
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,791
All systems are prepped
and ready to go.

502
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,041
All that remains is
to activate them.

503
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,625
Janie has reached
critical phase, as well...

504
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:29,125
It's almost as if she's aware of
her own role in what's to come.

505
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,750
[NUNOTABA] Almost time...

506
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,208
What I have planned may
work, and it may not...

507
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:37,208
Either way, it won't
absolve my sin.

508
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,208
But... even so...

509
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,375
I resolve to do whatever I can.

510
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,000
[ARITOMI] Now then.
Time for final confirmation...

511
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,375
Those in favor or proceeding
as we have planned?

512
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,750
Okay, we're ready...

513
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,500
Let us begin our Silent Party.

514
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:01,000
[MIKOTO] You know, you look
very nice in that outfit.

515
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,958
Is that the present
Kongo bought for you?

516
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,208
[FEBRI] Mm-Hmm. It's pretty,

517
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,500
and it reminds me of
the one from before.

518
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,875
One from before?

519
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:12,625
From Shinobu...
She picked it out for me.

520
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,583
Oh?

521
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,750
Well...

522
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,791
It's time now.

523
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,625
All right!

524
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,666
You will not be taking...

525
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,000
[KONGO]
...one tiny little step...

526
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,500
[AWATSUKI and WANNAI]
...beyond this point.

527
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,541
You... you go right ahead...

528
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,333
... and give us the
best you've got to give!

529
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:01,541
[FEBRI gasps]

530
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,833
That way...!

531
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,333
My sister--

532
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,000
[MIKOTO] Here.
Don't forget this.

533
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,666
[MIKOTO] This is our last shot.

534
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,708
[MIKOTO] Up you go...

535
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,458
I need you to trust me, okay?

536
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:21,833
[FEBRI] Aaaahhhhh!

537
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,333
[MIKOTO] Right... Here we go!

538
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,708
[MIKOTO] To protect
Academy City...

539
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,125
[UIHARU] To save
Janie and Febri...

540
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,583
[KUROKO
...and Nunotaba, too.

541
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,208
[SATEN] For a happy
ending for all of us!

542
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,583
[MIKOTO] That's why
we're fighting...

543
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,375
[GROUP] To make
that dream come true!
