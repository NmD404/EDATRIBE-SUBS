1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,958
[MIKOTO] I can't believe this...

2
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,333
My path crossing
with hers again?!

3
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:28,458
[THERESTINA] No, you are all
my lab rats, don't you see?

4
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,083
Would you prefer
a different analogy...?

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,000
Very well, Academy City
is my breeding farm,

6
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,333
and all you children
are my livestock.

7
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,625
[MIKOTO] But right now...

8
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,625
This woman could hold
the key to saving Febri.

9
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,875
[THERESTINA] Hmm...
Long time no see, huh?

10
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,166
How I've missed you,
my little lab rat.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,083
[MIKOTO] Therestina...
Kihara Lifeline.

12
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,666
Ahhh!

13
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,500
Hey, aren't you gonna swim?

14
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,791
[MUGINO] Yeah... maybe later.

15
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,166
[phone rings]

16
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,083
Jeez.
Are you okay?

17
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,166
[TAKITSUBO] Hmm?

18
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,416
[FRENDA] Ahhhh,
this feels fantastic!

19
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,125
[MUGINO] Huh...?!
What are you talking about?!

20
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,541
[FEMALE VOICE 8-A] It's a
question of saving face.

21
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,875
Given what happened,

22
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,041
we can't just sit back and
do nothing, you know...

23
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,166
If we don't act,
and soon, we're ruined.

24
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,125
[MUGINO] Getting taken in by...

25
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,083
Don't you wanna
swim around?

26
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,333
Floating is fun.

27
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,958
[MUGINO] 
...clean up your mess?

28
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,500
[FEMALE VOICE 8-A] Oh,
get off your high horse...

29
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,291
I told you you were
going to get paid,

30
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,666
so stop your complaining...

31
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,791
Besides, weren't you the one
who said you were pissed

32
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,791
about being tricked?

33
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,666
Tch. We can get
rowdy if we want?

34
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,958
[FEMALE VOICE 8-A]
Go right ahead.

35
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,708
[FRENDA] What's
the call about...?

36
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,958
More work?

37
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,208
[MUGINO] Yeah.
Can't say I'm excited, though.

38
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,000
Hope you ladies are ready
to work up a sweat.

39
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,500
[THERESTINA] Hmm...

40
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,791
[MIKOTO] Yeah, what?

41
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,333
Your face is looking
more grown-up these days.

42
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,750
You seen your fill
of darkness yet...?

43
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,333
Has this city
made you jaded?

44
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,833
So, how did
it happen...?

45
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,750
Something hit too
close to home...

46
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,416
and you
investigated...

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,333
You went seeking
the source...

48
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,416
and you
found darkness.

49
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,666
[THERESTINA]
Then at long last...

50
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,333
you realized that what I
said was correct all along.

51
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,541
Academy City is
one big test site...

52
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,791
and all the students
inside it are lab rats.

53
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,250
Well? What did you
want to ask...?

54
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,416
Or did you come here
seeking the comfort of one

55
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
who knows the truth, as well?

56
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,250
I want to help a friend...
to save her.

57
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,750
Huh?

58
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,750
[MIKOTO] Her name is Febri...

59
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,583
She's a little girl who
was artificially created...

60
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,875
If I do nothing...

61
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,708
she is going to die
within seventy-two hours.

62
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,916
I'm here for her sake...

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,625
I know an underground
organization is responsible

64
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,958
for making her.

65
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,166
Given your connections,

66
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,375
I thought you might
know something about--

67
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,958
Oh, come on.
Don't you learn?

68
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,000
What is it going to take...?

69
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,625
You got a whole heap of
your own clones killed,

70
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:35,250
and you still get all mushy
about some girl you barely know?

71
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,250
This kid, whatever her name is,

72
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:41,166
she's just one more lab rat
spawned by this city.

73
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,875
You wanna survive
in this town...?

74
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,291
Give in to the darkness
and live like livestock...

75
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,791
or become one of the
people in charge...

76
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,250
Because those are the only two
options you have in this place.

77
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,708
[MIKOTO] That isn't true.

78
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,958
I've seen it.

79
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,083
I know the darkness that
you're talking about...

80
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,583
At first I felt
lost and hopeless...

81
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,916
desperate and destructive.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,291
But you know...

83
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,416
It was the people I
met in Academy City

84
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
who wound up saving
me from myself.

85
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,041
I'm not alone.

86
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,916
I have a group of friends
who are dear to me...

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,708
and if it weren't
for this city...

88
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,125
I never would have
met any of them.

89
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,666
There are a lot of things that
disgust me about this place...

90
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,875
but even so...

91
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,708
I can't bring myself
to hate it like you do.

92
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,291
[THERESTINA] Heh.

93
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:33,000
I've heard enough...
You can go now.

94
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,583
[MIKOTO] No, I can't.

95
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,833
Not until you answer me.

96
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,291
Who was it that created Febri?

97
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,583
[THERESTINA] How should I know?

98
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,000
[MIKOTO] What is
their objective...

99
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,958
What is this?

100
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,750
You must know!
Please tell me!

101
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,583
[THERESTINA] And what if I lie?

102
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,416
What possible motivation
could I have

103
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,041
for answering you honestly?

104
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,500
You and I have a history...

105
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,416
Can you really
believe what I say?

106
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,625
[MIKOTO] Yes.

107
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,625
I'll believe you.

108
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,166
Why is that?

109
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,250
Because right now it's
the only choice I have.

110
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,250
Hold out your hand.

111
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,708
Well, aren't you
going to eat it...?

112
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,541
It's just ordinary chocolate...

113
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,166
Nothing sinister about it.

114
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,333
What's the matter...?

115
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,333
Eat up.

116
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,375
You believe me, right?

117
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,916
I said I'd believe
you, didn't I?

118
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,041
Go away.

119
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,083
I'm staying...!

120
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,541
Now tell me about Febri.

121
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,750
You're wasting
your time.

122
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,125
I don't have
anything to tell you.

123
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,333
I'm not going anywhere
until you answer!

124
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,250
[THERESTINA] No, thanks.
I'm done talking.

125
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,708
[MIKOTO] Tell me about Febri!

126
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,333
What do you have to lose...?

127
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,458
Please, tell me!

128
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,583
[THERESTINA] Ugh,
you are such a pain.

129
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,541
Chemicaloid.

130
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,458
If I'm remembering correctly,
that's what they called it.

131
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,958
[MIKOTO] Called what...?

132
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,666
You mean a chemicaloid
is what Febri is?

133
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,625
[THERESTINA] At the time,
of course,

134
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,333
it was all just theoretical...

135
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,750
But those boys must have found
some way of making it happen.

136
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,000
These "boys" are the ones
who made Febri, then...?

137
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,416
Well, what was their objective?

138
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,833
[THERESTINA] Hmph. Beats me.

139
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,833
It's probably their
elaborate way of getting

140
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,125
their existence noticed.

141
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,666
Getting noticed?

142
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,333
[THERESTINA] There's
some kind of fancy event

143
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,875
coming up, isn't there?

144
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,083
[MIKOTO] An event... Uh...

145
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,375
The Reach Assembly!

146
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,250
They had to artificially
create a person

147
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,250
in order to get attention?!
That doesn't make any--

148
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,750
[THERESTINA]
Doesn't make any sense?

149
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,125
[THERESTINA laughs]

150
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,458
Oh, yes, that's good.
Spoken like a true Level 5.

151
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,708
[MIKOTO] Huh?

152
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,541
[THERESTINA] Don't you
understand, little girl?

153
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,625
Here in Academy City, you are
one of the privileged elite...

154
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,000
Pin on your Level 5 tag, and
even a pathetic lab rat like you

155
00:07:56,083 --> 00:08:01,500
will have plenty of dear friends
flocking eagerly to your side.

156
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,458
Don't think for a second
that you understand

157
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,041
the true darkness
of those who lack

158
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,291
even your status in this city...

159
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,958
At the end of the day,
you know nothing.

160
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
Stupid brat!

161
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,291
[UIHARU] What?

162
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,291
You actually met with
that witch Therestina?!

163
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,958
Yeah... sorry...

164
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,291
It happened so rapidly

165
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,708
there was no time to
tell you guys about it.

166
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,125
So, according to her,

167
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,208
"chemicaloid" is the official
term for what Febri is?

168
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,583
[KONORI] And the
people who created her

169
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,333
are planning to do something
at the Reach Assembly?

170
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,666
She didn't say that exactly.
I just put it together...

171
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,291
That strange guy Kongo saw...

172
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,666
the one who was
talking on the phone

173
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,416
about "retrieving" Febri...

174
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,416
he was at one of the Reach
Assembly campuses, right?

175
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,791
Therestina mentioned an
event that's coming up...

176
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,250
I'm guessing that's it.

177
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,541
I'm still confused...

178
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,583
It was the hospital doctor
who arranged it...?

179
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,708
It was his idea for you to
ask Therestina about this?

180
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,958
[SATEN] There's something
about that guy's face...

181
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,208
What's his role in
all this, anyway?

182
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,958
There is something else
he told me that I think

183
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,000
all of you should know.

184
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,791
What's that,
Sissy?

185
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,500
[MIKOTO] He made some
calculations based on

186
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,041
the number of lollipops
Febri had with her.

187
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,541
Without more, she only
has seventy-two hours.

188
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,583
To live...?! Oh, no!
That's all...?

189
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,750
Three days
isn't very long.

190
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,541
[SATEN]
Uiharu?

191
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,708
I'm going to screen everyone
who's involved in the Assembly.

192
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,083
Administrators...
participating students...

193
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,000
That's a good idea.

194
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,208
Hey there, sleepy head.

195
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,250
Hello...

196
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,458
[door opens]

197
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,416
[KONGO] Good afternoon!

198
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,833
How is everyone?

199
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,375
We brought something
I think you ladies

200
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,500
will be excited about.

201
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,541
Oh, really?!

202
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,208
Were you finally
able to get a lead?

203
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,416
Huh? Oh... no...
No, we weren't.

204
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,958
We're really sorry.

205
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,333
We searched everywhere
for that man. I swear!

206
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,833
All through the city!

207
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,166
But I'm afraid we didn't find
anything worth mentioning.

208
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,541
Never fear...!

209
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,750
Give us more time, and
I know we will find him...!

210
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,333
Anyhow... we're here
on other business today.

211
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,666
We came because we have
a little present for Febri.

212
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,625
A present for me?

213
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,208
[WANNAI] While we were
out scouring the city,

214
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,125
we found an adorable outfit.

215
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,333
[AWATSUKI] And we thought...

216
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,916
"Wow, that sure would
look cute on Febri!"

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,125
Yeah...? Isn't
that nice, Febri...?

218
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,375
A new outfit, just for you!

219
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,791
[SATEN] Okay, then...
why don't we open it?

220
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,041
[UIHARU] Wow!

221
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,083
That's really perfect!

222
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,416
[FEBRI] That...
that's for me?

223
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,875
[WANNAI] Yes.

224
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,083
Mitsuko, Wanna, Atsuki...
Thanks so much!

225
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,750
[KONGO] There's no
need to thank us...

226
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,125
Anyone else would
have done the same.

227
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,625
For Febri!

228
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,625
Yes! Very pretty!

229
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,625
[SATEN] Febri!

230
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,791
Your face is flushed...!

231
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,166
Do you feel like
you have a fever?

232
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,208
Don't know what
a fever's like...

233
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,166
My head just feels all foggy.

234
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,666
Um... A lollipop! Right...!

235
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,041
She's getting worse.
We have to hurry.

236
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,916
[typing]

237
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,375
Hey...

238
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,958
It's him! It's him! It's him!

239
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,333
That's the man we saw...

240
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,875
The one who was
talking on his phone

241
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,583
at the Reach Assembly Site.

242
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,833
Take a look, you two.
That is him isn't it?

243
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,208
[WANNAI]
Yes, definitely.

244
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,125
Oh, yeah.

245
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,416
I would recognize
him anywhere.

246
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,916
[MIKOTO] What's that photo from?

247
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,833
[UIHARU] The participant list
from last year's assembly.

248
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,958
Haruki Aritomi.

249
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,791
Oh! According to this he won
the Academic Reach Assembly's

250
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,708
first prize two years ago...

251
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,625
In fact, it seems he's a regular
participant and winner.

252
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,083
[WANNAI] Wow...!

253
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,916
If he consistently wins top
prizes at the assembly...

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,166
[AWATSUKI] ...it means
that he's one of the most

255
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,500
brilliant people
in all Academy City.

256
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,791
[KUROKO] This man?
Really? That's odd.

257
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,666
I've never even
heard of him before.

258
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,916
Of course not...

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,791
In a city that's full
of high-level espers,

260
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,625
an ordinary genius
doesn't really stand out.

261
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,625
[THERESTINA] Don't think for
a second that you understand

262
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,291
the true darkness
of those who lack

263
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,083
even your status in this city...

264
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,916
[UIHARU] Oh, hey...
Something else...

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,500
It doesn't look like he's
participating this year.

266
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,875
[KONORI] Hey, you know...

267
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,625
that reminds me of something
Captain Yomikawa said...

268
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,583
about how a lot of
regulars apparently

269
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,625
weren't showing up to
the assembly this year.

270
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,250
[UIHARU] Let me see...

271
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,875
Yeah... you're right, Konori...

272
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,000
It seems like a bunch of
the usual participants

273
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,041
aren't signed up.

274
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,375
[KUROKO] Let's take a good look.

275
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,708
Some of these people could
be his associates,right?

276
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,500
[typing]

277
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,791
[NUNOTABA] No relevant
data retrieved.

278
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,083
Okay, then...
That just leaves Lab One.

279
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,291
[SATEN] Gotcha!

280
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,125
Ahh! Hey!
I can't see!

281
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,541
[SATEN] So, little one...
Not still feverish...?

282
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,000
You really feel all right?

283
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:40,916
[FEBRI] Uh huh!

284
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,416
She had a good
appetite, too.

285
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,250
I think we can
rest easy for now.

286
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,208
[SATEN] Have you still been
searching this whole time?

287
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,333
Well, yeah...

288
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,333
I felt like I needed
to do something...

289
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,416
I'm checking out
this Aritomi guy...

290
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,666
Apparently he dropped out of
school just a little while ago.

291
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,458
Oh...

292
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,625
that's a shame, huh?

293
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,791
I mean, if he wins those prizes
every year, he must be smart...

294
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,166
wouldn't you agree...?

295
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,791
He could be doing something
that's more respectable.

296
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,500
Instead he works
for the underground

297
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,416
and tries to abduct
a little girl...

298
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,791
I just don't get it.

299
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,833
Yeah... why turn
to a life of crime?

300
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,000
Exactly...

301
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,875
I just learned about
the Reach Assembly.

302
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,375
But knowing there are non-espers
out there who are successful...

303
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,583
it really gives me hope.

304
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,458
Right, of course.

305
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,708
[KUROKO] Yes... If you
don't mind, Captain...

306
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,916
That would be great.

307
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,291
Okay.

308
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,208
She says there's not
enough evidence yet

309
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,208
to justify taking action...

310
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,250
Oh, well...

311
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,625
That's what we were expecting.

312
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,958
We knew they weren't
going to be much help...

313
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,291
not when you consider

314
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,708
how much pressure Antiskill's
under right now...

315
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,916
You're pretty quiet...

316
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,208
What's wrong?
Is something bothering you?

317
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,541
Yeah...

318
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,625
It was something that
she said to me earlier...

319
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,666
Therastina.

320
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,791
A lot of people in
Academy City have heard of

321
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,000
the Railgun of Tokiwadai
at some point, right?

322
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,666
I've met a bunch of people
because of that title...

323
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,916
It opens doors.

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,125
So, I was just wondering,
if I wasn't a Level 5...

325
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,333
if I wasn't, do you think...

326
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,875
Would it be the
same between us...?

327
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,625
I mean, you and
all the others...

328
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,125
would we still be good
friends like we are now?

329
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,166
Oh, don't be silly.

330
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,708
[KUROKO] The reason I'm so
attached to you is not because

331
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:27,541
you're the fabulously talented
Level 5 Railgun of Tokiwadai...

332
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,125
It's because you're
the reckless, stubborn,

333
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,333
and a little childish...

334
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,000
but still strong and
kind and thoughtful...

335
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,625
Big Sissy Mikoto Misaka.

336
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,041
That's good ...

337
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,708
Thanks, Kuroko...

338
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,500
However...

339
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,875
[KUROKO] Ahh!

340
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,833
[MIKOTO] Don't take advantage
of the situation...!

341
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,958
And don't call me
childish, either!

342
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,791
[KUROKO] Th-There's that, too...

343
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,958
I also love how
you show no mercy

344
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,666
when you decide that somebody...
deserves to be punished.

345
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,083
[MIKOTO] Heh.

346
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,208
[MIKOTO] STUDY Corporation?

347
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,166
[UIHARU] Yes...

348
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,958
Haruki Aritomi's name came up

349
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,458
as one of the company's
lead directors.

350
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,583
[KUROKO] Okay, so what
kind of company is it?

351
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,166
[UIHARU] They seem to
do a lot of things...

352
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,500
but mainly it's
pharmaceutical manufacturing

353
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,750
and chemical engineering.

354
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,833
[MIKOTO] So...

355
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,708
do they have any
suspicious facilities?

356
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,333
[UIHARU] According to
what I've found so far,

357
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,625
STUDY Corporation owns a
factory in School District 17.

358
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,875
It's an old factory and
nothing very special...

359
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,916
but the fact that they paid a
huge amount for it bothers me.

360
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,041
It's not much, but
it does seem fishy.

361
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,416
If it's a factory, do you
think it could be the place

362
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,958
where they created Febri?

363
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,875
[KUROKO] Maybe that's where
they made her candy...

364
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:39,125
If we could at least find out
what its components are, then...

365
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,416
I can think of one way
to find out for sure...

366
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,875
Go to the factory
and take a look.

367
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,333
We need to
move quickly.

368
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,666
[MIKOTO] The most important
thing for us to focus on now

369
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,625
is keeping Febri alive...

370
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,000
which means we either need
to get more of that candy

371
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,708
or figure out how
to manufacture it.

372
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,708
[MIKOTO] I have
to do this right.

373
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:10,166
Febri's life depends
on my success.

374
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,791
That bridge again...

375
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,000
[KAMIJO] I know you
have your own goals...

376
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,875
Mine is seeing everybody
get through this alive...

377
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,750
So... Let's work together...

378
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,541
Maybe we'll both win.

379
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,208
[MIKOTO] Thinking
back on it now...

380
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,458
It's such a naïve, and
unrealistic goal to have.

381
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,375
He can dream all he wants...

382
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,291
but is he prepared
for the consequences

383
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,083
if we should all lose?

384
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,333
[chuckles]

385
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,250
In the end, I guess...

386
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,958
You have to believe
in something.

387
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,375
[alarm sounds]

388
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,750
What is it?

389
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,375
[KOSAKO] There's an
intruder in Lab One.

390
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,750
That's unexpected...
Who could it be?

391
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,125
[KOSAKO] I don't know...

392
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,250
The security system just
went into Shift A alert.

393
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,958
The security at that laboratory
is intentionally low-priority.

394
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,125
After all, it is a decoy...

395
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,291
It's not surprising that
somebody is sniffing around.

396
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,333
It shouldn't interfere with our
plans at this point, should it?

397
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,208
Not if they're just
now finding Lab One.

398
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,208
There's nothing there that can
be used to hurt us, correct?

399
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,000
[MADARAME] All of Janie's
data has been relocated.

400
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,708
The info on the
neutralizing agent

401
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,916
is the only thing that's left.

402
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,791
[NUNOTABA] We should
make sure...

403
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,875
I'll go have a look around.

404
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,000
You're going
to Lab One?

405
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,333
Sounds like an
unnecessary risk to me.

406
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,625
I'm not going to do
anything heroic...

407
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,208
but we've come too far
with this to fail now...

408
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,375
I just want to make sure that
everything is still secure.

409
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,500
We don't want any surprises.

410
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,750
Very well. Go.

411
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,416
[gunfire]

412
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,000
[MUGINO] And once again,
there's nobody here.

413
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,416
What the hell?

414
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,000
Just like last time...
We were given ultra-bad intel.

415
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,125
We are still gonna get paid
for the job though, aren't we?

416
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,791
[MIKOTO] What...?
Those guys?

417
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,375
I didn't expect
to see them here!

418
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,458
Did they set up a trap because
they knew I was coming?

419
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,791
It doesn't look like
that's what they're doing...

420
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,583
Are they working against
STUDY Corporation?

421
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,625
Like some kind of
underground feud?

422
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,916
[FRENDA] Huh...?

423
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What's the matter Takitsubo?

424
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,541
Mugino!

425
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,583
[FRENDA] Ha...!
It's no use!

426
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,541
Takitsubo's badass AIM
Stalker lets her track

427
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,625
any ability she has
sensed before...!

428
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,791
All told...

429
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,208
that makes sneaking
up on us impossible!

430
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,750
[MIKOTO] An ability?

431
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,750
Does that mean that
someone is moving those

432
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,791
unmanned powered suits
using psychokinesis?

433
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,625
But there's no sign of
anybody around here...

434
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,375
Then, how are they doing it...

435
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,750
Maybe... some kind
of remote control?

436
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,000
[YOMIKAWA] It was lying
inside the powered suit...

437
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,625
It seems to be made of
the exact same components

438
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,875
as those that comprise
the girl Febri's body.

439
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,375
[MIKOTO]
It's theoretically possible

440
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,000
that the hair Antiskill found

441
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,000
acted as a sort of receiver
for some ability...

442
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,875
If that's the case...
and if one person alone

443
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,166
was moving that
many powered suits...

444
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,541
They must have
Level 5-grade power.

445
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,166
That severely limits who
the hair could belong to.

446
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,125
[FRENDA] Takitsubo!

447
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,250
Are you okay?

448
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,333
Yeah. I must be
tired from swimming.

449
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,583
Sure that's all?

450
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,333
Ugh... I'm sick of this...

451
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,208
Let's just go.

452
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,416
We'll be right
behind you.

453
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,666
Come on...
We're leaving.

454
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,208
[MIKOTO] Crap!

455
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,208
[FRENDA] What is it...?
Is something the matter?

456
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,916
No, nothing... It's okay...

457
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,958
My mind's just
playing tricks on me.

458
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,083
[FRENDA] Oh?
Ahh, I'm all sweaty...!

459
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,791
Let's hurry back to the pool.

460
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,208
That sounds good.

461
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,416
[KINUHATA] You probably
shouldn't swim anymore, though.

462
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
[MIKOTO sighs]

463
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,333
[MIKOTO] Man,
look at this place.

464
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,625
They really made a mess
of things in here...

465
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,708
I don't know...

466
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,125
I'll be lucky if I
can find anything.

467
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,791
Hold on...

468
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,166
Over that way...

469
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,416
An area with
functioning electricity.

470
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,583
[typing]

471
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,958
[MIKOTO] Stay where you are.

472
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,125
And don't even think
about trying anything.

473
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,208
It's you!

474
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:27,375
What're you...
doing here?

475
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,958
[MIKOTO] I was right, then.
You are involved with this.

476
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,458
What is going on...?

477
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,166
Are you in league
with these creeps?

478
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,916
[typing]

479
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,291
That's how Febri
knew my name!

480
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,833
You're the one who told
it to her, aren't you?

481
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,458
[computer beeps]

482
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,500
[MIKOTO] Hello!

483
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,166
Say something, would you?!

484
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,416
[NUNOTABA] Take that with you...

485
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,166
It's the neutralizing
agent data.

486
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,625
The what data?

487
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,666
[NUNOTABA] The formula
for the candy.

488
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,541
If you act now there
should still be enough time.

489
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,875
[MIKOTO] But why...

490
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,416
why are you giving this to me?

491
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,666
[NUNOTABA] Hmph. Sorry...

492
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,708
I guess you deserve
an explanation.

493
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,000
Yes... As you already suspected,

494
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,541
I'm the one who gave
Febri your name.

495
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,041
It's all I could think of...

496
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,416
I didn't know who
else to turn to.

497
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,333
This wasn't how I
originally planned it.

498
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,875
But today...

499
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,958
there was an unexpected
disturbance here in the lab...

500
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,375
Fortunately, I was able to get
away in time to meet you...

501
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,958
and now you'll be able
to keep Febri alive.

502
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,500
You can give her a future.

503
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,500
[ARITOMI] I'm afraid not.

504
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,291
What you have there
is just a dummy formula...

505
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,500
It won't do anything to help
with Febri's condition.

506
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:44,333
I knew it would be a good idea
to have some insurance.

507
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,833
So you were the one who
orchestrated Febri's escape.

508
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,625
For a traitor, you sure
keep interesting company...

509
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,583
Enlisting the help
of a celebrity.

510
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,625
Very resourceful...
I am quite impressed.

511
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,375
It's nice to finally have
the chance to meet you

512
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,041
in person, Railgun...

513
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,583
Put a face to the
data I've collected.

514
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,583
And very useful
data it has been.

515
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,666
So you're Haruki
Aritomi, huh?

516
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,208
Huh? This is surprising.

517
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,166
You seem to have gone to a
considerable amount of trouble.

518
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,833
And all just to
save Febri's life?

519
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,208
She is a fine product,
but even so...

520
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,000
"A fine product"...?!

521
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,458
Then it's true.
You're the one who created her!

522
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,750
[ARITOMI] Easy, now...

523
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,875
You shouldn't use electricity.

524
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:27,833
Unless you want to destroy
the real copy of the formula.

525
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,416
Nunotaba...

526
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,625
Inject that into
Railgun, here.

527
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,583
It will only incapacitate her...

528
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,083
She won't die.

529
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,458
And what's more...

530
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,833
if you follow my
instructions exactly...

531
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,083
I'm willing to hand
this over to you...

532
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:48,166
After all, we have no real
use for it at this point.

533
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,333
No, I can't do it.

534
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,333
Inject me.

535
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,291
This is to save Febri's life.

536
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,250
[ARITOMI chuckles]

537
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,208
[MIKOTO groans]

538
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,083
[ARITOMI] Ha...!

539
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,958
Strong enough to render
even a Level 5 powerless.

540
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,916
[NUNOTABA] All right.
I did what you asked.

541
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,416
Now give me the data.

542
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,125
Well... about our deal...

543
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,291
[gasps]

544
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,541
[ARITOMI] It's like I said...

545
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,666
We have no use for Febri...

546
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,416
She is just a spare.

547
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,041
She's a spare?

548
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,291
[ARITOMI] Yes.

549
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,833
For an invention that's
truly revolutionary.

550
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,666
We call it Janie.

551
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,916
[MIKOTO] I knew you were
involved in this...!

552
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,250
Care to explain yourself?

553
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,333
[NUNOTABA] To tell the truth...

554
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,583
It's a long,
complicated story...

555
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,750
See, once upon a time--

556
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,458
[MIKOTO] Come on!
This is no fairy tale!
