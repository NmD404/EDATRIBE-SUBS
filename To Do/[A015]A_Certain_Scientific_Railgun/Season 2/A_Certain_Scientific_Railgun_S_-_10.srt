1
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:34,166
[MIKOTO breathes heavily]

2
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,166
[MIKOTO] The attacks
have stopped...

3
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,166
Somehow I don't think that
means they're letting me go...

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,875
Are they just waiting
for my next move?

5
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:49,291
[MUGINO hums]

6
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,958
Heh...

7
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,250
[MIKOTO] They seem
to have an esper

8
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,208
who can pinpoint
someone's location...

9
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,125
which means trying to
hide isn't an option.

10
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,083
Unfortunately...

11
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,166
If I do run into them...

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,083
I don't have much of
a fight left in me.

13
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,166
[MIKOTO] I saw this tape before.

14
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,208
The blonde girl used it.

15
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,750
So... what?

16
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,750
Does she have this stuff laid
out all over the facility?

17
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,416
That's a problem.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,083
But maybe...

19
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,958
[MIKOTO] I can
make it her problem.

20
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,500
[MALE SUBORDINATE 10-A]
Good work in there.

21
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,458
We're meeting up
with Kinuhata...

22
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,500
at S Processor, okay?

23
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,625
The two of you wait here
until Mugino comes out.

24
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,291
[MALE SUBORDINATE 10-A]
Certainly.

25
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,916
[FRENDA] Phew!

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,833
I'm wiped out!

27
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:40,875
[TAKITSUBO] Frenda...

28
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,125
Huh?

29
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,750
We're leaving
because of me...

30
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,291
If it was just you,
you could've stayed.

31
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,875
Don't worry
about it, okay?

32
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,041
Mugino's fine handling
it on her own from here.

33
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,416
[FRENDA] And besides...

34
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,333
you were the one who was
really helping her, not me.

35
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,916
Speaking of which...

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,541
shouldn't you have reined your
power in a little bit sooner?

37
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:03,708
I was kind of starting
to get scared for you.

38
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,416
I'm okay.

39
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,125
As long as I'm here...

40
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,916
where I belong.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,916
[FRENDA] Hm. Yeah, sure.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,208
Sometimes it's good to
have more than one place

43
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,500
where you belong,
though, y'know?

44
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,041
--So then...
--Ah!

45
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:25,458
Ahhhh!

46
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,125
What's wrong?

47
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,500
My bombs...

48
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,000
I forgot to retrieve
them all when we left.

49
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:37,458
[footsteps]

50
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,208
Ah... you're finally here...

51
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,375
So you like being
fashionably late, huh?

52
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,458
[MUGINO] Frenda!

53
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,166
You took off without
cleaning up after yourself?

54
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,583
[MIKOTO] Where are
your little buddies?

55
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,083
[MUGINO] I sent them away.

56
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,083
Because I wanted to take
you on personally...

57
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,000
Railgun.

58
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,333
[MIKOTO] She figured it out...

59
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,625
Well, that's okay...

60
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,375
She wants to do this one-on-one?

61
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,625
That's fine by me.

62
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,416
Let's play, then!

63
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,083
[MUGINO] Ah...
Is that the plan?

64
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,416
You're using Frenda's bombs
to make up for the fact

65
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,375
that your power has
been diminished?

66
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,208
Of course, by doing so...

67
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,958
You're admitting you're too
weak to defeat me on your own.

68
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,625
You realize that, don't you?

69
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,708
[MIKOTO] Impressive.

70
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,458
She can deflect blast waves...

71
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,083
Which means...

72
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,416
[MUGINO] Heh.
Doing this again?

73
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,375
Wait--She could use the blast as
a diversion to get behind me...

74
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,708
Or maybe...

75
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,041
she'll ignore me entirely
and just charge inside.

76
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:49,958
However...

77
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,166
If I can shoot it down first...

78
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,541
[MUGINO] Hold on!

79
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,041
Did you rig the doll somehow?

80
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,750
With some metal inside, I can
control them magnetically.

81
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,750
Tch... You keep
getting more annoying.

82
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,708
[MIKOTO] If there's
just one of them,

83
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,666
I'm sure you have no
problem shooting it down.

84
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,000
Huh?

85
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,458
[MIKOTO] Heh.

86
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,583
But if this many dollies
come out to play?

87
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,750
[gasps]

88
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,833
[MIKOTO] As far as I can tell,

89
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,750
she can't lay down a curtain
of fire with her power.

90
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,916
That means there's
one thing to do...

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,125
[MUGINO] So this is how you
plan to incapacitate me?

92
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,416
"Silicon Burn."

93
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm not afraid to shore up
my weaknesses with props

94
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,416
if it's necessary.

95
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,583
You would do well to respect
ITEM, you little brat!

96
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,125
[MUGINO] That imbecile Frenda

97
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,666
has made my job
more complicated.

98
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,583
But I think I can still handle
a middle schooler, thank you...

99
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,000
Honestly...

100
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,958
Third-ranked, my ass.

101
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,916
Why did you earn that title?

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,208
Because the research
applications of your ability

103
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,333
were so profitable?

104
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,291
And here I am,
ranked fourth.

105
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,708
All I have to do is
slaughter you right here.

106
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,250
That ought to prove
that you don't deserve

107
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,875
the rank you've been given.

108
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,083
[MIKOTO] The fourth-ranked
Level 5?

109
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,416
That makes her...

110
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,666
the esper known as Meltdowner.

111
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,583
All right, then.

112
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,333
Aw, look at that.

113
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,083
Only three left.

114
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:47,833
[MUGINO] Huh?

115
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,125
Hey, what's wrong?

116
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,250
Don't tell me you've run
out of moves already...

117
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,625
That would be so disappointing.

118
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,041
How pathetic.

119
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,791
You've been reduced
to a suicide attack?

120
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,083
Please.

121
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,833
Don't tell me you couldn't
even get the timing right?

122
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,958
What? Another?

123
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,875
She had one in reserve!

124
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,875
A shield! No...

125
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,666
At this range, there's
not enough time...

126
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,041
Damn you!

127
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,916
Yeah... Nice try!

128
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,375
Did you forget that quickly?

129
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,125
I can deflect those
electric shocks

130
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,125
that you rely so heavily upon.

131
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,416
You didn't actually think you
had won just now, did you?

132
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,750
This fight was over almost
as soon as it began...

133
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,250
Railgu--

134
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,666
Did you forget
that quickly?

135
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,333
I told you, I rigged
these things with metal.

136
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,333
They're lethal enough,
even without exploding.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,875
[MIKOTO] Is this it?

138
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,791
Surely that'll be enough
to wipe it all out.

139
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,458
I would have
liked to have seen

140
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,166
every last inch of this
place burned to ashes...

141
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,500
but with the shape I'm in,

142
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,166
I would've gotten caught
in the blaze, too.

143
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,458
The problem now is
that other facility...

144
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,250
If there are espers
as strong as the ones

145
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,916
I was up against here...

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I couldn't...

147
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:55,916
[MIKOTO gasps]

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,250
What the--?

149
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,875
How can she be gone?

150
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,750
She should still be knocked
senseless at this point!

151
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,708
[gasps]

152
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,291
[MUGINO] Hey, now...
this is no time to lie down.

153
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,916
We've still got some
unfinished business.

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,666
I'm gonna pay you back for this.

155
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,291
A trillion times over!

156
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,541
[MIKOTO groans]

157
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,125
[MUGINO] Aw, what's the matter?

158
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,416
Your tummy hurt?

159
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,125
Just get up already.

160
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,250
Unless you want to be turned
to charcoal where you lie.

161
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,208
[MUGINO] Well, well...

162
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,083
aren't we a spry little thing?

163
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,500
[MIKOTO] Lucky for me,

164
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,250
I haven't had anything to
eat in the last few days.

165
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,916
[MUGINO yells]

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,083
[MUGINO] Stop running away!

167
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,333
You're not so brave now that
you've run out of bombs,

168
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,541
are you?

169
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,291
You are a disgrace to your rank!

170
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,833
[MIKOTO] You know, I really
think I can live with that.

171
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,541
I've done what I
came here for...

172
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,500
Now I just need to get out.

173
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,125
With the electrical
systems shot...

174
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,166
I've got three escape routes.

175
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,583
There are the
emergency stairs...

176
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,875
No... not with her ability...

177
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,041
She could punch
through the staircase...

178
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,666
There isn't much room
to dodge her, either.

179
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,958
There's also the route
to the freight entrance...

180
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,125
Except... There's only
one way through...

181
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,208
If it's blocked in even
one place, I'll be trapped.

182
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,833
Which leaves...

183
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:24,291
[MUGINO laughs]

184
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,708
[MUGINO] Oh-h, you really
want this to end in a draw?

185
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,791
Just look at you
scuttling away...

186
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,416
Watching you flee like that,

187
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,541
you look more like a
cockroach than a spider.

188
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,375
In which case, I'll
squash you underfoot,

189
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,708
like the vermin you are.

190
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,541
[phone rings]

191
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,708
Yeah?

192
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,250
[KINUHATA] It's Kinuhata.

193
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,625
[MUGINO] What's up?

194
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,333
I'm at the best part of
the fight, so keep it short.

195
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,416
[KINUHATA] They've finished all
the preparations for relocation.

196
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,375
Takitsubo and Frenda have
just gotten here, too.

197
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,958
[MUGINO] Huh?

198
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,333
So knocking the ground out from
underneath her doesn't work...

199
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,166
I'll have to take a
more direct approach.

200
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,500
[KINUHATA] Mugino?

201
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes... Yes...
I understand.

202
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:11,208
Huh? You want me to
tell her word-for-word?

203
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,125
Right,
got it... Bye.

204
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,500
She's given us
the all-clear.

205
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,125
We can go
ahead as planned.

206
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,875
Uh...
just wondering...

207
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,833
Yes?

208
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,541
[FRENDA] Did Mugino...
you know...

209
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,291
sound like she was
mad or anything?

210
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,791
What with... the
bomb stuff... and all?

211
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,083
Not really...

212
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,833
I'd say she sounded
more wound-up than mad.

213
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,458
Okay. Whew!

214
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,750
Although, there was a message
she wanted me to give you.

215
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,500
Hm?
What message?

216
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,041
"You may expect your punishment
to be both long and painful."

217
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,000
That's it.

218
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,166
[MIKOTO] Can I make
it out this way?

219
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,291
[MUGINO] Heh.

220
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,416
[MIKOTO grunts]

221
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,000
You just block, and
block, and block... Huh?

222
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,625
You're never going to beat
me by playing defense!

223
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,000
Do you think this kind
of child's play will get you

224
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,041
anywhere against the
underworld of Academy City?

225
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,000
Come on... at least make
this entertaining for me.

226
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,958
You're going to die,
no doubt about it.

227
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,458
But wouldn't you rather
go out with a bang?

228
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,041
[MIKOTO groans]

229
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,208
[MUGINO sighs]

230
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,500
[MUGINO] I get that
you're desperate...

231
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,000
but still, choosing
this place to run to,

232
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,458
you're practically begging
to be slaughtered.

233
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,333
The third-ranked Level 5?

234
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,791
More like a wet behind
the ears little girl!

235
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,708
Come on now, I'm giving you
one last chance to fight back;

236
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,583
Why not try out that little
Railgun you're so famous for?

237
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:09,291
This is the perfect opportunity.

238
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,416
[MIKOTO laughs]

239
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,666
[MUGINO] Huh? Hey, now...

240
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,166
It's no fun if you go crazy

241
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,666
before I get the chance
to torture you.

242
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,583
My Railgun?

243
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,333
After all of this...

244
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,166
I don't have enough power
to avoid one of your blasts,

245
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,333
much less use my Railgun.

246
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,666
You see...

247
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,833
that's why I gambled
and came this way.

248
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,041
Huh?

249
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,750
[MIKOTO] You know that
blond pal of yours?

250
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,916
She really gave me a hard time.

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,916
Blowing me away with her bombs.

252
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,958
Duping me. Kicking me...
And, of course...

253
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,791
Nearly plunging me to my death
by knocking out the floor.

254
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,500
See?

255
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,083
That got me thinking...

256
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,291
She was very thorough, setting
up traps all over this place...

257
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,208
So, I figured, the
chances were pretty good

258
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,875
that she rigged up some
explosives in this area.

259
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,291
Even as weak as I am...

260
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,291
I can make enough of
a spark to set this off.

261
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,541
Not too shabby for a wet
behind the ears little girl...

262
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,833
Don't you think?

263
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,666
[MUGINO gasps]

264
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,166
[MUGINO] Frenda!

265
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,083
Here... Grab on!

266
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,791
No way...

267
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,833
Did she just...?

268
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,791
[MUGINO] Hey, get down here!

269
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,125
[MIKOTO] That didn't kill her?

270
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,125
Man, she's a tough one!

271
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,708
She scampered away, huh?

272
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,333
My Meltdowner rays may
have slowed me up enough

273
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,791
to keep me alive...

274
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,791
but that landing still
leaves a lot to be desired.

275
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,875
Guess I'll need to
fine tune that a bit.

276
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,333
I'll get Takitsubo to track her
down again, and this time...

277
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,875
No, think...

278
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,791
She's a student at Tokiwadai
Middle School, isn't she? Yes...

279
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,958
So what could she have
been after here, then?

280
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,916
[MIKOTO] I accomplished
what I came here to do...

281
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,875
One more down... but
there's that last facility.

282
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,208
And my power is drained.

283
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,916
Damn...

284
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,250
[MALE RESEARCHER 10-A]
Come on, hurry !

285
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,750
Almost the entire
upstairs is in flames!

286
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:29,875
[MALE RESEARCHER 10-B] Huh?

287
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,250
But there's still
more stuff to move!

288
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,958
[MALE RESEARCHER 10-A]
Just forget about that junk!

289
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,666
Damn! I thought they
hired protection!

290
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,083
We were supposed to be
safe from these attacks!

291
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,583
Those underworld scum! Usele--

292
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,500
Hey... what the hell...?

293
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,666
[MALE RESEARCHER 10-C screams]

294
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,208
I've developed an
interest in the project

295
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,166
that Railgun came to this
facility to put a stop to.

296
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,166
Show me.

297
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,375
Uh... There's no
way I can do that!

298
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,375
I can't leak that
kind of information!

299
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,916
They'd have me elimina--

300
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,833
I can turn you into a bloody
pile of dismembered flesh

301
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,500
right here and now.

302
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,833
Or you can take your chances
living life on the run

303
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,916
from your former employers.

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,666
Which do you prefer?

305
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,958
[MUGINO laughs]

306
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,041
You can't be serious!

307
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,583
This is what they've got the
first-ranked Level 5 doing?

308
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,500
Trying to level up
by exterminating

309
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,916
twenty thousand cockroaches?

310
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What can the Academy City
governors' board

311
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,833
possibly be thinking...?

312
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,958
Huh?

313
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,875
Oh... so that's it, huh?

314
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:36,125
And then, as for
those of us in ITEM...

315
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,375
This should be
very interesting...

316
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,833
I think I'd like to wait and
see how this drama plays out.

317
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,708
Why kill someone when
you can watch them suffer?

318
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,333
Right?

319
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,500
[MIKOTO] It's morning already?

320
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,833
[MIKOTO sighs]

321
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,750
Aww.

322
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,083
I must look like a mess.

323
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,791
[horns honk]

324
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,875
[MIKOTO] S Processor...

325
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,750
the institute for
neuroscience analysis.

326
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,916
The last facility associated
with the experiment.

327
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,791
Or, at least,
I think it is.

328
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,500
[MIKOTO] This is weird...

329
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,208
There's no traffic
going in or out.

330
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,583
Never mind security,

331
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,750
there isn't a single electrical
device at work here.

332
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,375
A trap?

333
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,916
[MIKOTO] It's totally
deserted, all right...

334
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,791
And it's not only that...

335
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,250
all of the data has been erased.

336
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,833
[MIKOTO] Have they given up?

337
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,208
Could yesterday's battle have
been enough to dissuade them?

338
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,416
I don't know.

339
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,083
Maybe they can't
sustain the project

340
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,750
with just one location...

341
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,125
That could be it.

342
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,916
I fought them...

343
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,625
and eventually,
they backed down.

344
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,750
Does that mean...

345
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,333
It's over?

346
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,666
Can it be?

347
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,416
That seems too good
to be true, somehow...

348
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,333
I guess that's not surprising,

349
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,583
given all the crazy things
that have been happening.

350
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,666
[cat meows]

351
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,708
That's all there is...

352
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,750
Farewell, Big Sister.

353
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:12,666
[MIKOTO yells]

354
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,041
[ACCELERATOR] Ah,
I understand now!

355
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,458
I was wondering what this was
since it wasn't on the schedule.

356
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,875
You...

357
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,458
You're the Original.

358
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,250
Hello there,
I'm Accelerator.

359
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,750
It's a pleasure.

360
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,250
[MIKOTO] Why?

361
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,375
You're breathing, aren't you?
You have life, don't you?

362
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,166
Isn't that enough?

363
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,208
What, not who...

364
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,041
Misaka is a product created
for this project...

365
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,583
Artificial bodies...
with artificial minds...

366
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,750
Laboratory animals,
with a unit price

367
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,750
of one hundred and
eighty thousand.

368
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,083
[MIKOTO] It's not like
I'll be able to pretend

369
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,458
that none of this
ever happened...

370
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,750
There's still
a lot for me to do.

371
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,333
A lot of things to
set straight... but...

372
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,166
The experiments...
are over.

373
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,500
And as for them...

374
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,000
[MIKOTO] The sisters...

375
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,916
they... they can finally live.

376
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,250
[SATEN] No matter what,
we're all here for you...

377
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,875
If your burden is ever too
heavy, just say the word, okay?

378
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,458
[MIKOTO] Well, guys...

379
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,125
I'm coming home now.

380
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,708
[KAMIJO] Come on!

381
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,375
[KAMIJO] What is
with this thing?

382
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,791
I gave it plenty of money.

383
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,583
I don't understand!

384
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,416
Is it out of order?

385
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
[MIKOTO] Heh.

386
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,375
[KAMIJO] Seriously?

387
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,333
[KAMIJO] Oh, you again, Zapper?

388
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,291
Wait a minute; there are two
of you. Is that your sister?

389
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,000
Ah, well, together we shall
embark upon a grand adventure--

390
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,291
[MIKOTO] No, we won't!

391
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,416
And why are you even
doing the preview, anyway?
