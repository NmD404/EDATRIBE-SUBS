1
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,000
[YOMIKAWA] I've gotta say...

2
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,208
security robots
malfunctioning like this

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,958
is a real black eye
for Antiskill.

4
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,625
Luckily for us all,
it didn't get too serious.

5
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,875
Whoa... that's
definitely strange.

6
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,916
Have you found the
source of the problem?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,250
It's kinda
hard to tell.

8
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,416
These robots were just
brought to the site

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,500
and their main batteries
haven't been installed yet.

10
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,750
That doesn't make any
sense. Are you sure?

11
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,375
Yeah... Forget malfunctioning,

12
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,875
these things shouldn't
be functioning at all...

13
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:54,125
Maybe there was power left
in the auxiliary batteries?

14
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,708
[SATEN] Okay...
I guess that's that...

15
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,166
Yeah, don't worry.

16
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,833
Bye for now...

17
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,708
Uiharu and Shirai still have
to investigate the site,

18
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,833
so they'll be awhile.

19
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,458
She said to go
ahead without them.

20
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,041
Okay, Febri. What do you think?

21
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,208
How about I give you
this red Gekota,

22
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,875
and you give me
back the pink one?

23
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,333
This one's cute, too, right?

24
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,375
Look, look!

25
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,375
[FEBRI] No.

26
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,625
[MIKOTO] Ugghh...

27
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, how about together
with this blue Gekota?

28
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,083
And, hey, I'll even
throw in the yellow one.

29
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:53,875
Do we have a deal?

30
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,875
[FEBRI] This is my Gekota!

31
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,041
[FEBRI giggles]

32
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,875
[MIKOTO] If I don't find
a way to get it back soon,

33
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,583
it really will be
hers forever...!

34
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,916
Out of all of them...

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,875
Why did she have to
fixate on the pink--

36
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,916
the color I only have one of?

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
So, it has come to this.

38
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,041
You've been at
that awhile...

39
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,791
You sure do like finger puppets.

40
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,791
[KONGO] Misaka, Saten!

41
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,125
Hello once again.

42
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,625
Yes, hello!

43
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,166
Hi, Kongo!

44
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,291
[FEBRI] Mitsuko!

45
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,375
Oh, my, you're in good spirits,
aren't you, sweetie?

46
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,166
You really came
through before...

47
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,500
I mean it, if you
hadn't spotted Febri,

48
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,375
who knows what might
have happened to her?

49
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,583
Yeah, thank you so
much for your help...

50
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,750
Febri, do you want to
tell Mitsuko something?

51
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,166
Thank you, Mitsuko!

52
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,208
[gasps]

53
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,833
N-No thanks necessary,
I'm sure...

54
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,125
I only did what anyone would
have in the same position.

55
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,541
[KONGO laughs]

56
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,541
Well... we were all just
about to go out for some tea.

57
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,458
It should be fun.
Would you like to come along?

58
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,916
Wow...! A tea party...!

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,916
Oh... While I appreciate
the kind invitation,

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,291
there are still duties here
to which I must attend.

61
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,541
No worries... You go on
and have fun, Kongo.

62
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,791
Yeah...

63
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,500
We can manage the rest
on our own, I'm sure.

64
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,916
[KONGO] How can you
say such a thing...?

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,708
I offered to help, and
that's what I intend to do!

66
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:14,333
Mitsuko Kongo is not someone
who abandons her friends!

67
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,166
Okay! Mitsuko!
Wanna! Atsuki!

68
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,750
Thank you, bye-bye!

69
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,458
Have a nice day!

70
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,208
And be careful!

71
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,541
All right, then...

72
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,125
Shall we continue on with
our business, ladies...?

73
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,458
Wait...

74
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,625
Heh...

75
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,083
That man again...

76
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,666
[typing]

77
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,291
[SEIKIMURA] How lucky that we
already have a chance to test

78
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,416
the data we acquired on the
fourth-ranked the other day.

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
[SAKURAI] I would have liked to
have had more time to prepare...

80
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,625
but I suppose I
shouldn't complain.

81
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,083
[MADARAME] This should
be interesting...

82
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,750
I wonder what kind of data
we'll get this time around.

83
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,333
Well, I think it will be
at least mildly entertaining.

84
00:04:56,416 --> 00:05:00,041
Let's see what you
can do... Railgun.

85
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,875
[SATEN] They've got posters
for the Reach Assembly

86
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,166
put up all over the place, huh?

87
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,833
[MIKOTO] So, what
do you think...

88
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,708
I mean, now that
we've seen some of it ?

89
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,416
I'm not sure what I expected.

90
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,208
I've never actually been to one
of these assemblies, either.

91
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,458
Well... I imagine
it would be nice,

92
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,458
having a field of study that
you were passionate about...

93
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,583
Maybe I should try to find
something to research...

94
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,166
Urban legends, maybe!

95
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,583
I don't know
about that...

96
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,083
Oh... No?

97
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,541
[WAITRESS 20-A]
Thank you for waiting.

98
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,708
Ooh, here it
comes, Febri!

99
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,166
[WAITRESS 20-A] Your very
special ice cream.

100
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,333
Well, shucks, you can't eat
with your hands full, can you?

101
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,125
I guess I have no choice but
to hold the pink Gekota for you

102
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,041
while you have your
ice cream... Here.

103
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,208
Aaahhh...

104
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,250
Aw... Such a spoiled
little girl.

105
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,125
There ya go.

106
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,791
Yum!

107
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,708
Aaahhh...

108
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,375
Okay!

109
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,000
[KONORI] Whew...!

110
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,041
I thought we would
never be finished!

111
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,458
We still haven't found the cause
of the security robot incident.

112
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,708
Come to think of it, we
don't know what was behind

113
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,750
the traffic light outage
yesterday, either.

114
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,541
A rash of mysterious
mechanical trouble.

115
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,083
[KUROKO] Hmm?

116
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,166
That sounds like the kind of
story Saten would like to hear.

117
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,333
[KUROKO] Yeah.

118
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,625
[KONORI] Hey...
do you two have some time?

119
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,875
[SATEN] Is it good?

120
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,708
[FEBRI] Yeah! Yeah...!
I want more, more, more!

121
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,166
All right, all right.

122
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,333
[MIKOTO] Yes, hello...?
Oh, Kuroko...

123
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,916
What...? Hold on,
where are you?

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,833
[MIKOTO] So... this is what
you do in your free time?

125
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:37,958
[KONORI] Just you wait...

126
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,916
Nothing beats this
when you're tired...

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What do you say, Febri?

128
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,500
Have you ever been to
one of these before...?

129
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,958
Inside they've got the
biggest bathtub ever!

130
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,541
[UIHARU] It's so big we
can all go in together!

131
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,125
[KUROKO] Oh, yes...
sharing a bath with Sissy

132
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,833
is something I've
always dreamed about!

133
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,208
Leave it to me, Sissy...!

134
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,333
I'll be the best bath
attendant you have ever had.

When I'm done with you,
every last inch of your body

They're adorable!

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,875
Tell you what, then.
You can keep it.

177
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,083
Take good care
of it, though.

178
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,333
You promise?

179
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,083
Uh-huh!
Thanks alot, Mikoto!

180
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,666
That's really nice, but
Gekota was already my Gekota.

181
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,875
[MIKOTO] Eh?!

182
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,958
[SATEN] Hey, Misaka,
if Febri's all clean,

183
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,541
come over here and
I'll get your back!

184
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,500
[UIHARU] Ooh, Saten, when you're
done, will you get my back, too?

185
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,750
[SATEN] Sure.

186
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,958
[KONORI] See, I told
you it would be fun!

187
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,916
[MIKOTO]
You're getting water everywhere!

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,125
[KUROKO] Sissy...

189
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,250
Paradise awaits just
beyond those doors...!

190
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,166
A sweet, blissful haven that
I alone can truly appreciate!

191
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,083
[HEAD RESIDENT]
Did I say you could stop?

192
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,791
Come on. Can't you rub
any harder than that?

193
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,333
Yeah...

194
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,875
[KONORI] Well, I'm
headed this way, so...

195
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,166
...guess I'll see you tomorrow.

196
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,791
Sounds good. See you later!

197
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,625
Have a good
night! See ya'!

198
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,875
Okay, Kuroko,
let's get going.

199
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,250
[KUROKO] A bath with Sissy...

200
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,791
A once in a lifetime
opportunity!

201
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,041
It should have been me
in there with her...!

202
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,125
Oh, cruel, cruel world!

203
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,625
[MIKOTO] Geez, Kuroko...
What's with you?

204
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,166
[KUROKO sobs]

205
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,583
[FEBRI] Ruiko...

206
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,041
Okay.

207
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,833
I guess it's been a pretty big
day for such a little girl.

208
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,291
[MIKOTO] Your back has become
reserved seating, huh?

209
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,708
Non-stop piggy back rides.

210
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,125
Yeah... I don't mind.

211
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,583
I only get to carry her
around for five more days.

212
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,208
I'm really gonna miss
her when she's gone.

213
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,416
[UIHARU] Yeah...

214
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,125
but it's not like we'll
never see her again.

215
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,500
[SATEN chuckles]

216
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,708
[KUROKO] You try to remember
that, too, Sissy...

217
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,708
Don't get all sad.

218
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,916
I... wasn't planning on it.

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,625
[FEBRI] Gekota...

220
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,375
Well... maybe just a little.

221
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,791
[UIHARU] Once she gets all
settled at Asunaro Park,

222
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,250
we can go and
visit her together.

223
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,708
Of course!

224
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,375
Uh, but... this time
I think I'll make sure

225
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,083
to leave all of
my Gekotas at home.

226
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,250
[SATEN] Oh, come on now, Misaka!

227
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,625
[KUROKO] I don't know
what the big deal is.

228
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,125
You have so many of them.

229
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,916
[MIKOTO] Yeah, well, they're
not exactly easy to come by!

230
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,666
[SATEN] Huh?

231
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,958
Sidewalk closed?

232
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,666
[UIHARU] It shouldn't
be a big problem...

233
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,208
Let's just go up one
street and cross there.

234
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,041
[MIKOTO] Uh?

235
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,750
[KUROKO] It's closed here, too?

236
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,750
[UIHARU] It's a pretty
long way around,

237
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,583
but if there's construction,
I guess we don't have a choice.

238
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,291
[SATEN] This is annoying, huh?

239
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,541
[UIHARU] Um...

240
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,666
A dead end. We can't
get through here.

241
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,250
[SATEN] We followed the
detour map exactly, right?

242
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,833
[MIKOTO] I thought
we did, but...

243
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,958
Hold on, I can look
it up on my GPS...

244
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,041
That's strange...

245
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,166
I've got several
missed calls from Kongo.

246
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,750
What does Her
Highness want?

247
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,625
Oh... so do I.

248
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,208
Wow... that many?

249
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,208
[UIHARU] She must have called
while we were in the bathhouse,

250
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,375
and we didn't notice.

251
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,250
I wonder if it was
something important.

252
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,875
[loud clang]

253
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,500
[SATEN] What's that?

254
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,083
[KOSAKO chuckles]

255
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,875
Now... let the experiment begin.

256
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,958
Get back!

257
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,041
Be careful!

258
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,000
[MIKOTO] You know,
I'm not sure...

259
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,291
who you are exactly...

260
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,833
but come on...

261
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:04,166
did you actually think this
was going to work against me?!

262
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,333
[MIKOTO yells]

263
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,041
Are you okay?

264
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,125
[MIKOTO] Kuroko!

265
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,875
Keep out of this!

266
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,333
Are you sure?

267
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,791
[MIKOTO] I can't control it?

268
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,666
It's not using shields...

269
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,458
In fact, it's got no
electrical systems at all.

270
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,583
Just like the
simulations predicted...

271
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,250
Well then, next up...

272
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,875
[MIKOTO] How is it moving?

273
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,833
[MIKOTO] I'm not sure
what's going on,

274
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,208
but it looks like the type of
thing that has someone inside.

275
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,375
[grunts] Come on...!

276
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,208
I've got better
things to do today!

277
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,250
Oh, no! Look out!

278
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,083
You're okay!

279
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,625
Get your phone...!
Contact Antiskill!

280
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,208
I'll get
right on it!

281
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:05,625
Uh... no good.

282
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,041
What's wrong... hurry!

283
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,041
[UIHARU] I'm not
getting a cell signal!

284
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,583
No signal? That's kinda' weird--

285
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,875
[MIKOTO] Febri!

286
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,125
This isn't a
good place to be!

287
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,250
What are you doing...?
Get away from here!

288
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,875
[alarm sounds]

289
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,458
[typing]

290
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,500
[KOSAKO] What's the matter?!

291
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,125
It's over...?

292
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,166
[KONGO yells]

293
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,291
Uhh...

294
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,583
[KONGO laughs]

295
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:51,125
That stupid machine should find
a different dance partner!

296
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,208
It's Kongo!

297
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,166
Geez! What the heck
are you doing here?

298
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,916
[KONGO] Wherever Kongo's
friends are, there she will be.

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,041
Huh?

300
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,666
[KONGO] So, tell me,
what is going on here?

301
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,916
Not sure...

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,166
I don't know who would
do something like this.

303
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,250
[gasps]

304
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,541
Hey, wait... that's...

305
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,958
It's empty?

306
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,833
This makes no sense.

307
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,500
[SATEN] Febri!

308
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,833
What's the matter...?
C'mon wake up!

309
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,666
Oh, no!

310
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,750
We did predict that
this might happen...

311
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,416
It's always nice when your
calculations are proved correct,

312
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,833
isn't it?

313
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:28,666
[MIKOTO] Febri...!

314
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,333
Are you all right...? Febri!

315
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,666
Does she have an injury?

316
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,875
[UIHARU] I'll call an ambulance!

317
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,166
But our phones
aren't working--

318
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,541
The signal's getting
through now.

319
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,666
Okay, then call
someone, already!

320
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,750
[KUROKO] R-Right, I'm on it.

321
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,291
[YOMIKAWA] Really?
You guys again?

322
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,333
I wish you had been
there to see it!

323
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,125
I was simply amazing...!

324
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,958
The horrible robot
was closing in,

325
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,166
but I plucked it up
and tossed it aside...

326
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,375
[YOMIKAWA] No pilot, no battery,
and no idea what's going on.

327
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,375
That sounds an awful lot like
the security robots, doesn't it?

328
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,833
We're telling you
the truth...!

329
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,125
Please, just take a look
at the surveillance cameras,

330
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,583
and you'll see!

331
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,208
Calm down. It's not that I
doubt what you're saying...

332
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,083
but I've already received the
reports from the cameras...

333
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,958
and they haven't seen
anything out of the ordinary.

334
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,125
Could they be wrong?

335
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,583
Let me think, here...

336
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,291
Could it be connected to our
phones not working, maybe?

337
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,666
Just leave this up to
Antiskill for now.

338
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,125
Yeah, but...

339
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,833
Your young friend was taken
to the hospital, right...?

340
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,083
See how she's doing.

341
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,291
I guess we should...

342
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,208
Let's go.

343
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,583
Uh... right.

344
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,541
[KUROKO] Thank you.

345
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,916
Yeah.

346
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,333
[sighs] Just great...
Could my job get any weirder?

347
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,791
Hmm...
What's this?

348
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,708
[MIKOTO] Right.

349
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,333
Yes, okay... bye.

350
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,916
Kuroko says they'll
be here soon.

351
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,833
It didn't look like she
was injured or anything...

352
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,958
She'll be okay... won't she?

353
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,791
[MIKOTO] It's the waiting...
that's the worst, isn't it?

354
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,791
[SATEN] Hm?

355
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,291
She'll wake up
and it'll be fine.

356
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,250
[MIKOTO chuckles]

357
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,708
[door opens]

358
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,291
Febri!

359
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,625
Doctor, please...

360
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,041
[MALE DOCTOR 20-A]
Her fever hasn't gone down...

361
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,083
and she hasn't
regained consciousness.

362
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,583
I don't know why her
condition is worsening...

363
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,333
I'm stumped.

364
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,500
There is nothing more
we can do for her here.

365
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,166
We're moving her to
another hospital right now.

366
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,708
O-kay...

367
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,083
This is yours now...

368
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,291
Keep it close to you.

369
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,083
[KOSAKO] Excellent!

370
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,000
We now know that our work
can hold its own nicely

371
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,791
against Railgun
and her ability...

372
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,208
Though it would have been
preferable if our machine

373
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,541
made it through the
experiment in better shape.

374
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,750
Well, we all take risks in
the name of greater knowledge.

375
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,291
[SAKURAI]
Today's data has ensured

376
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,041
that the program will
be even more accurate.

377
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:15,958
[SEIKIMURA]
It's actually a good thing

378
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,041
the third-ranked interfered.

379
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,041
Today's experiment has
demonstrated something vital...

380
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,125
The fact that even those espers
who possess greatest abilities

381
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,000
are vulnerable to attack...

382
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,083
Academy city's inconsistency
will be exposed.

383
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,708
And now, my friends,
it's time to call a vote.

384
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,500
Concerning Febri's...
disposition?

385
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,375
[SATEN] It's taking
awhile, isn't it?

386
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,333
So, uh...

387
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,583
what was that thing we saw...?

388
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,708
If it had never shown up...

389
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,666
maybe she would be okay.

390
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,000
[MIKOTO] I don't know
who these people are.

391
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,375
But that thing...

392
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,500
it came after me.

393
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:04,333
It's my fault. I did it.

394
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,166
She's in pain because of me.

395
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,833
[KUROKO] Sissy...!

396
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,166
Oh, hey...
I'm glad you're here.

397
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,958
[UIHARU]
So, how is Febri doing?

398
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,875
Sorry, we...
don't know.

399
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,000
[UIHARU] Oh, okay.

400
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,541
Any news?

401
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:24,083
Well... Antiskill has taken over
the investigation for now...

402
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,875
and, unfortunately, we haven't
gotten any leads so far.

403
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,250
I'd like to know...

404
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,666
What are you doing here,
Your High-and-Mightyness?!

405
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,416
You have to ask?
Like all of you,

406
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,958
I came because I'm concerned
about Febri, of course.

407
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,000
I guess that I should
thank you again...

408
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,750
I do appreciate it...

409
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,250
Oh, yeah, and I saw that
you called us earlier?

410
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,791
[KONGO] Yes... yes, I did!

411
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,625
There is something I felt
that you needed to know...

412
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,791
Our sweet Febri is in danger!

413
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,041
[gasps]

414
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,791
There was an incident
near the Reach Assembly

415
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,750
with a man who spoke
extremely unkindly to me.

416
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,666
And then...

417
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,791
Hey, is that...?

418
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,041
Hold on, what are
you planning to do?

419
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,875
I just think I should
have a word with that guy

420
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,041
about his attitude...

421
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,125
I don't like what he
said before, Kongo.

422
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,208
I really think he's
wrong about you.

423
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,416
Yes, I agree...

424
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,708
And I would like to
tell him so to his face.

425
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,916
[KONGO] Huh...? But...

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Target is currently
on the move...

427
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,375
That's right.

428
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,125
It's unfortunate that we
failed to retrieve Febri...

429
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,041
but aren't we better off
as things stand now?

430
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,541
Hmm...? Yes...

431
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,375
Yes, send them
my way... please.

432
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,083
I think there will be
some interesting results.

433
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,708
[MIKOTO] That guy wanted Febri?!

434
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,166
[KONGO] Yes, so we tried...

435
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,333
but we couldn't
reach any of you...

436
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,750
Then we decided it would
be best to split up

437
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,625
and start searching for--
[phone rings]

438
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,500
Whoops. Please excuse me.

439
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,208
Hello, this is Kongo...

440
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,083
Wannai, Awatsuki?

441
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,750
Yes, I'm so sorry...

442
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,041
I completely forgot to call you
and fill you in on everything.

443
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,875
Oh, yes, I was able to
find Misaka and the others.

444
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,541
And Febri, too...
However...

445
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,750
Well, yes. I'm doing
just fine thank you.

446
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,291
Why do you ask?

447
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,500
Please, feel free to go and
reassure your friends you're OK.

448
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,666
There's no real reason
for you to stay here.

449
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,750
I do not intend
to leave!

450
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,416
Oh, no, sorry! I was
talking to somebody else.

451
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,291
You ladies must be exhausted
after searching the city

452
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,125
for so long...! No, really.
You needn't worry about me.

453
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,000
I assure you, I'm quite well!

454
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,083
Thank you...

455
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,083
I'm sorry. I really am.
I just forgot...

456
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,625
[KONGO] Well then, as much
as I hate to leave you all...

457
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,625
I must go...

458
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,416
But if something
important comes up,

459
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,833
you'll tell me, won't you...?

460
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,458
I mean, after what's happened,

461
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,333
we're all Febri's
friends aren't we?

462
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,708
Yes... we are.

463
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,666
[UIHARU] I don't understand.

464
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,333
What does it all mean?

465
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,750
[KUROKO] Febri is a target...

466
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,375
That's what they said.

467
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,958
[SATEN] Wow,
they're really cold.

468
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,458
Acting like she's
just some thing.

469
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,625
[footsteps]

470
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,333
[FROG DOCTOR] Good morning.

471
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,000
Febri!

472
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,416
Ah, Mikoto!

473
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,916
[SATEN] Are you
feeling okay, Febri?

474
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,625
What...? Am I okay?

475
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,958
[UIHARU] Hi, sweetie...
We were worried about you.

476
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,750
You collapsed all of a sudden!

477
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,250
Gekota... are you okay?

478
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,791
[SATEN and UIHARU] Huh?

479
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,375
[KUROKO] I'm guessing that
means she feels all right now.

480
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,583
[FEBRI] Hmm?

481
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,750
[MIKOTO sighs]

482
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,166
A moment, please?

483
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,708
[SATEN] You're sure that
you don't hurt anywhere?

484
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,708
Gekota's fine!

485
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:41,833
Still as cute
as ever, huh?

486
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,000
[MIKOTO] Doctor.

487
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,000
We'd like to thank you
for all your help.

488
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,833
Please don't. I didn't
actually do anything.

489
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,541
Huh...? But you...

490
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,916
[FROG DOCTOR] I'm sorry,
but helping her

491
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,541
is beyond my capabilities...

492
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,333
I don't understand...
Is it serious?

493
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,916
Please. Surely you
can do something?

494
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,250
[FROG DOCTOR] No...

495
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,708
If it were some human
illness, I'm sure I could.

496
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,666
But the fact is...

497
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,791
She's not human.

498
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,125
Huh?

499
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:13,875
The girl has been
scientifically engineered.

500
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,083
She's a construction.

501
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,458
[MIKOTO] What?

502
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,416
[KONGO] Oh, wow!
I got the preview?

503
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,791
I was only doing what I, Mitsuko
Kongo, thought was right.

504
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,791
Next time...
I will save the world!

505
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,416
[KUROKO] Oh, just shut up!
