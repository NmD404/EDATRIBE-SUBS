1
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,166
[AMAMI] Oh, wow!

2
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,583
You know, it's hard
to believe how big

3
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,458
she's gotten after
only two weeks, isn't it?

4
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,958
[KUSAKABE] Not really.

5
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,375
She does have a ZID-02 cocktail
to stimulate her growth...

6
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,166
You've been through
training, right?

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,958
You should already be aware of
what to expect from the process.

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,583
Of course. I'm sorry...

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,125
I know all about it, I do!

10
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,833
I just got so excited,
seeing it in action.

11
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,791
Let's get started.

12
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,500
Oh, right!
I'll just go get ready.

13
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:38,625
[MIKOTO] Oooh! The sun is
almost blinding today, isn't it?

14
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,166
I know I should be
worried about sunburn,

15
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,208
but then again
that's what makes it

16
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,458
feel like summer,
don't you think?

17
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,916
[MIKOTO] Ooh!
Look it's a cicada shell!

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,208
[KUROKO] The Sissy
I know doesn't like

19
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,625
sunburns and cicada shells.

20
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,416
[MIKOTO] It's not
quite noon yet.

21
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,916
We've still got
some time.

22
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,958
[MIKOTO] Kuroko!

23
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,958
Oh! Yes, what is it?

24
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,916
[MIKOTO] What would you like?
It's my treat today!

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,375
[KUROKO] Wha-?

26
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,041
[KUROKO] She always uses
kicks on that vending machine...

27
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,083
not cash... and she's
paying for mine, too?

28
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,208
[MIKOTO] Well?

29
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,875
I-I guess I'll take
an iced coffee!

30
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,875
Oh! I am so sorry.

31
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,000
It was an accident!

32
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,625
I absolutely did not mean

33
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,416
to dive headlong
into your breasts.

34
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,166
[MIKOTO] Calm down. I know that.

35
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,416
You should be
more careful, though.

36
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,125
[MIKOTO] Okay, now
what should I get?

37
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,458
[KUROKO] Something is wrong!

38
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,500
What has come over
my dear, grouchy Sissy?

39
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,583
Could she be an imposter?

40
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,166
All right, I think I'll
go with the coconut cider.

41
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,083
You are wearing
orange underwear today...

42
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:54,416
They are polka-dotted with
a winking Gekota-- Aaah!

43
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,000
[MIKOTO]
Where did that come from?

44
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,333
[KUROKO] Just... checking...

45
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,083
It really is you.

46
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,250
[SATEN] Look! There they are!

47
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,250
Hey, sorry we're late!

48
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,541
[UIHARU] What are
you guys up to?

49
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,541
[HARU'UE]
Great looking tan, Shirai!

50
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,541
So, What do we have
on the docket for today?

51
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,833
[MIKOTO] Well, let's see...

52
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,750
I wouldn't mind
doing some shopping...

53
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,208
There are a few things
I need for our field trip.

54
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,458
[UIHARU] Yeah, that's right...

55
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,125
It's coming up soon, huh?

56
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,125
So, where are you
all going, Misaka?

57
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,625
I'm pretty sure it's
called "Liberal Arts City..."

58
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,708
[UIHARU] Oh, yeah?

59
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,375
The artificial island
in California?

60
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,000
Uh... Mhmm.

61
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,916
[HARU'UE] That's the
same place we're going!

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,291
[KUROKO] I didn't realize that.

63
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,000
[MIKOTO] How great!
We're all in the same group!

64
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,916
The five of us can hang
out the whole time...

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,333
We can eat together...
and go shopping...

66
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,416
Oh, and then there's
the beach, too.

67
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,083
[SATEN] Wow!
I'm starting to get excited!

68
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,375
Now I have an
excuse to get a new swimsuit!

69
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,416
Though maybe
I should wait on that...

70
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,583
There are a lot of other
things I need to buy first.

71
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,625
This would
be a great time

72
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,791
to have a big stack
of Money Cards.

73
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,416
You can't be serious!

74
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,708
Yeah, yeah,
I know, I know!

75
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,166
I was only kidding...

76
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,375
Anyway... what's been going
on with that case lately?

77
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,291
There have been no new
developments in a while,

78
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,208
but it hasn't been
open too long.

79
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,291
I see...

80
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,083
You're obsessing
about it, aren't you?

81
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,541
Well... I am kind of
hooked on it, yeah...

82
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,916
It's like I can sense
something bigger

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,875
lurking in the
shadows behind it!

84
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,625
So, are you basing
that on anything?

85
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,500
Just my sharp instincts
as an urban legend hunter.

86
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,458
Oh, you're starting
with that again?

87
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,833
Again?
What do you mean, again?

88
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:28,916
Please, give me an example!

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,125
[HARU'UE] Is something
bad going on?

90
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,958
[UIHARU] No, don't worry...

91
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,708
Saten just has an
overactive imagination.

92
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,250
[SATEN] Wha--Uiharu?

93
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,083
[MIKOTO] I think that's about
enough of that conversation.

94
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,000
[MIKOTO] Come on.
Let's go shopping...

95
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,625
The daylight isn't
going to last forever!

96
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,208
[KUROKO] Huh? Hey, wait for us!

97
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,875
[MIKOTO] There! I'm all set now.

98
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,083
[SATEN]
That's all you're getting?

99
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,083
[MIKOTO] Yeah.

100
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,125
There was only
one thing I needed

101
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,750
to get a little bit more of.

102
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,166
What about the rest of you guys?

103
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,208
Oh... well...

104
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,541
[KUROKO] A rice cooker?

105
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,625
[UIHARU] Yes. Ever since
we became roommates,

106
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,041
we've started cooking
at home a whole lot more.

107
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,625
But, uh... you already
have one, right?

108
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,458
Yeah, we do,
but we want another.

109
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,666
Oh... I remember.

110
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,291
Yesterday you said...
it was too small.

111
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,291
Uh-huh...

112
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,625
Sorry I eat so much.

113
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,958
[UIHARU] I'm not blaming
you at all, Haru'ue!

114
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,750
You've seen how much I eat!

115
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,208
[SATEN] Yeah, really!

116
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,166
Uiharu can be a serious glutton!

117
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,125
Excuse me?

118
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,791
[MIKOTO] Hey!

119
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,333
What do
you think of this one?

120
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,500
Now that's an
amazing machine.

121
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,875
It sure is, huh?

122
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,416
Although... It's not
really in our budget.

123
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,416
[MIKOTO] Surely you can come
down on the price just a bit...

124
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,791
You know how it is, don't you?

125
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,833
I suppose I do.

126
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,791
[KUROKO] Sissy haggling?

127
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,500
Really?

128
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,166
[HARU'UE] Wow...

129
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,875
We ended up with
a really nice one!

130
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,375
[UIHARU] I know!

131
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,583
I had no idea Misaka was
such an expert at bargaining!

132
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,291
Just think of all
the amazing things

133
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,041
we'll be able to
cook at home now!

134
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,333
We'll practically
be gourmet chefs!

135
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,916
Wow... There sure
are a lot of them.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,125
Tons and tons!

137
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,791
This place has such
a wide variety of stuff!

138
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,500
Look at this!

139
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,833
These would be too cute!
How could I ever eat them?

140
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,333
[MIKOTO] Uh... I'm just kidding!

141
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,833
I can totally eat cute cookies !

142
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,000
Whatcha think?

143
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,875
Are any of these
swimsuits the kind of thing

144
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,041
you're looking for?

145
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,416
I don't know.

146
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,416
There are so many different
styles to choose from...

147
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,625
I've never picked out a
swimsuit myself before,

148
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,208
so it's difficult.

149
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,666
Why don't you let me
give you a hand, then!

150
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,875
[MIKOTO] Are you ready? Well?

151
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,375
It's just...

152
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,958
It looks like it was
made for a little girl.

153
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,541
[MIKOTO] You think ?

154
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,750
[MIKOTO] Huh...?

155
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,500
II think we're still having
the same problem here.

156
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,166
[MIKOTO] Okay... if you say so.

157
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,458
I brought another
one you can try.

158
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,666
[UIHARU] Misaka's bouncing
off the walls today.

159
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,416
What's gotten into her?

160
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,208
Yeah, I'd noticed
that, too...

161
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,916
Do you know what's
going on, Kuroko?

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,958
[MIKOTO] This one?

163
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,166
[UIHARU] We really lucked
out with the rice cooker,

164
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,458
didn't we, Haru'ue?

165
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,541
[HARU'UE] Mm-hmm.

166
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,458
Oh, hey, I just
realized where we are...

167
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,666
This is where
I saw "you," Misaka.

168
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,375
Oh... You mean Misaka's
look-alike, or whatever?

169
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,166
Are you still going
on about that?

170
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,750
I'm serious; she was
almost identical...

171
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,708
I wonder... That's it! I know!

172
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,708
What if she's actually
your long-lost twin!

173
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,916
Oh, yeah!
Speaking of look-alikes,

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,500
I heard the craziest rumor
from Konori earlier...

175
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,416
Something about using
cloning technology

176
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,666
to mass-produce a Level Fi--

177
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,583
I mean... um...

178
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,041
Cloning, huh?

179
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,250
As far as Academy City
rumors go,

180
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,583
that one is right up there...

181
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,041
Let's see, if I had a clone,
what would I do?

182
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,250
[MIKOTO] How about you, Saten?

183
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,541
If I had a clone?

184
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,125
Well, let me see...

185
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,166
First of all, I'd have her take
care of all my summer homework.

186
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,833
I would leave
mine in our room...

187
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,416
Then I could break curfew
without getting in trouble.

188
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,958
With my own clone,

189
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,125
I could eat enough
for two people.

190
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,625
That's an awesome idea!

191
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,500
If you couldn't choose
what to eat at a restaurant,

192
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,041
you could order two dishes.

193
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,291
[MIKOTO] What if
you have it backwards

194
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,625
and each of you could
only eat half a serving?

195
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,583
[UIHARU] She has a point.

196
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,458
[HARU'UE] Yeah...
What a shame...

197
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,750
It's your turn to
answer now, Sissy.

198
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,916
What would you do if there was

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,291
a clone of you
wandering around the city?

200
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,875
[MIKOTO] That's
a good question...

201
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,916
Incredible! She looks
like a real person.

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,958
Well, sure she does.

203
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,250
She's a clone...

204
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,416
That is sort of the point.

205
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,666
As you can see...

206
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,375
her mental age is approximately
still that of a newborn.

207
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,833
She can't understand
language or walk on her own.

208
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,125
She can't do much
of anything, really.

209
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,666
[KUSAKABE] What are you doing?

210
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,083
[AMAMI] Huh? Well...

211
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,708
I was worried she might
catch a cold if she's all wet.

212
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,750
You can do things
like that for now...

213
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,666
but soon you won't have time to.

214
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,375
Word is we're creating
the rest in one batch.

215
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,250
[KUSAKABE]
Language... motor skills...

216
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,333
and ethical data are input
like this using Testament...

217
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,083
This system transmits the data
electrically via all five

218
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:44,166
senses, forcibly writing the
information into her brain.

219
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,750
Well... Keeping up so far?

220
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,208
Yeah... I was thinking
about what you said.

221
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,291
Which part?

222
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,250
Isn't the process
a bit inefficient?

223
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,666
Without repeated conditioning,

224
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,083
the data input isn't
going to take very well...

225
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,458
Shouldn't they make them in
series, according to usage?

226
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,875
The higher-ups
have their own reasons

227
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,208
for doing things...

228
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,791
They give us orders.

229
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,416
We accept them and
do what we are told.

230
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,708
[SATEN] Aww, I can't believe
the day's over already...

231
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,583
At this rate, summer vacation
will be over before we know it.

232
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,000
It's getting close
to festival time, huh?

233
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,041
Oh, yeah... It is
that time of year.

234
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,708
[UIHARU] It doesn't
really feel like it here

235
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,791
in the city, though.

236
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,625
Barely anybody
goes back home for it.

237
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,833
[MIKOTO] That's okay...

238
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,208
It means we get more
time to spend together.

239
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,791
[SATEN] Yeah, you're right!

240
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,666
[MIKOTO] Let's enjoy ourselves,
instead of counting the days.

241
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,041
[MIKOTO] There's
plenty of summer left!

242
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,500
[MAIKA] Breakfast? At this hour?

243
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,791
Well, isn't someone
living the good life!

244
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,083
[MIKOTO] And why not?

245
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,166
It's not like I have
anything else to do today.

246
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,416
What are Shirai and
the others up to?

247
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,583
Everyone's
got something...

248
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,333
Uiharu and Kuroko both
have a Judgment function ...

249
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,000
Saten and Haru'ue
already had plans too.

250
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,916
With this much free
time on your hands,

251
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,125
life must be seeming pretty
empty and isolated, huh?

252
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,208
Who asked
for your opinion?

253
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,208
[MAIKA] It doesn't matter to me.

254
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,291
Just hurry up and eat, okay?

255
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,458
Otherwise, I'll never have time

256
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,208
to get everything
straightened up.

257
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,375
[MIKOTO] Jeez...

258
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,708
I can't even enjoy
a leisurely meal now?

259
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,833
[MAIKA] Do you seriously not
have anything better to do?

260
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,375
[MIKOTO] I'm sure
I can find something.

261
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,583
Hey... How come...?

262
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,666
It sucks when
you're all ready to read

263
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,458
your favorite magazine,
and then you realize

264
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,666
it's the same double issue
from the week before.

265
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,166
I'm so bored.

266
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,458
[GIRL A] Really?

267
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,750
Uh... what's up?

268
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,750
You're that
same girl. Right?

269
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,625
We helped you find your bag .

270
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,375
Since you don't
have anything else to do,

271
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,375
I think you should come and play
with us!

272
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,625
Uh, sorry, I'm actually
kind of busy, you see...

273
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,625
[PINK RIBBON GIRL]
You fibber!

274
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,166
I just heard you
say you're bored!

275
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,791
Yeah!

276
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,833
[MIKOTO] What can I say to that?

277
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,958
All right, Big Sister
will play with you.

278
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,708
[CHILDREN] Hooray!

279
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,250
Ha! Our "Big Sister," huh?

280
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,666
She's at that age.

281
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,041
They like to start thinking
that they're grown-ups.

282
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,791
[BANDAID BOY] Wait up!

283
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,166
[MIKOTO] No way!

284
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,666
[BANDAID BOY]
Rats! She did it to us again!

285
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,000
[MIKOTO] Go on...
hurry and get away!

286
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,916
It's not fair when
you kick it so far!

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,875
Do you always hafta' try
so hard against little kids?

288
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,291
Sorry... but you wouldn't
want me to go around

289
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,708
acting like I'm a
grown-up, would you?

290
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,666
You're a big jerk!
A stupid- dummy head!

291
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,708
I'm rubber,
you're glue...

292
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,916
You're ugly and
you smell funny!

293
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,041
[MIKOTO] What did you
call me, you little brat?

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,125
How does that bratty,

295
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,041
smart-talking mouth
of yours like this, huh?

296
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,041
Cut it out you big,
stupid freak!

297
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,666
Someday, I'll become a Level 5,

298
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,666
and then I'm gonna get
back at you for this!

299
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,375
I'll take you on any
time you want, short stuff.

300
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,750
Big Sis!

301
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,375
You've got an ability.

302
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,458
You're a big-shot
electrical user, aren't you?

303
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,291
I guess.

304
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,458
Oh, really?
That's Nao's ability, too.

305
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,916
[MIKOTO] Is that right?

306
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,791
But look.

307
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,833
No matter how hard I try,
that's all I can do.

308
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,083
That's the same for
everyone at the beginning...

309
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,625
Keep practicing, and you'll
be able to do lots of things.

310
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,958
What kinda things?

311
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,958
Like, will Nao be able
to "cell phone" with you?

312
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,250
"Cell phone"?

313
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,541
You know, use
electricity to talk.

314
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,458
Oh... No, sorry.

315
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,666
I can't even tell where someone

316
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,583
is using my ability,
much less talk to them.

317
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,083
Not even a little?

318
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,166
[MIKOTO] If there was
no interference at all...

319
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,500
like if we were out at sea...
it might be possible.

320
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,083
[MIKOTO] But here in the city,

321
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,750
where EM waves are
flying around all over,

322
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,166
there's just too
much noise for that.

323
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,000
Hmm? Oh... okay...

324
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,166
[MIKOTO] Although...

325
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,166
there was the case
of the Level Uppers...

326
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,708
As long as the brainwaves'
waveforms were close,

327
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,125
they might be able to
construct a network...

328
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,000
[MIKOTO]
Like that'll ever happen.

329
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,416
Good morning.
Do you know what that means?

330
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,375
"A routine beginning
of daily conversation.

331
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,041
Otherwise known as a greeting,"
affirms Misaka swiftly.

332
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,875
Your specimen number?

333
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,041
Specimen number
nine-nine-eight-two.

334
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,166
It appears that
you're plugged into

335
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,291
the Misaka Net, all right...

336
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,958
Here you go, start
by putting this on.

337
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,375
Uh, I'm sorry...

338
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,333
All this shameless nudity is
kind of making me uncomfortable.

339
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,250
Really?

340
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,208
[AMAMI] Couldn't we add
maybe a touch of modesty

341
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,208
when it comes to
displaying the body?

342
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,291
[KUSAKABE] If we add any
unnecessary emotions

343
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,375
and then they rebel,
that would be problematic.

344
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,291
The "safety devices"
aren't exactly perfect.

345
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,416
Oh... is that right?

346
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,125
It's true... Besides,
we couldn't do it...

347
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,458
You and I don't have
the necessary skills...

348
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,083
That machine over there.

349
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,416
It was overseen by
Nuno-something-or-other...

350
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,875
the girl genius...

351
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,750
and even she just
barely got it functioning.

352
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,958
[AMAMI] Oh...

353
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,541
[MIKOTO] Children sure
have a lot of energy.

354
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,291
Me too. And it's
really warm out here.

355
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,708
[MIKOTO] Young lady!

356
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,666
This is very important: from
whom did you get that button?

357
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,666
[BLUE RIBBON GIRL] Huh?

358
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,291
I got it from the
vending machines

359
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,250
in the shopping district.

360
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,291
[MIKOTO] It's the type
where you have to turn

361
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,458
the knob to drop the capsule.

362
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,791
With something this low-tech,

363
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,291
my ability's not going
to be of any use at all...

364
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,125
Well, here goes.

365
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,000
[WOMAN 4-A] Look at that!

366
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,500
There's a girl from
Tokiwadai at the toy machine.

367
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,916
[WOMAN 4-B] I see her...

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,583
I'm sure she's buying them for
those children, though.

369
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,208
[MIKOTO] This is ridiculous...
Not a single one.

370
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,708
You, kid,
go get me change!

371
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,833
Huh? Why should I get y--

372
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,708
Did you see her eyes?

373
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,833
Just do it, man.

374
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,166
Okay. Good call.

375
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,208
[GIRL A] Wow.

376
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,916
There weren't any in there, huh?

377
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,875
Well, um...

378
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,833
If you want to,
I can trade you for--

379
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,083
[GIRL A] I forgot!

380
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,333
There are more in front
of the train station.

381
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,583
You got it! Good job!

382
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,958
Isn't it pretty?

383
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,375
[CHILDREN thinking]
It's over... It's finally over.

384
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,291
[PINK RIBBON GIRL]
I'll go get some bags

385
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,625
or something to carry 'em in.

386
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,833
[BANDAID BOY]
Yeah, me too.

387
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,083
Well... now
that I've finally gotten it...

388
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,166
What am
I going to do with it?

389
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,458
[MIKOTO] Collector's fever:
That unfortunate condition

390
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,583
that drives sufferers
to obtain every product

391
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,375
even remotely related to the
subject of their obsession,

392
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,583
regardless of the consequences.

393
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,041
[MIKOTO] Even I know
that wearing it on my shirt

394
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,000
like this little girl would be
pathetic and embarrassing...

395
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,916
Really... I can just
imagine the pitiful look

396
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,208
Kuroko will give me
when she sees this.

397
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,750
[Another one, Sissy?

398
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,458
[MIKOTO] Yeah...
but if I put it on a bag...

399
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,125
that might be just
barely cool, right?

400
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,208
[GIRL A] Oh, wow.
I didn't know how late it was!

401
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,791
We have to go home
or we'll get in trouble.

402
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,791
[MIKOTO] Well, there
went my entire day.

403
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,416
[BLUE RIBBON GIRL] Hey!

404
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,625
If you're at the pool
and you go underwater,

405
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,791
how long can you
hold your breath?

406
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,416
[GIRL A] We played
for hours and hours!

407
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,875
[MIKOTO] Just because
you're on vacation

408
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,208
doesn't mean you can
do nothing but play games...

409
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,041
You have to do your
summer homework too.

410
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,666
[GIRL A] What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

411
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,333
Oh... no.
Everything's just fine.

412
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,875
Come on, let's go.

413
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,458
[GIRL A]
Goodbye, Big Sister!

414
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,041
Thanks for playing today!

415
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,958
[MIKOTO] Any time. And you'll
be careful going home, right?

416
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,000
[CHILDREN] Yep!

417
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,041
[MIKOTO] Okay...
now what was that before?

418
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,708
A power very
similar to mine... no...

419
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,166
It felt like my own power
was washing over me

420
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,875
from the outside in.

421
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,333
[MIKOTO] It's not possible.

422
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,333
[MIKOTO] There's no way...
Except... except...!

423
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,625
[AMAMI] Let's see...

424
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,208
There.
That looks about right...

425
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,750
One last thing...

426
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,708
[KUSAKABE]
Muscle strength, stamina,

427
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,125
and cardiovascular
endurance all check out...

428
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,875
You still need to pass your
interpersonal response test...

429
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:40,208
After that you can move
on to external training.

430
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,541
[MISAKA 9982]
Misaka has already mastered

431
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,500
every possible situation...

432
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,375
from ordering a hamburger...
to spotting a con-artist...

433
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,083
She is confident
that she can blend in

434
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,083
with people in
the outside world.

435
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,375
Therefore, she has some doubts

436
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,375
as to the necessity
of such a test.

437
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,083
You're not prepared
for everything...

438
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,541
There are times on the outside

439
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,916
when what you learned using
Testament will not work...

440
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,666
Maybe... if you were to run into
the Original, for example...

441
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,416
Though that's not likely.

442
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,875
Well... even if
that does happen,

443
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,250
it shouldn't interfere
with the experiment.

444
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,750
[MISAKA 9982] "What is
the Original?" Misaka asks.

445
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,250
Good question.

446
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,708
She's the model
for the Sisters...

447
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,625
I guess you could say she's...

448
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,458
sort of like your older sister.

449
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,583
[MISAKA 9982] Older sister...

450
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,416
[MIKOTO] Around here...
This is where it came from.

451
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,625
[MIKOTO] Who... are you?

452
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:31,000
[KUSAKABE] Hmm...
Now for your clothing...

453
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,708
You've been provided
with an outfit...

454
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,541
so go ahead and change.

455
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,666
[KUSAKABE]
Oh... uh... actually...

456
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,416
Would you mind
cleaning those up first?

457
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,625
You know... before
the next experiment.

458
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,166
[MISAKA 9982]
Misaka understands.

459
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,083
[MIKOTO] What is this?

460
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,375
The same face...
The same hair...

461
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,208
She looks just like
me in every way...

462
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,708
Who are you? Tell me!

463
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,416
[KUROKO] Uh, Sissy... Why are
you yelling at the mirror?
