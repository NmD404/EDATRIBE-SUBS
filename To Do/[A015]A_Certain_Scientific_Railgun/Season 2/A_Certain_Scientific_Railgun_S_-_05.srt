1
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,750
Around here...
This is where it came from.

2
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,000
Who... are you?

3
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,166
[MIKOTO] What are you?

4
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,333
Mya.

5
00:00:58,875 --> 00:00:59,958
Huh?

6
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,458
[MIKOTO] "Mya"?

7
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,791
So... what does that mean?

8
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,125
Is it her name?

9
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,125
The organization she's with?

10
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,458
Or did I mishear what she said?

11
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,875
Maybe it was a
different language?

12
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,000
"Mya," says the furry,
four-legged creature

13
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,625
caught up in a tree.

14
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,000
[meows]

15
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:50,958
[MIKOTO] A cat?

16
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,208
A little earlier today,

17
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,416
I was passing
through this area...

18
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,208
As I did, I noticed a
baby who was left alone

19
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,333
inside a car that was
parked on the street.

20
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,833
The baby could have
suffered a heat stroke.

21
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,250
So Misaka used her
electrical power to unlock

22
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,250
the door and open
the window, but...

23
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,583
[MISAKA 9982] The poor
creature was startled

24
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,250
and fled up the tree.

25
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,708
He was then unable
to climb back down...

26
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:20,208
"You see?" asks Misaka, having
fully explained the situation.

27
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:24,750
Ah... Wait, that's not
what I was asking about!

28
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,166
I want to know what the deal
is with you, not the cat!

29
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,416
Look at him.

30
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,291
His situation becomes
more precarious.

31
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,375
"Shouldn't we see

32
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,791
if we can help him
get down?" asks--

33
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,041
He's a cat!

34
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,750
Being up in a tree isn't
a big deal to him, okay?

35
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,375
So, why don't you just
tell me what you're...

36
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,833
Oh, I see...

37
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,541
So, Big Sister, you do not
care if this creature slips

38
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,375
from the branch,
falls out of the tree,

39
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,916
and is violently
smashed on the ground?

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,541
If, as a result,

41
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,250
his internal organs
are seriously injured,

42
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,791
and he is unable
to survive on his own,

43
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,666
that does not concern you?

44
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,625
Okay, you win...

45
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,125
What do you want me to do?

46
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,750
"You could get on
your hands and knees

47
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,000
in front of the tree...

48
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,750
Then I should be
able to reach it...

49
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,541
Right?" Misaka
seeks confirmation.

50
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,875
Well...

51
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,541
I'm not really seeing
anything else around here

52
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,625
that could give us
enough of a boost.

53
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,500
[MIKOTO] Wait...
why am I on the bottom?

54
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,250
Could you move a little further
to the left, Big Sister?

55
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,875
[MIKOTO] You've gotta
be kidding me!

56
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,375
Yeah, I'm fine,
thank you!

57
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,416
[MISAKA 9982]
I have managed

58
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,583
to safely secure the
creature... See?

59
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,000
Hey, come on!

60
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,416
You can't just go around
holding up your skirt like that!

61
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,833
You're supposed
to be a young lady!

62
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,375
You need to behave if you're
gonna go around lookin' like me!

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,125
[meows]

64
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,875
[MIKOTO] Aw, just
look at this sweet guy!

65
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,000
He's a cute little
kitty-kiddy, huh?

66
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,125
Kitty-kiddy?

67
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,541
Yeah, he's a cat's
kid: a kitty-kiddy.

68
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,625
It's too bad cats are
always spooked by me.

69
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,125
They aren't crazy about

70
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,875
the slight electrical field
my body constantly produces.

71
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,041
The same is true
for Misaka, it seems.

72
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,750
Hey!

73
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,500
You keep distracting me
and dodging my question!

74
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,791
You've been referring
to yourself as Misaka.

75
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,666
So, are you...
are you my... my...

76
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you my clone?

77
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,458
Yes.

78
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,791
[MIKOTO] Oh... kay.

79
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,541
But I thought that project

80
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,958
was supposed to have
been frozen for good.

81
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,916
In which case... why does
someone like you even exist?

82
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:50,541
"ZXC741. ASD852.
QWE963-Dash. Well?"

83
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,833
Misaka seeks
password confirmation.

84
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,750
What?

85
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,416
[MISAKA 9982] Your inability
to respond means that

86
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,541
you are not involved
in the experiment...

87
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,083
and so I cannot answer
your question, Big Sister.

88
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,083
Well, then you can
at least tell me

89
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,833
who is in charge
of this project.

90
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,625
That is confidential.

91
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,208
What is the purpose
of your creation?

92
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,166
That is confidential, too.

93
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,333
You want to get
hurt, is that it?

94
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,958
If I have to force
it out of you...

95
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,833
[MIKOTO] Okay, fine...
Get going.

96
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,208
All I have to do is
follow where you lead...

97
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,083
You must be heading back
to whatever laboratory

98
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,583
is responsible for creating you.

99
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,791
When I get there,

100
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,708
I'll start by collecting
your manufacturers.

101
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,791
They can give me
the answers I want.

102
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,416
[MIKOTO] Sisters...

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,750
[MIKOTO] If she
wasn't right here...

104
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,583
I don't know if
I would believe it.

105
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,541
[MIKOTO] No...
I guess that's not true...

106
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,000
For a while now,
I've been frightened

107
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,000
that exactly this sort of
thing was going to happen.

108
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,833
That someone who looked
just like me would show up.

109
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,291
[MIKOTO] Although...

110
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,958
I didn't expect...
something like this.

111
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,375
[MIKOTO] I thought it would be
more sinister and sophisticated.

112
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,666
[MIKOTO] Like some sort
of black op where they plot

113
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,333
to put someone to death
and then replace them

114
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,458
with an identical twin who has
been subverted by the enemy.

115
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,750
[MIKOTO] But this has
me completely thrown off.

116
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,916
[MIKOTO] Wait, "Sister...s"!

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,125
[MIKOTO] Hey! Hold on!

118
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,500
[MIKOTO] I... just need
to know one thing!

119
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,208
Okay, this might sound crazy...

120
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,166
but am I gonna find
another five or ten others

121
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,916
like you somewhere out there?

122
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,125
"Kitty-kiddy."
If you say it backwards,

123
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,666
it still sounds almost
exactly the same.

124
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,958
Stop trying
to avoid the subject!

125
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,291
[MISAKA 9982] "Kitty-kiddy."

126
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,416
[MIKOTO] Quit saying that!
I asked you a question!

127
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,416

128
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,708
[MIKOTO] Oh, come oooonnnn!

Hey! What's going on?

130
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:23,916
[ICE CREAM MAN 5-A]
It's a shame

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,125
to see sisters
fighting like that.

132
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,375
[MIKOTO] She is not my sister!

133
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,958
Hey... That's the kinda thing

134
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,291
you should never say, especially
if you're angry. Wait one sec.

135
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,291
[ICE CREAM MAN 5-A]
Here you go.

136

[MIKOTO] Um...

137
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,416
[ICE CREAM MAN 5-A]
These are my best cones.

138
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,083
You two eat them
and stop fighting.

139
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,416
Uh...

140
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,541
That's nice of you,
but I don't think ice cream

141
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,458
is exactly what we need, here.

142
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,416
A rich and
refreshing sweetness

143
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,625
without an
overbearing aftertaste...

144
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,833
Clearly, quality
milk was used...

145
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,791
and this kind of texture
cannot be achieved

146
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,458
without well-ground sugar...

147
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,291
Furthermore, the cone
is flavorful enough

148
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,291
to be a cookie in its own right.

149
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,833
[MISAKA 9982]
"Excellent job!" reports Misaka,

150
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,833
offering her sincerest praise.

151
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,458
Well, thank you.

152
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,208
Now... when a couple breaks up,

153
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,166
they can just go back
to being strangers,

154
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,291
But sisters share
their blood for life.

155
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,625
If I don't start charging
for the ice cream,

156
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,916
my old lady might
become a stranger again.

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,458
Uh... that
sounds personal.

00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,375
[ICE CREAM MAN 5-A]
Anyway, you sisters be good!

we are not sisters!

else is he going to think?

"No, sir, our genes
are totally identical,

but we're not sisters,
I promise!"

163
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,250
[MIKOTO] Huh?

164
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,625
Hey, you!

165
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,000
"Is something the matter?"

166
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,375
asks Misaka, playing
innocent while enjoying

167
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,083
the mint chocolate chip
aftertaste... secretly.

168

If that's really the case,

how can you be such
a gluttonous pig--

"Eating ice cream
has made me a bit chilly.

Big Sister's bad attitude.

173
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,416

175
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,375
but I am pretty
particular about my tea,"

176
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,791
reports Misaka, considerately
offering up a disclaimer.

177
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,375
[MISAKA 9982] "If it helps, I
will be ordering milk tea,"

178
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,750
says Misaka, in an effort
to streamline the process.

179
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,916
[MIKOTO] Stop screwing with me!

180
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,833
[MISAKA 9982] "That milk tea
was more than satisfactory...

181
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,500
as was the strawberry
shortcake on the side,"

182
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,666
remarks Misaka,
offering her candid opinion.

183
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,250
[MIKOTO] So, When are you going
back to wherever you belong?

184
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,833
[MISAKA 9982]
I forgot to mention this...

185
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,458
but Misaka is now headed
for her experiment...

186
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,250
so she will not be returning.

187
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,333
[MIKOTO] Huh?

188
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,583
You're free to
follow me, Big Sister,

189
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,208
if that is what
you wish to do,

190
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,541
but you will not
see Misaka's creator.

191
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,000
But... why didn't
you tell me...?

192
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,083
I didn't say because
you didn't ask.

193
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,500
[MIKOTO] So what now?

194
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,291
Would it be quicker to
decode her password

195
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,666
and search for more
information that way?

196
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,625
I do have my PDA with me.

197
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,625
[MISAKA 9982]
What is that object?

198
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,791
This? It's a prize

199
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,083
I got from a vending
machine, that's all.

200
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,041
[MISAKA 9982]
What are you doing?

201
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,416
[MIKOTO] Just hold
still a sec, will you?

202
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,083
There. This should give
me a much clearer picture

203
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,708
than looking in
a mirror would...

204
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,458
Seeing it like this,
it's not so bad, really.

205
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,833
"No, it's worse than bad,"

206
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,666
Misaka says,
shocked and appalled

207
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,500
by her model's absolute
lack of fashion sense.

208
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,583
Uh... excuse me?

209
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,208
Well, obviously,
I was just kidding around.

210
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,791
Come on... 

211
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:31,833
[MIKOTO] You know it's bad if
your own clone shoots you down.

212
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,083
did you actually
think I was serious?

213
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,125
Geez, what is with you?

214
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,791
"The moment you
put it on Misaka,

215
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,916
ownership of this
button transferred to her,"

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,166
Misaka calmly asserts.

217
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,291
If Big Sister attempts
to take it back,

218
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,625
she is guilty of robbery.

219
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,208
Please, that's ridiculous.

220
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,458
[MISAKA 9982] "No, it is a
true statement... Besides,"

221
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,125
adds Misaka,
"This holds special importance

222
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,916
as the first present
given to me by Big Sister."

223
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,833
"Though one would think
she could have found

224
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,541
something better to
give me than this...

225
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,958
Would that really have
been so much trouble?"

226
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,875
asks Misaka, with a sigh.

227
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,208
Alright, you give that
back to me right now!

228
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,500
[MIKOTO] Calm down...

229
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,916
You're letting her
distract you again...

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,625
At this rate, I'm not
going to get anywhere...

231
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,416
I should just check the net.

232
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,916
[MIKOTO] Okay, fine...
It's getting late.

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,166
I'm gonna call
it quits for today.

234
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,333
Uh... Unless there
was something else?

00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,541
No.

make of the day I just had.

Eating ice cream cones...
Fighting over a button...

like we were...

times you've helped me out!

than happy to give you

recruiting drive took up

250

I thought it would.

without your help!

calling you so late.

straight to the point, okay?

00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,208
Or are you ready to give
in and declare defeat?

Misaka... does not...

have an accurate grasp...
of the target's ability...

346
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,583
however... judging from
experimental results...

347
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,875
up to now...

348
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,916
[MISAKA 9982] Misaka has
come to the conclusion that...

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,083
the target projects
some kind of barrier...

350
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,583
around himself...

351
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,708
Furthermore... seeing as how...

352
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,041
he steps on the ground...
when he walks...

353
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,166
[MISAKA 9982] Misaka believes...

354
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,000
That his ability...
does not extend downward...

355
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,875
or at least, not beyond
the soles of his feet.

356
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,750
[MISAKA 9982]
Therefore, Misaka determined,

357
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,208
a surprise attack
from that direction...

358
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,916
would prove to be
the most effective.

359
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,291
[ACCELERATOR] Hey, what are
you mumbling about over there?

If you won't run,
I'll finish you off.

[MISAKA 9982] I am not
running... anymore.

[MISAKA 9982]
As per my plan...

to the desired location...

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,208
Now... there is only one
more thing left to do.

366
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,125
Mission complete...

367
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,083
The target has been neutrali--

368
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,125
Oh. Hi.

369
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,000
It was a nice idea...

370
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,500
But so incredibly
far off the mark!

371
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,458
Aww, now we can't
play tag anymore, huh?

372

if I just leave you there

374
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,875
but standing around waiting
really isn't my thing.

375
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,708
[ACCELERATOR] Well... still
trying to run away, huh?

376
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,250
That way is a dead-end, though.

Do you have some
other pathetic,

378
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,541
useless trick hidden
up your sleeve, maybe?

379
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,000
[ACCELERATOR] We've
played for long enough now.

380
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,458
[ACCELERATOR] I think
it's time to say good bye.

Oh, no!

No! It can't be...!

No!!

quite a mess this time.

I wonder how long it'll
take them to clean it up.
