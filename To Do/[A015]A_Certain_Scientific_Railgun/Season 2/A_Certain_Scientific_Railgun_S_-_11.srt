1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,250
[KAMIJO] Come on!

2
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,500
What is with
this thing?

3
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,375
[MIKOTO] Is that...

4
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,500
[THUG S1 4-A] We got
ourselves a cutie here...

5
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,000
Oooh... and she's
from Tokiwadai, too.

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,458
[THUG S1 4-B] Wanna come with
us; have some fun tonight?

7
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,250
[THUG S1 4-C] We'll even
take you back to your dorm...

8
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,916
Of course, there's no telling
how late it might be by then.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,583
[THUGS laugh]

10
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,041
[MIKOTO] What do
these idiots think

11
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,666
they're going to accomplish
by talking to me?

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,625
Pathetic.

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,791
Everyone else is
pretending not to see.

14
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,291
It's not that they don't care.

15
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,291
They just can't do
anything about it.

16
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,416
If they interfered, they'd
only get themselves hurt.

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,291
And that wouldn't help anyone.

18
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,000
Everyone has to look
out for themselves...

19
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,625
That's the way it works.

20
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,208
And if there is somebody
out there who would

21
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,291
jump in the middle of this
to help out a stranger...

22
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,875
Well, that person
is just a fool.

23
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,916
[KAMIJO] Oh, hey, there you are!

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,416
Thanks for keeping
her company, guys!

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,750
You shouldn't wander
off like that.

26
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,041
You know how much I worry!

27
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,375
I gave it
plenty of money.

28
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,583
I don't understand...!

29
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,375
Is it out of order?

30
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,291
Seriously?!

31
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,541
Heh.

32
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,416
[KAMIJO] Please don't
screw with me today...

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,791
Give me back my money!

34
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,333
[MIKOTO] Are you done yet?

35
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,500
You just going to stand
there like an idiot...?

36
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,291
Are you gonna buy
something or not?

37
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,875
What...? Hold on...

38
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,916
[MIKOTO] I seriously
need to rehydrate.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,416
If I don't get a drink, I could
pass out at any given moment.

40
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,375
You're one rude chick.

41
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:33,416
[MIKOTO] When will you get it
through your thick skull?

42
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,875
My name is Mikoto Misaka!

43
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,333
Is it really that hard
for you to remember?!

44
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,458
Great.

45
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,416
So I guess that hasn't
changed either, huh...?

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,416
Why is it that my shocks
have no effect on you?

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,958
[KAMIJO] I don't know!

48
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,958
But it serves you right for
using your ability like that!

49
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,291
[MIKOTO] Well...

50
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,083
if you're done, I'm going
to get what I came for.

51
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,583
I've got some serious business
with this vending machine.

52
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,500
[KAMIJO] Uh...
about this machine...

53
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,291
It has a tendency
to eat your money.

54
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,041
Not five minutes ago, it took
mine and gave me nothing.

55
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,041
So, you
got yoinked?

56
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,625
Well, what was
the damage...?

57
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,041
How much did
it take you for?

58
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,333
2000.

59
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,583
Wow! 2000?!

60
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,125
You gave it that big of a bill?

61
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,708
[MIKOTO laughs]

62
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,333
Then of course it ate
your money, you idiot!

63
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,583
I can't tell you how
much I needed a laugh...

64
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,875
So... I'll get you
your money's worth.

65
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:35,458
[KAMIJO] Eh?

66
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,333
Yeah...

67
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,708
This machine and I go way back.

68
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,958
You wouldn't believe
how much money I--

69
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,000
[KAMIJO] Hmm?

70
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,250
[MIKOTO] Uh, never mind...

71
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,750
Anyway, like I said,

72
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,458
I'm going to make this thing
give you what you paid for.

73
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,625
Uh, you know...

74
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,291
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

75
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,708
Just forget it.

76
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,833
[MIKOTO] Hah!

77
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,958
[CLERK 11-A]
Thank you for waiting.

78
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,416
[SATEN] No problem.

79
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:01,916
[UIHARU] So, that's it?

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,500
She's back to normal,
just like that?

81
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,791
Uh-huh.

82
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,500
And just when I had
decided to leave her alone

83
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,041
and wait for her
to confide in me.

84
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,083
There's no reason for Sissy
to know how worried I've been.

85
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,583
All that would do is
make her worry, instead.

86
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,958
[KUROKO sighs]

87
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,166
I just hope we never have
to go through that again.

88
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,750
[SATEN] Hmm...

89
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,833
Let's recap: she went out last
night without eating anything...

90
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,875
She didn't give us
any details about

91
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,041
where she was going or
what she was doing...

92
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,375
It fits.

93
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,875
I'm sure now. There can
only be one explanation...

94
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,500
There's a boy involved...

95
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,916
There must be.
I wonder who it is.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,291
Oh...! W-W-Wow!

97
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,250
Absolutely not!
There's no boy!

98
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,500
That's why she's been acting
so strangely because--

99
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,875
That's right. Because
she's lovestruck.

100
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,458
It all makes
sense now...!

101
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,791
Why she was
sneaking around.

102
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,875
Why she couldn't turn
to any of us for advice.

103
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,875
Why she kept it all
completely secret...

104
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,916
[SATEN] I know!

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,875
[UIHARU] I wonder what type
of boy Misaka would choose.

106
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll bet he's a
gallant young gentleman

107
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,250
and as handsome
as a prince, too!

108
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,041
Well, handsome is
always a plus...

109
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,833
but I think Misaka would
also want to go out with a guy

110
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,041
who was intelligent
and interesting.

111
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,041
[UIHARU gasps]

112
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,791
Wait...! She stays
out all night

113
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,666
and doesn't come home
until morning...

114
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,125
You don't think she could be...

115
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,041
[SATEN] Are you okay, Uiharu?

116
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,375
[KUROKO] No... there's no way...

117
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,916
Of all people, Sissy wouldn't...

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,416
[alarm sounds]

119
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,291
An alarm?

120
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,916
What the... you
guys are really quick.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,458
[UIHARU] Just listen...

122
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,875
That sounds like an alarm from
a vending machine, right...?

123
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,500
Well, what do you think?

124
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,708
[KUROKO] A vending machine
in that direction...?

125
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,458
Could it be...?

126
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,083
So, what should
we do, Shirai?

127
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,958
I'm gonna go see what
might've set it off.

128
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,458
Well then,
I'll come, too.

129
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,625
That's okay If I need
backup, I'll contact you.

130
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,750
Hold on!

131
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,500
[MIKOTO] Wait up...!

132
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,583
What are you so scared of?

133
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,166
I can't... run any farther...

134
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,416
[MIKOTO] Honestly!

135
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,291
You could at least help
me carry all this stuff!

136
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,666
I did my part.

137
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,458
I made that machine cough up
everything it owed you.

138
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,208
Well, I didn't
want to steal any--

139
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,041
[MIKOTO] Technically, they
already belong to you.

140
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,291
If I accept this,
I'm not a bystander,

141
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,083
but an accomplice.

142
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,083
[MIKOTO] Here.

143
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,291
There's more where
that came from.

144
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,125
[KAMIJO] Whoa!

145
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,791
Hold on! Hold on...! Ow...!

146
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,875
There are some hot
ones in there, too!

147
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,916
[MIKOTO] It's not my fault.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,583
I can't choose what kind of
drink it spits out, you know.

149
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,375
What's with
you, anyway?

150
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,875
The littlest thing is enough
to send you running...

151
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,916
It doesn't help my pride
that the guy who beat me

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,166
is a big crybaby!

153
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,458
[KAMIJO] Huh?
What did you say?

154
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,333
Please! Don't act like
you don't remember.

155
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,458
You managed to defeat me, both
in town and out by the riverbed.

156
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,291
Wait, so I've been
getting into fights

157
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,708
with a middle-school girl?

158
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,208
Really?

159
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,916
You're actually trying to
pretend that you've forgotten?

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,833
How pathetic can you be?

161
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,916
[KAMIJO] What have I been doing?

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,416
Whatever,
just drink...

163
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,666
You should
be thankful.

164
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,166
I can think of at least
one girl who would swoon

165
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,666
to get a present
from me.

166
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,208
Aw, gimme a break.

167
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,041
This isn't some manga...

168
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,750
Girls don't actually "swoon."

169
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,500
Heh... if only that were true.

170
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,916
Of course, you probably
don't know what they call me

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,416
at Tokiwadai Middle
School, do you?

172
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,625
[KUROKO] Hi, Sissyyyyy!

173
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,041
I heard a vending machine
alarm, so I came running.

174
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,250
And sure enough, here you are!

175
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,666
[MIKOTO] Here we go.
Speak of the devil...

176
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,583
[KAMIJO] What's up?

177
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,666
[MIKOTO] Uh,
something wrong, Kuro--

178
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,541
Geez! What's the
matter with you?

179
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,916
I thought she was wrong...
but it's true...!

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,166
How awful!

181
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,000
You're having a secret
assignation with a boy!

182
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,500
[MIKOTO] Hold on a minute!

183
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,666
It's a pleasure to meet
you, gentleman caller.

184
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,875
Whoa,
what now?

185
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,458
The name's Kuroko Shirai,

186
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,083
and I have the honor of being
Mikoto's right hand gal.

187
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,125
Her one and only
partner. Forever.

188
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,083
As you appear to be an
acquaintance of Sissy's,

189
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,583
I am bound by social etiquette

190
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,291
to at least introduce
myself to you.

191
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,791
Uh... okay...

192
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,875
[KUROKO] Are you kidding me?

193
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,083
He's not exactly what you
would call "impressive."

194
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:12,666
Could someone like him
really be with Sissy?

195
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,250
My, it doesn't take very much
to incapacitate him, does it?

196
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,333
I thought you would have
had better taste than this.

197
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,166
[MIKOTO] Excuse me?

198
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,916
Do you seriously think a
blithering idiot like this

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,541
is my boyfriend?
How stupid can you be?!

200
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,416
[KAMIJO] Wait! Your what?!

201
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,166
[KUROKO] No, of
course I didn't...!

202
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,875
I thought it seemed
like a strange pairing.

203
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,041
[MIKOTO] Come on!

204
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,041
Get back down here!

205
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,375
[KUROKO] Let me think.

206
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,583
Of course, I would love
for you to wash your hands

207
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,083
of this troglodyte

208
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,000
and allow me to escort you
back home to our room, but...

209
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,458
it might be best for you
to build up some immunity

210
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:53,708
to the charms of men so you are
not led further astray later on.

211
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,000
And, really...

212
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,750
I don't think I have
anything to fear from this

213
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,583
helpless, goofy little monkey...

214
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,708
In fact, it's possible that
he's so pathetic that you will

215
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,666
become disillusioned
with men in general,

216
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,291
and then I will be
there to console you!

217
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,083
[KUROKO laughs]

218
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,666
[KUROKO] And, besides...

219
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,458
You finally seem
like yourself again.

220
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,666
[MIKOTO] I said,
are you listening?!

221
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,250
[KUROKO] I have nothing
more to say...

222
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,958
and, as I have some things to
attend to, I will take my leave.

223
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,291
I'm sure I can trust you not to

224
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,791
embarrass yourself
here, Sissy...

225
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,000
[MIKOTO] Hey...!

226
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,208
--So Good-bye.
--What do you mean by that?!

227
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,000
[KAMIJO] She vanished!

228
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,750
[MIKOTO] Saying something like
that, and then running away!

229
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,666
So there are people in real life
who use the term "Sissy"...

230
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,000
I had no idea...

231
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,125
You Tokiwadai girls
are something else.

232
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,041
She's actually sort
of a special case.

233
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,541
Oh... Is she?

234
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,041
[MIKOTO] Oh, man!
Why am I here?

235
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,833
I need some rest.

236
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,708
[MISAKA 10031] Big Sister?

237
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,000
[KAMIJO] She's back--
Wait... what the...?

238
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,583
You mean...
There's another Zapper?

239
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,083
[MISAKA 10031] "Our appearances
are, indeed, similar.

240
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,541
Which makes sense, as we
are entirely identical

241
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:08,375
on a genetic level."
Offers Misaka in reply.

242
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,666
[KAMIJO] Huh?
A genetic level...?

243
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,333
Oh, ah! So you
guys're twins, huh?

244
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,750
Moments ago...
I identified a power

245
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,458
identical to Misaka's
being used in the area.

246
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,208
When I arrived, I found
a broken vending machine.

247
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,916
And now I see you with
all of these beverages.

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,083
Big Sister, I hope I
am wrong in suspecting

249
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,291
that you are an
accomplice to theft.

250
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,208
[KAMIJO] Hey...!

251
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,583
Your sister is
the perpetrator!

252
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,416
I'm an innocent bystander!

253
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,083
Misaka investigated...

254
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,666
I checked for fingerprints
using my ability.

255
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,833
The results showed that the most
recent set belonged to you.

256
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,916
No way! You can actually tell?

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,500
Kidding.

258
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,708
Not laughing...!

259
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,291
Give me a break...!

260
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,291
This sister of yours
could stand to learn...

261
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,500
Uh...

262
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,875
[MIKOTO] Why...?

263
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,041
Of all places...

264
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,541
[MIKOTO] What are you doing
wandering around out here?

265
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,875
[MISAKA 10031] I am
here for training.

266
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,416
But--

267
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,375
What are you
training for...?

268
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,625
Are you joining
Judgment or something?

269
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,291
[MIKOTO] Judgment?

270
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh, yeah...
that's what this is.

271
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,750
Come on. Let's talk.

272
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,000
Unfortunately, Misaka
has a schedule to keep.

273
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,791
[MIKOTO] It's okay!

274
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,458
Come with me.

275
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,791
[KAMIJO] Well, every
family is different...

276
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,666
Some more than others...

277
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,791
[MISAKA 10031] Big Sister...
how far are we going to walk?

278
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,750
Misaka's schedule is already
off by thirty-eight seconds.

279
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,833
She must go soon.

280
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,666
The experiment...

281
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,125
The project was shut
down, wasn't it...?

282
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,458
So why...?

283
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,125
[MISAKA 10031] "To which
project are you referring?

284
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,166
Could you be inquiring about
Project Level 6 Shift...?

285
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,666
If so, it is proceeding
on schedule,"...

286
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,500
Misaka says to clarify.

287
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,250
But it's not...!

288
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,500
Still?

289
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,750
[MISAKA 10031] Mm. Yes...
That is correct...

290
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:12,166
Experiment Number 10020
was just conducted.

291
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,291
[MIKOTO] That's ten...

292
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,625
...thousand?

293
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,625
What is she saying...?

294
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,458
No... They can't...

295
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,708
I thought they went bankrupt!

296
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,083
I read it, but
I don't understand...!

297
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,333
How could they...?

298
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,041
It isn't over yet!

299
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,583
They're still...
killing those girls!

300
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,916
No... that's not true.

301
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,208
It was me... I killed them.

302
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,916
And her, too...

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,958
Soon, she'll be...

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,708
[MISAKA 10031] Big Sister?

305
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:56,708
Are you all--

306
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:01,375
[cat meows]

307
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,500
[MIKOTO] Aww! How adorable!

308
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,458
[MISAKA 10031] "Misaka
found the cute animal,"

309
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,250
says Misaka, trumpeting
her achievement.

310
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,708
[MIKOTO] What do I do now...?

311
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,250
What more...

312
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,416
can I possibly do?

313
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,375
[MISAKA 10031] Big Sister...

314
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,458
Big Sister, it's
a kitty-kiddy.

315
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:23,833
[MISAKAS] Big Sister...
Big Sister... Big Sister...

316
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,458
[MIKOTO] No, stop it!

317
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,416
Please, stop it!

318
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,041
I can't take it...

319
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,875
You showing up like this...

320
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,000
Looking like you do!
Just go away, all right?!

321
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,541
Okay.

322
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,041
Misaka will leave now.

323
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,833
[thud]

324
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,375
It keeps getting worse.

325
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,500
[KAMIJO] Man.

326
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,166
These are heavy...!

327
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,000
I wonder what was up with
Zapper and her sister...

328
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,750
That was strange.

329
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,875
Wha...!

330
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,666
Aww man, that's
gonna leave a bruise.

331
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,541
[MISAKA 10032]
"You've fallen.

332
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,041
Do you need a hand getting up?"

333
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,333
Misaka asks, offering her help,
somewhat reluctantly.

334
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,041
Thanks a lot, Zapper.

335
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,125
Oh, you aren't her.
You're the sister.

336
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,833
Wait... I thought
you guys wandered off

337
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,833
for a heart-to-heart
or something.

338
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,625
[MISAKA 10032] "Misaka was there
before, and now she is here,"

339
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,500
says Misaka, pointing.

340
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,000
"After we gather them,

341
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,958
where would you like to take
these canned beverages?"...

342
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,250
Asks Misaka,
cleaning up your mess.

343
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,333
Oh, uh, don't
worry about it!

344
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,958
Really, I can
carry them myself...

345
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,375
"After we have
picked them up,

346
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,375
where should we take
these beverages?"

347
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,291
Misaka asks,
repeating the question.

348
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,416
[door opens]

349
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,291
Hello.

350
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,000
Is something the matter...?

351
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,375
You look awfully
flushed, Dr. Amai...

352
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,541
Are you all right?

353
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,458
[AMAI] Don't "Hello" me...!

354
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,541
How could you involve
so many facilities?!

355
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,083
We're supposed to be taking
the lead on Level 6 Shift!

356
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,916
If you scatter the
work around like this,

357
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,083
the patent will never be--

358
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,500
[FOREIGNER 7-A] Now, now,
let's calm down.

359
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,250
We could divide it up
even more than this,

360
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,166
and there would still
be plenty of profit.

361
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,875
You can't possibly
know that!

362
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,041
Oh, but I can.

363
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,666
Listen...

364
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,791
Right now, what's most important
is completing the experiments.

365
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,250
A total of a hundred and
eighty-three facilities

366
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,125
are receiving transfers.

367
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,708
Quite a lot.

368
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,916
If that breaks our mysterious
attacker's sprit, then good...

369
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,333
And should the attacks
continue, well...

370
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,083
The more of those facilities
that are destroyed...

371
00:16:56,166 --> 00:17:00,083
the greater our share of the
profit becomes, doesn't it?

372
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,458
There're so many...

373
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,708
one-hundred-eighty-three...

374
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,416
[MIKOTO] How could it
have been spread between

375
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,416
that many facilities
in such a short time...?

376
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,083
How could one firm possibly
operate on this high a level?

377
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,875
[MIKOTO] Oh, wow...

378
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,416
I'm an idiot...

379
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I can't believe I
didn't see it sooner.

380
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,291
Academy City is under satellite
and camera surveillance

381
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,125
twenty-four hours a day...

382
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,791
There's no way that the city's
senior management could have

383
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,625
failed to notice these
twisted experiments

384
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:36,458
when they were being held
over and over again outside.

385
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,666
In other words...

386
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,958
All of Academy City...

387
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,791
...is my enemy.

388
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:54,250
[chewing sounds]

389
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,333
[ACCELERATOR] Ugh...

390
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,541
No flavor left in that piece.

391
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,375
[SUNGLASSES MAN 11-A]
Hello. Have a sec?

392
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,000
[ACCELERATOR] So, which
lab's errand boy are you?

393
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,000
What makes you think
I'm with a lab?

394
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,416
Only two types of people
ever come near me...

395
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,750
There are the ones who want to
use me for scientific analysis.

396
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,458
And then there are the
idiots who want to fight me

397
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:28,250
so they can claim the title
of Academy City's top dog.

398
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,041
Hmm... that's very interesting.

399
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,583
[ACCELERATOR] Though, as both
types tend to be full of crap,

400
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,625
I don't see all that much
difference between them.

401
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,208
It's called Level 6 Shift?

402
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,458
[SUNGLASSES MAN 11-A] Yeah...

403
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,583
An experiment with Tree
Diagram's endorsement.

404
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,791
[ACCELERATOR] Ha!
I'll pass, thanks.

405
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,666
I'm the first-ranked
esper in Academy City...

406
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,375
and that means I'm already
at the top of the heap, buddy.

407
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,041
No one can beat me...

408
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,000
No matter who they
are or what they try,

409
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,750
I'll win every single time.

410
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,458
So why should I
care about becoming

411
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,875
any stronger than I am now?

412
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,666
You're right
about one thing...

413
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,666
You are definitely the
strongest esper in the city.

414
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,083
However...

415
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,375
grand as it is, is that title
gonna be enough for you?

416
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,583
Doesn't it make life
a bit monotonous?

417
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,166
[SUNGLASSES MAN 11-A]
Just imagine...

418
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,250
If you were to gain
even greater power...

419
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,875
absolute power...

420
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,791
Then what would your
life be like...?

421
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,666
More interesting, I would think.

422
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,208
Even more power
than I already have...

423
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,833
Really?

424
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,333
[SUNGLASSES MAN 11-A]
I'm glad you decided to come.

425
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,833
[ACCELERATOR laughs]

426
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,208
[ACCELERATOR]
Mass-production of clones,

427
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,583
in violation of
international law.

428
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,208
I gotta admit,
I'm impressed.

429
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,833
You guys are a special
kind of crazy.

430
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,083
[SUNGLASSES MAN 11-A] Actually,
they were originally intended

431
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,375
for use in a completely
different project...

432
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,791
but things happen...

433
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,250
So all of them wound up
being handed over to us.

434
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,791
Now that you've seen them...

435
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,583
Are you still interested
in achieving Level 6?

436
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,708
[footsteps]

437
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,333
[ACCELERATOR]
Only another nine thousand

438
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,500
nine hundred and seventy
left to go, huh?

439
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,250
What a drag.

440
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,500
[door shuts]

441
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,666
[KUROKO] Okay, Sissy!

442
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,791
The bathtub is all
yours if you want it!

443
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,708
Alright, thank you.

444
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,916
[KUROKO] What happened?

445
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,666
She was in such good
spirits this afternoon.

446
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,708
[KUROKO gasps]

447
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,666
Don't tell me it
was that troglodyte!

448
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,666
[KUROKO demonically]
He shall pay for this!

449
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,958
[MIKOTO] What can I do?

450
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,416
Do I have any moves left...?

451
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,000
Find the mastermind and
put the screws to him...?

452
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,291
No. If Academy City

453
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,083
is green-lighting
these experiments,

454
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,958
that won't do any good...

455
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,208
who would come up with
such a messed-up project

456
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,958
in the first place...?

457
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,375
I get it.

458
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,083
That's why they aren't printing
anything about my attacks!

459
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,958
They don't want to risk
the public finding out

460
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,583
about their illegal
cloning experiments.

461
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:27,875
But... maybe...
if I were to destroy it...

462
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,875
Academy City would
have nowhere to turn.

463
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,625
If I did that...

464
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:37,041
My life could never
be normal again.

465
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,083
[MIKOTO chuckles]

466
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,791
What am I thinking...?

467
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,250
They've already killed
ten thousand of me,

468
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,916
and I'm worried about
living a normal life?

469
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,833
[MIKOTO] Hey... Kuroko...

470
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,333
Sissy...? Can I help
you with something?

471
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,333
Supposing--
just supposing...

472
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,666
I did something that
brought calamity and chaos

473
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,458
to Academy City...

474
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,625
What would you do?

475
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,875
Hmm...

476
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,500
If you mean making
off with drinks

477
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,208
from a vending machine
that you damaged,

478
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,291
I guess I would suggest
not doing it again...

479
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,458
That thing is fair game
as far as I'm concerned!

480
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,500
It stole money from me
my first year here!

481
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,791
No, I mean...

482
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,208
If I did something...

483
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:27,666
something that affected the
very core of Academy City...

484
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,333
[KUROKO] I cannot
pretend to know why

485
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,166
you would even ask a
question like that.

486
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,416
But if someone did something

487
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,208
to threaten the
safety of this city,

488
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,541
I wouldn't hesitate
to take action...

489
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:42,000
Even if that somebody
was you, Sissy.

490
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,041
[MIKOTO chuckles]

491
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,208
[MIKOTO] Then, despite
all the things you've said,

492
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,625
I suppose our relationship
really does have its limits.

493
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,083
[KUROKO]
No, it doesn't at all...!

494
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,458
Because in a million years,

495
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,333
I know there isn't
even a remote chance

496
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,041
that you would ever
do anything to--

497
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,000
[MIKOTO] Hah...! Gotcha!

498
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,250
I'm just messing with you.

499
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,916
That wasn't nice, Sissy!

500
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,500
[MIKOTO laughs]

501
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,375
[MIKOTO] Thank goodness.

502
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,833
Ooh... come a little
bit closer, Sissy...

503
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,250
[MIKOTO] If I put a
stop to the project

504
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,166
and Kuroko's the
one to catch me...

505
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,500
Well...

506
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,833
That wouldn't be so bad.

507
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,541
[SATEN] I knew it was a boy!

508
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,083
[KUROKO] Absolutely not!
One hundred percent not a boy!

509
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,750
--A boy!
--No it isn't!

510
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,291
--A boy! A boy!
--No it isn't!

511
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,458
--A boy! A boy!
--No it isn't! No it isn't!
