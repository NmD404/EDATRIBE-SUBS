1
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,333
Let's make a
trade, okay...?

2
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,958
My name is Ruiko.

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,333
Now it's your turn...

4
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,541
Do you think you can
tell me your name?

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,291
I'm Febri.

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,625
[GROUP] Aww...

7
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,583
[SATEN] That's a
very pretty name...!

8
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,916
Okay, then, Febri...

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,250
What else can you tell us...?

10
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,333
Anything goes. You can
just pick something.

11
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,875
[FEBRI] Mikoto Misaka.

12
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,166
[GROUP] Huh?

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,500
What, me?

14
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,083
So, um...

15
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,750
is this little one somebody you
might've actually met before?

16
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,375
No, not that
I can remember.

17
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,333
A distant relative
or something?

18
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,750
[KUROKO] Any half-sisters
you've never told us about?

19
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,458
Half-sisters?

20
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,791
[MIKOTO] Yeah, around
ten thousand or so...

21
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,875
[KUROKO] Wait...!
No, no, no, no, no...!

22
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,750
Do not tell me she's
your daughter...!

23
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,291
No, you would never
have done that!

24
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,375
Surely not without
telling me fir--

25
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,708
Ow... www...

26
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,708
Hi, I'm Mikoto Misaka...

27
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,833
I'm just wondering
how you know my name.

28
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,750
[KUROKO giggles]

29
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,000
They say children have a sixth
sense about things like this...

30
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,916
Which people are safe and
which ones are more dangerous.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,708
Uhh...

32
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:39,416
Heh. Maybe, but she
hasn't seen this yet!

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,875
[UIHARU] A finger puppet?

34
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,708
[KUROKO] A prize that
came with a soda...

35
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:46,291
I don't know how many cans she
drank before she finally got it.

36
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,000
[SATEN] Still into
that little guy, huh?

37
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,666
Ahh...

38
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,333
[MIKOTO high-pitched]
Yo...! My name is Gekota!

39
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,166
[laughs]

40
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,875
[MIKOTO high-pitched]
Your name's Febri, right?

41
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,291
Maybe you can tell
me something, Febri.

42
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,708
I would--

43
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,583
Ahh!

44
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,375
You only have a one
in twenty-four chance

45
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,375
of getting a pink Gekota!

46
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,708
Ugh...

47
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,375
Are you really going to
make a spectacle of yourself

48
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,875
over a lousy
finger puppet?

49
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,541
Hey, come on, now, Febri...

50
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,916
You can't just run off
with someone else's--

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,291
That is so cute.

52
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,000
[KUROKO] It's pretty obvious
who she trusts the most.

53
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,708
You know... that
Gekota isn't yours...

54
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,291
It belongs to Misaka...

55
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,250
Why don't we give it back?

56
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,666
No...! It's my Gekota!

57
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,958
[SATEN chuckles]

58
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,166
Well, I tried.

59
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,708
[KUROKO sighs]

60
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,583
[KONORI] Hm. I'm not finding
any information on her

61
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,208
under lost children
or missing persons.

62
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,916
[UIHARU] Nothing at all, huh?

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,958
[KONORI] It's too late for me
to get in touch with somebody

64
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,500
at Antiskill who could help us.

65
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,708
What are we
supposed to do?

66
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,791
[SATEN] Well...

67
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,750
how about I take
her for the night...?

68
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,250
I mean, just look at her...

69
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,583
I have a little brother,

70
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,541
so taking care of children
is nothing new for me.

71
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,583
[KONORI] Well,
I hate to impose...

72
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,500
but if you really
wouldn't mind...

73
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,416
I don't mind at all!

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,916
But, you know...

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,666
my place is a bit small...

76
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,708
and it probably wouldn't
hurt to have some help...

77
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,375
What do you say Uiharu?
Wanna give me a hand?

78
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,708
Yes!

79
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,583
[light laughter]

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,416
[UIHARU] Hmm.

81
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,625
[SATEN] How's it
going out there...?

82
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,875
Ready?

83
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,291
Yeah!

84
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,041
[FEBRI sighs]

85
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,208
Lolly...

86
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,458
What's a lolly?

87
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,708
Here... it's all yours!

88
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,458
Should we see if she
wants to eat something?

89
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,166
Hey... want some supper?

90
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,125
[stomach growls]

91
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,875
[UIHARU and SATEN laugh]

92
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,625
Boing, boing, boing,
boing, boing, boing, boing!

93
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:57,208
Boing, boing, boing!
Boing, boing, boing.

94
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,583
So, looks like it's
time to play house...

95
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,708
Are you up for it?

96
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,416
Totally!

97
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,666
It's time to dig in!

98
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,208
[FEBRI sniffs]

99
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,958
What's the matter?
Doesn't it look tasty?

100
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,291
Aaahhh...

101
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,291
Aaaaahhhh...

102
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,041
Good, huh?

103
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,375
Yeah! Heh!

104
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,500
[UIHARU and SATEN laugh]

105
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,875
[SATEN] Okay... here we go.

106
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,500
Close your eyes for me!

107
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,500
Whee!

108
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,375
[SATEN] Okay, now
it's your turn...

109
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,375
Will you spray some water on me?

110
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,541
[FEBRI] Yeah!

111
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,541
[SATEN] Whoa...!
Easy, now, or you'll fall!

112
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,625
Be careful, Feb--

113
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,666
[splash]

114
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,583
[FEBRI] Ooh...
Are you okay, Ruiko?

115
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,041
[SATEN] Ooh...! You did
that on purpose...!

116
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,541
I'm gonna get you!

117
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,458
[water splashes]
[SATEN and FEBRI laugh]

118
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,125
[SATEN] Hey...!
Aren't you coming in?

119
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,333
Uiharu!

120
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,666
Hey, Whee-hah!

121
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,541
Yeah! Heh.

122
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,958
[zipper unzips]

123
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,250
[MIKOTO sighs]

124
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,916
I hate to say it,
but you seem to be

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,250
a finger short of a froggy.

126
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,125
Hey, don't worry.
I'm okay...

127
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,791
One lousy
finger puppet...

128
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,666
A free prize with
a can of soda...

129
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,791
It's...
no big deal...

130
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:42,291
Well, it sure doesn't
sound like you're okay.

131
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,375
I just have a lot of
things on my mind...

132
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,833
You know, like...

133
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,791
How does a little girl
I've never met before

134
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,166
know my name...?

135
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,500
And, more importantly,
why is she so afraid of me?

136
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,791
What...?!

137
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,958
Please don't tell me
that little street urchin

138
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,541
hurt your feelings, Sissy!

139
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,250
Absolutely unforgiveable!

140
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,125
But you need not despair...!

141
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,125
I know exactly how to fill
the hole that wayward child

142
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,333
has left in your heart!

143
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,583
Huh? Ah!

144
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,291
[KUROKO yells]

145
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,708
[HEAD RESIDENT] Hey, Shirai...!

146
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,791
What's all the commotion?!

147
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,708
[MIKOTO] I really wonder...

148
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,291
How in the world does that
lost little girl know my name?

149
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:38,791
[UIHARU] So, um...

150
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,125
She's pretty unusual, huh?

151
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,708
[SATEN] Still a cutie, though.

152
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,375
Yeah.

153
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,375
Hmm...

154
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,750
My goodness...!
That's an intense flavor.

155
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,750
Yeah...! It's crazy, huh?

156
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,708
[MIKOTO groans]

157
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,416
And she just sucks on
them like they're nothing.

158
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,875
[UIHARU] Oh, you're terrible,
Saten, you know that?

159
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,875
She did the same thing
to me last night.

160
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,875
"Hey, this is delicious,
you should really try it!"

161
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,875
Oh, let it go.
I said I was sorry.

162
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,875
Having fun?

163
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,041
Yeah!

164
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,208
Good to hear.

165
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,250
Yeah, I'm glad you're
having fun, Febri!

166
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,250
Heh, heh.

167
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,791
Ugh...

168
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,250
[UIHARU] Still no luck.

169
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,250
There's no data on her anywhere.

170
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,166
I put her information into the
database that handles queries

171
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,875
from missing persons
and lost child cases...

172
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,125
but so far, there's
been no response.

173
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,291
We all know what
that means, right?

174
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,375
Little Febri here
might be a Child Error.

175
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,458
Oh, yeah.

176
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,250
[door opens]

177
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,125
[HARU'UE] Hi everyone!

178
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,833
[UIHARU] Hey, Haru'ue!

179
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,416
We're settled from the move...

180
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,125
So I thought I would stop by
here and say hello to you all.

181
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,666
[KOSAKO] Well, what d'you know.

182
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,541
So that's where she ran off to.

183
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,875
[typing]

184
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,500
Ah, excellent.

185
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,708
You managed
to find her.

186
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,750
[HARU'UE] A Child Error.
That's what you think she is?

187
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,458
It does seem likely...

188
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,166
I've tried everything,
but I haven't found

189
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,625
any other information on her.

190
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,208
Guess we'll have to
wait until someone

191
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,458
from an institution
can come to get her.

192
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,125
I hope she gets
into a good one.

193
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,250
There are good homes
and bad homes?

194
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,833
From what I've heard, things
can get pretty horrible,

195
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,500
depending on the
facility you're in.

196
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,500
Well, maybe... we can
choose where she goes...

197
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,833
Hey, Uiharu...

198
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,125
do you know of any sites
that rate and review

199
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,625
these types of institutions?

200
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,833
No, they don't
really do that.

201
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,458
Hey...! I know!

202
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,000
I've received
confirmation.

203
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,500
They're willing
to accept her.

204
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,916
Asunaro Park said okay!

205
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,916
It's a facility
in District 13.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,541
Don't worry, we've
been there before.

207
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,666
We know first-hand that
it's a warm, welcoming place.

208
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,791
However, there's
one small problem...

209
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,291
They aren't ready to
take her in quite yet...

210
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,875
They'll need at least five days.

211
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,541
That shouldn't
be a big issue...

212
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,625
I am more than happy to
look after her 'til then.

213
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,333
I'll help take
care of her, too.

214
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,208
Yeah, so will I.

215
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,666
In that case, I shall assist
with childcare, as well.

216
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,875
[HEAD RESIDENT]
All right, then...

217
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,375
I'll inform them
of our decision.

218
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,416
So... little one...

219
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,583
would you mind sticking with us
for just a little bit longer?

220
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,833
With you, Ruiko?

221
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,125
Yeah...! And
everyone else, too!

222
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,541
[FEBRI] You mean, with Whee-hah?

223
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,708
Yep.

224
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,916
[FEBRI] And Kuroko?

225
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,166
Yes.

226
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,708
[MIKOTO chuckles]

227
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,625
[FEBRI] And Mii?

228
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,625
Of course. I'll be here, too!

229
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,250
[FEBRI giggles]

230
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,875
[MIKOTO groans]

231
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,500
[UIHARU] Five days, huh?

232
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,333
That means Febri's
going to be with us

233
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,666
until the day of
the Reach Assembly.

234
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,583
Oh yeah...!
Speaking of which...

235
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,208
it's just about time for
our on-site security meeting,

236
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,791
isn't it?

237
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,458
[KONORI] I really do hope that
you'll come and visit us again.

238
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,666
[HARU'UE] Of course I will...

239
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,916
Next time I'll bring
Banri with me, too...

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,125
Bye-bye now, Febri,
you be good, okay?

241
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,083
Okay bye, Erii!

242
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,166
[MIKOTO]
Huh...?!

243
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,916
Even Haru'ue?!

244
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,625
[FEBRI giggles]

245
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,000
[MIKOTO] So help me...!

246
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,541
I swear I will get that girl
to call me by my name!

247
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,833
[SATEN] Huh.

248
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,958
Is this really where they're
holding the Reach Assembly?

249
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,583
'Cause that's
kinda surprising...

250
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,666
[KUROKO] Yes...

251
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,208
Well, it's one of
the sites, anyway.

252
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,125
It's just that this
place is sort of--

253
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,458
how do I put it?--
sad and uninviting.

254
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,208
[KONORI] The focus of the Reach
Assembly is academic rigor,

255
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,416
prioritizing pure research
over esper abilities...

256
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,666
The result is an understandable
lack of glitz and glamour.

257
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,791
[UIHARU] It tends to
get pretty nerdy.

258
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,041
[SATEN] That makes sense.

259
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,625
You sound like you're really
disappointed about this...

260
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,416
What were you expecting
the assembly to be like?

261
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,041
Oh, well, you know...

262
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,500
something with street stalls
and lots of events...

263
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,291
Everyone working together
to get it all set up...

264
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,291
That sort of thing.

265
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,916
Okay, so that's
why you came along.

266
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,375
Yeah, that's
pretty much it...

267
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,208
I thought it would
keep Febri, you know...

268
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,291
amused... Right?

269
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,291
Right?

270
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,375
[UIHARU] Right.

271
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,208
[MIKOTO] So cute!

272
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,500
[KONGO] My...!
Look who we ran into...!

273
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,041
Isn't that Misaka?

274
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:42,833
[MIKOTO] Huh?

275
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,375
Yep, that's her,
all right.

276
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,833
What a strange
coincidence.

277
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,583
Oh, hey...
it's Kongo.

278
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,416
I can see that,
thank you...

279
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,791
What is she
doing here?

280
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,208
Well hello there...
It's nice to meet you...

281
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:53,750
My name is...

282
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,000
[MIKOTO] I see.

283
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,041
So Wannai, somebody you
know from the swim club

284
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,791
is presenting at
the Reach Assembly ?

285
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,041
Yes...

286
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,750
We're here to help her
set up her presentation.

287
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,208
Awatsuki and I volunteered
to lend her a hand

288
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,916
since we're friends with her...

289
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,833
Kongo doesn't know her but
selflessly came along, anyway.

290
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,875
It's nothing to fuss
about, I assure you...

291
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,250
We'll be set up in
a matter of moments...

292
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,291
I'm always happy to
help those in need.

293
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,250
[laughs]

294
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,666
[MIKOTO chuckles]

295
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,333
[KONGO] So, tell me, Misaka,

296
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,333
is this young lady
tagging along with you

297
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,916
somebody's little sister?

298
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,166
[MIKOTO] Oh, no...

299
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,333
It's kind of a long story.

300
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,583
Come here you two...

301
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,666
You need to meet this
darling little girl...

302
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,541
Her name's Febri.
Isn't that pretty...?

303
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,000
We've only just met...

304
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,958
but I can already tell that
we're going to be friends.

305
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,500
[gasps]

306
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,916
In that case,
I know that we are

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,208
going to be the best of
friends, as well, Febri...!

308
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,416
My name is Mitsuko Kongo...

309
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,333
It is such a pleasure
to meet you... Truly!

310
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,083
It's really nice to
meet you, too, Mitsuko.

311
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,875
[KONGO] Yet another friend...!

312
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,375
My list keeps growing!

313
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,250
[MIKOTO] Great...
Now Kongo, too?

314
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,833
[AWATSUKI] Nice to see everyone!

315
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,416
[WANNAI] Have a great day!

316
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,833
[FEBRI] Bye-bye!

317
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:04,875
[UIHARU] Okay, you guys...

318
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,583
We're headed off
to our meeting now.

319
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,708
All right,
sounds good.

320
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,875
We'll just have a
look around the area.

321
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,875
[MIKOTO] This should give
me the chance I need.

322
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,250
[KONORI] Let's see...

323
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,291
Just give me a minute...

324
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,458
I think it was...

325
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,875
This place is ridiculously
spread out, huh?

326
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,583
Hey, before you go...
tell me where the bathroom is.

327
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,208
Well, it's...

328
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,958
how about I just take you there?

329
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,125
Yeah, if you don't mind.

330
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,750
Ruiko...?

331
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,708
[SATEN] It's all right, sweetie.

332
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,250
I'll be back in a
minute. Until then...

333
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,416
Why don't you wait
with Big Sister Mikoto?

334
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,291
I'm giving you two
a little time...

335
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,000
Have fun, okay?

336
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,791
[SATEN giggles]

337
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,833
[MIKOTO laughs]

338
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,166
Wait right there...!
I'll be back!

339
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,458
Don't be gone long!

340
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,541
[YOMIKAWA] Of all the...

341
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,166
This campus is a big,
sprawling mess...

342
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,458
We're gonna need a few
more security personnel.

343
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,083
[DRIVER 19-A] No...
I'm totally sure.

344
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,000
This is where it's
supposed to be delivered.

345
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,708
[MALE JUDGMENT OFFICER 19-A]
On paper, that may be true.

346
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,958
However...

347
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,208
we simply don't have the
authority to receive it.

348
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,208
Is there some kind
of problem here?

349
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,958
Apparently, this is a
delivery for the assembly.

350
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,083
But the student who is
supposed to sign for it

351
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,708
hasn't arrived yet.

352
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,583
This school is one of the
regular assembly prize winners.

353
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,125
Yes, you're
right. It is...

354
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,583
Most of the
other regulars

355
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,166
haven't shown up
this year, either.

356
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,958
Not here or at the other sites.
It's really kinda' strange.

357
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,208
[YOMIKAWA] Hmm...

358
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,541
Hey...

359
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,875
What's the matter now?

360
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,041
It's just...

361
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,208
Maybe I'm wrong, but
I thought I saw somebody

362
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,208
from one of the schools
we were talking about.

363
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,666
Huh?

364
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,375
[ARITOMI] I have
arrived at the site.

365
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,708
The package appears to have
been safely delivered, as well.

366
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:51,750
[KOSAKO] Roger that.

367
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,125
That's all for now.

368
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,375
I'll contact you again once
I've located the target.

369
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,041
[MIKOTO] So, Febri...

370
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,416
you getting hungry at all?

371
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,875
[FEBRI] Uh-uh.

372
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,750
Okay, then. Thirsty, maybe?

373
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,000
[FEBRI] Uh-uh.

374
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,750
Hey, look over
there, Febri...!

375
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,875
Those flowers are
beautiful, aren't they?

376
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,000
Why's Ruiko
taking so long?

377
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,208
[MIKOTO] She's one
tough customer...

378
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,125
and here I always thought
I had a way with kids.

379
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,625
[MIKOTO] Mm-mm...

380
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,541
I am not going to let
this discourage me...

381
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm ready to make a
sacrifice if necessary...

382
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,291
It's time to call
in the super-rare,

383
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:33,333
one in every sixty cans...
rainbow Gekota!

384
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,708
All right,
check this out!

385
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,666
[MIKOTO] Oh, no!

386
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,625
Where is she?!

387
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,916
Ahh!

388
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,291
Aw, man.

389
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,541
Who knew having a job was
so freaking exhausting?

390
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,250
[gasps]

391
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,458
Wow...!

392
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,916
Well, aren't you just
the cutest little thing?

393
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,791
Or not...

394
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,791
[FEBRI] Gekota...

395
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,458
[MIKOTO] I'm sorry!

396
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,708
I just took my eyes
off her for a second!

397
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,791
[SATEN] It'll be all right.

398
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,375
She couldn't have
gotten very far...

399
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,458
I'll start looking for her, too.

400
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,458
[MIKOTO] Great, thanks!

401
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,458
Hey, Febriiii!

402
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,708
[KONGO] Is something wrong?

403
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,125
Where are you...? Whee-hah...

404
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,375
Kuroko...

405
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,291
Mii...

406
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,708
Ruiko!

407
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,333
[FEBRI sobs]

408
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,166
This is it.
Target located.

409
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,250
[KONGO] There she is!

410
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,416
[FEBRI] Erii...

411
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,916
Mitsuko...

412
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,500
[MIKOTO] Febri!

413
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,583
[sighs]

414
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:33,458
[alarm sounds]

415
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,625
Ah!

416
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,291
Ahhhhh... Ah!

417
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,500
That looked like...

418
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,708
[MIKOTO sighs]

419
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,916
Good, you're okay!

420
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:12,375
[FEBRI cries]

421
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,375
Uh?

422
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,125
Ruiko!

423
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,500
[MIKOTO] Heh.

424
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,125
Oh, well...

425
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,541
I'm just glad she's safe.

426
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,541
No doubt about it...

427
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,916
That's her.

428
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,458
[KUROKO] So, it has been
quite an eventful day.

429
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,208
[UIHARU] I'm so glad that
nothing bad happened to her.

430
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,041
[MIKOTO] It was my fault for not
watching her more carefully.

431
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,333
I'm really, really sorry, Saten.

432
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,291
[SATEN] I should apologize, too.

433
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,666
Please forgive me.

434
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
Uh... for what?

435
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,333
Come on, now, Febri...

436
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,833
You made Big Sister Mikoto very
worried, running off like that.

437
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,083
You should say sorry, too.

438
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,916
It's okay.

439
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,416
I'm really sorry.

440
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,791
[gasps]

441
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,166
[MIKOTO] Hmm?

442
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,250
Thank you, Mikoto...!

443
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,583
Bye-bye now!

444
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,041
Ah!

445
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,791
[chuckles]

446
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,541
Hey, you...! Get back here!

447
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,083
[FEBRI] Ha, ha! No-oo!

448
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,000
[MIKOTO] I'm gonna get you!

449
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,750
I knew they'd be
friends eventually.

450
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,750
They just needed a little
while, that's all.

451
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,583
I am glad to see them
enjoying themselves.

452
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,875
Seeing them together like
that really does make it

453
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,791
worth all the trouble
I had to go through.

454
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,083
[KUROKO] Honestly, Kongo...!

455
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,791
You're going to
take all the credit?

456
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,458
That isn't very graceful of you.

457
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,666
Downright petty, in fact.

458
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,875
But I really was helpful
this time, I swear!

459
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,125
You just didn't see, that's all.

460
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,375
[KUROKO] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,541
[KONGO] I'm telling you,
it's the complete truth!

462
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,875
[KUROKO] Of course it is.
I believe you.

463
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,916
[KONGO] Don't say it like that.
I'm being serious!

464
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,666
[ARITOMI] As you know,
there are only seven

465
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,166
Level 5s here in Academy City...

466
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,041
and now, in addition
to the fourth-ranked,

467
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,791
we'll be able to experiment
on the third-ranked, as well...

468
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,958
This is truly a
stroke of good luck.

469
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,916
Well, in that case, I move
we put it to a vote.

470
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,500
Let's see a show of hands...

471
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:11,083
Those in favor of conducting
the experiment on Railgun?

472
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,750
[ARITOMI] And, of course,
I am in favor, as well.

473
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,041
[ARITOMI laughs]

474
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,083
[FEBRI muffled] So, next time,
Ruiko and Whee-hah

475
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,166
and Kuroko and Mikoto and--

476
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,666
[MIKOTO] Who thought letting her
do the preview was a good idea?

477
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,541
She's still got a
lollipop in her mouth!
