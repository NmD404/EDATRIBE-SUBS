00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,041
[HEAD RESIDENT] An after-hours
pass request? Really?

2
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,666
Um. Yes!

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,041
[HEAD RESIDENT] After making
such a pathetic excuse

4
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,791
for being out all those
nights without permission,

5
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,416
you ask for this?

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,916
You've got some
nerve, don't you?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,875
All of the necessary paperwork
does seem to be accounted for.

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,333
[MIKOTO laughs]

9
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,750
[HEAD RESIDENT] As it happens,

10
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,000
I received a virtually
identical request from Shirai.

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,333
It was dated tomorrow, and had
the same reason for absence

12
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,041
"a study group with friends."

13
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,291
Oh, yes.
Kuroko and I are both--

14
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,791
What are you
two scheming?

15
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,166
Nothing, I swear!

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,291
We're just studying
with some friends.

17
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,083
[HEAD RESIDENT] Hm.
Can't you study in the dorm?

18
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,583
Why do you need to
leave the premises?

19
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,250
I guess you could say,
for a change of pace?

20
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,041
These friends are
from another school,

21
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,500
and we're all really loaded up
with summer vacation homework.

22
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,166
You know?

23
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,833
[HEAD RESIDENT]
Very well. You may go.

24
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,458
[MIKOTO] Huh?

25
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,708
I hope your study
group is productive.

26
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:22,666
However, if you are even one
minute past your return time,

27
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,583
you know what is
going to happen.

28
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:26,958
Don't you?

29
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,041
[MIKOTO] Uh... yeah!

30
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,958
[SATEN hums]

31
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,625
[phone rings]

32
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,708
A good day to
you Uiharu!

33
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,958
What's happening?

34
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,375
[UIHARU] I've got good news!

35
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,541
Misaka and Shirai both got
their after-hours passes!

36
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,583
[SATEN] Oh, really?

37
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,416
That's fantastic!

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,958
They said getting approved
might be kind of tricky.

39
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,583
But, I'm glad it worked out.

40
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,291
[UIHARU] So that means
we can proceed

41
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,625
with today's study
group as scheduled!

42
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,916
It's been so long since
we've all been together!

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,458
[SATEN] Mm-Hm. Heh!

44
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,750
And Misaka will be there, so
it's the perfect opportunity

45
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,291
to find out who she
made those cookies for!

46
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,791
Behave yourself, Saten.

47
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,333
We aren't entirely sure
she gave them to a boy.

48
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, I'm completely sure!

49
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:46,791
There was a look on Miska's face
that I've never seen before.

50
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,166
There we have it.
All ready!

51
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,083
And now we put
them in the oven.

52
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,583
And then we just have to wait
a little while for them to bake.

53
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,250
I hope I'm not
putting you out.

54
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,458
It's really great of you to
let me use your kitchen today.

55
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,166
No, it's not a
problem at all!

56
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,958
Though for something
like baking cookies.

57
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,166
I would think your dorm
would be better equipped

58
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,875
than my lame kitchen.

59
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,666
Oh, um, not really.

60
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,083
When it comes to prying eyes, my
dorm has more than its share.

61
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,291
You know?

62
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,583
[MIKOTO] Mainly Kuroko,
Kuroko, and Kuroko.

63
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,166
Ho-ho.

64
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,291
So this present you're
preparing is for someone

65
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,125
you don't want other people
asking you about, huh?

66
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,750
No, that's not it!

67
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,083
I'm in this person's debt,

68
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,500
and I don't like being
indebted to anybody.

69
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,916
I would have
thought store-bought

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,333
would be good enough,
personally, but the idiot said

71
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,250
something about how cookies
are best if homemade.

72
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,791
I'm not doing this
'cause I feel obligated.

73
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,333
I'm just tired of listening
to all the whining,

74
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,750
and I thought this
way it would stop.

75
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,916
Well, then. Good for you.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,333
Uiharu and I have been concerned
about you for a while, Misaka.

77
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,708
And you know poor
Shirai's been distraught.

78
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,250
[MIKOTO] Ehh...

79
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,416
I understand if I'm not the
person you want to confide in,

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,916
but I hope you know I'm
always here if you need me.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,291
[MIKOTO] I'm sorry. It's just...

82
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,083
I'm the one who caused the
problem in the first place.

83
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,625
I didn't want to drag
anybody else into it.

84
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,958
Looking back on it now.

85
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,083
It was almost more
than I could handle.

86
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,458
I'll try to be more careful.

87
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,583
I'm really sorry.

88
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,083
Great.

89
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,750
Anyway, you seem to be
feeling a lot better now.

90
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,583
Having a new boyfriend
can do that, huh?

91
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,833
Boy? Uh n-no.
I don't have a boyf--

92
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,833
Ah! Oh, no, the flour!
Whoa, and the eggs, too!

93
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,375
[SATEN] How adorable.

94
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,958
She sure made a mess,
though. Heh, heh.

95
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,958
[UIHARU] It wouldn't be
very nice to try to force

96
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,458
the information
out of her, Saten.

97
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,208
Yeah, yeah. I know that.

98
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,375
[UIHARU] Once we're finished up
with our Judgment work,

99
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,958
Shirai and I will do our
shopping and head over.

100
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:51,000
As for Haru'ue, she says
she has something to do,

101
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,333
so she'll be a little late.

102
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,250
All right. I'll get
things ready here.

103
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,000
That sounds good.
I'll see you later.

104
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,125
[UIHARU gasps]

105
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,000
[UIHARU] Hey Shirai!

106
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,500
How has your morning been?

107
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,291
[KUROKO] Good so far.

108
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,166
[MAIKA] Lots of free time on
your hands again, huh, Misaka?

109
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,375
[MIKOTO] Just a minute,
when you say it like that,

110
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,208
you make it sound
like I'm a loser.

111
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,625
I'm just taking it easy now

112
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,666
because I have plans
later in the day.

113
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,750
[MAIKA] You've been skipping
meals in the dorm a lot lately.

114
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,250
What have you been up to?

115
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,791
You know, a little of
this, a little of that.

116
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,958
[MAIKA] A lot of the time,

117
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,791
Shirai came here and
just ate by herself.

118
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,958
[MIKOTO] I know.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,875
[crashing sound]

120
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:53,125
[ALLEY CATS growl and hiss]

121
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,458
[KUROKO] Hm.

122
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,000
It sure is peaceful now.

123
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,250
That whole Money Card situation
seems to have settled down

124
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,791
and the back streets and
alleys of Academy City

125
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,666
have finally returned
to their usual calm.

126
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,708
[GIRL 17-A] Cute!
Where did you buy that?

127
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,250
[GIRL 17-B] I can show
you the store now.

128
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,458
[GIRL 17-A] Really?
That would be great!

129
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,208
[SAILOR SHIRT GIRL 7-A]
I found one!

130
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,916
[GREEN SHIRT GIRL 7-A]
Whoa! Another?

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,791
[MINORI] See? Isn't
this place amazing?

132
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,875
Not for me.

133
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,375
I've only found
three-leaf ones.

134
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,000
[MINORI] Judgment lady!

135
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,458
How are you doing?

136
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,083
Long time no see.

137
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,500
Here, take a look!

138
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,500
When I told my friends
about the clovers,

139
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,125
they all wanted one,
so I brought them here.

140
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,583
That was nice of you.

141
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,333
I don't want you guys staying
out here too late, though.

142
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,500
[MINORI] Mm.

143
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,083
[SAILOR SHIRT GIRL 7-A]
Found another one!

144
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,083
I finally found one!
It's got five leaves!

145
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,666
[MINORI] Let me see! Let me see!

146
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,291
[SAILOR SHIRT GIRL 7-A] Look!

147
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,291
[MINORI] Oh!

148
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,708
Yep. Things are
nice and peaceful.

149
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,416
[UIHARU sighs]

150
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,416
[UIHARU groans]

151
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,458
Tough homework?

152
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,666
[UIHARU] Yeah.

153
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,708
There was this book
report I was assigned,

154
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,583
but I'm not sure what
I want to write it on.

155
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,041
There's not much time
until the vacation's over.

156
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,666
I know, don't remind me.

157
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,416
There are still so many
loose ends to wrap up, too.

158
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
[alarm sounds]

159
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,666
Ah, not again.

160
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,250
[KONORI] What's up?

161
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,875
[UIHARU] Someone is trying to
crack into the newspaper club's

162
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,833
server at Sakugawa
Middle School.

163
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,583
I was asked to look out for it.

164
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,375
We have a hacker.

165
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,708
This seems to be
happening a lot lately.

166
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,208
Why would they even
want to go after

167
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,541
a middle school
newspaper, anyway?

168
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,875
You know how
hackers are.

169
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,500
They're always
after a challenge,

170
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,916
and you are one of the best
goalies in the whole city.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,833
[UIHARU] Huh? Did
you say something?

172
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,208
[KONORI chuckles]

173
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,208
[UIHARU] Ah, they broke
through the firewall again.

174
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,083
That's pretty impressive.

175
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,208
You're almost in now.
Keep trying!

176
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,208
Uh, "keep trying"?
You're rooting for them?

177
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,375
No, it's okay.

178
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,041
The server itself
is actually a trap.

179
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,166
I just have to log
the hacker's IP address

180
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,458
and send it on to Antiskill.

181
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,791
[UIHARU] Ugh.

182
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,750
Maybe I should try to find
a different book to read.

183
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,750
But I'll probably just have a
hard time with that one, too.

184
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,625
The legendary digital
goalie of Academy City.

185
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,458
Brought low by a book report.

186
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,458
What was that?

187
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,166
You say something
about a goalie?

188
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,708
[KONORI] Never mind. There
anything I can do to help?

189
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,833
It's so sweet of you to ask!

190
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,291
Oh, well, this isn't
about the book report.

191
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,125
But maybe you could help me out.

192
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,208
Do you happen to know of
a supermarket around here

193
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,541
with a good selection?

194
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,083
Supermarket?
What for?

195
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,541
[UIHARU] I'm going to
a study group after this.

196
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,416
We're each supposed to pick up
an ingredient at the store,

197
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,791
then we're meeting
at Saten's place.

198
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,166
[SATEN] There we go.

199
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,416
[KUROKO] Hm...

200
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,083
[KONGO] Oh, would
you look at that!

201
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,333
[KUROKO] Uhh...

202
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,041
[KONGO] Hello, Shirai.

203
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,000
Such a small world, isn't it?

204
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,750
Lovely. It's Kongo.

205
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,500
Doing some shopping?

206
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,291
Yes, I am.

207
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,166
So, what are you
in the market for?

208
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,791
Just getting some
food, that's all.

209
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,166
What a coincidence!

210
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,666
That's what
I'm doing, too.

211
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,916
I could accompany you.

212
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,666
I don't mind. It isn't
too much out of my way.

213
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,625
Oh, but I would hate
to inconvenience you

214
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,916
in the slightest.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,708
I'm sure you have a
very busy day of snobbery

216
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,916
and condescension planned.

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,458
I felt it was my civic
duty to approach you.

218
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,083
You just looked so
lonely out here,

219
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,208
shopping without a single
friend by your side.

220
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,625
Interesting you
should say that,

221
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,375
considering that you
appear to be shopping

222
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,708
all by yourself,
as well.

223
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,791
[KONGO gasps]

224
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,541
I am doing no such
thing, thank you.

225
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,083
In fact, I'm going to meet up
with Wannai and Awatsuki

226
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,125
in a little while.

227
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,833
I mean, we don't
have plans, exactly.

228
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,541
But they'll be done with
swim practice shortly.

229
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,625
Until then, I'm just
passing the time

230
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,208
with some personal shopping.

231
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,750
Would it help if I clarified the
definition of "alone" for you?

232
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,708
Now, just come with me.

233
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,458
There is a fantastic
shop over here

234
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,625
that is one of my favorites.

235
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,958
[KUROKO] Huh? Hey!

236
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,583
[dog barks]

237
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,916
Why are we in
a pet store?

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,500
[KONGO] Yes!

239
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,333
The selection here is every bit
as good as I've come to expect!

240
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,000
Hey, um, Kongo.

241
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,166
Oh these are
nice and plump.

242
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,333
They should be
the perfect size.

243
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,375
I'm confused, here.

244
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,458
Would you mind holding
these for a sec?

245
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,916
[KUROKO] Uh-- Ahhh!

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,541
I thought you said you were
out shopping for food today!

247
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,333
Ecaterina will be happy.

248
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,416
She has a very sophisticated
palate, you know.

249
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,833
And this "Ecaterina,"
would be...

250
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,208
...that giant python?

251
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,458
[KUROKO screams]

252
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,958
Turtle?

253
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,083
[KITTY meows]

254
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,166
[MIKOTO] Heh.

255
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,083
[FROG DOCTOR] Ah.

256
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,750
I'm guessing you're
here about the girls?

257
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,375
[MIKOTO] Yes.

258
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,875
[FROG DOCTOR] I'm sure
you'll be happy to hear

259
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,125
that they're all
doing very well.

260
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,500
That also includes
the one who was injured.

261
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,791
She seems to be
making good progress.

262
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,833
On the surface, anyhow.

263
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,500
[MIKOTO] What does that mean?

264
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,458
Following my
initial examination,

265
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,166
I have learned a few things.

266
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,125
As we suspected,
they are clones,

267
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,708
created from the somatic
cells of the Original.

268
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,291
Which is you, of course.

269
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,875
During the creation process,

270
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,208
various drugs were administered
to the culture fluid.

271
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,166
These drugs promoted the
rapid growth of their bodies.

272
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,958
They developed incredibly
quickly from fertilized eggs

273
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,791
to their current form
in a mere fourteen days.

274
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,833
The girls already have shorter
lifespans than ordinary people,

275
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,666
but the accelerated
growth process

276
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,916
has shortened them even further.

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,458
[MIKOTO] Ah!
Shortened? How much?

278
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,541
Hm. I can't really give
you an exact timeline,

279
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:52,875
but I would guess that, at most,
they have another year or two.

280
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,458
Oh, no.

281
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,958
[FROG DOCTOR] Which is why
they need to be adjusted.

282
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,875
Adjusted?

283
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,541
[FROG DOCTOR] Here,
take a look at this.

284
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,750
What we'll do is balance
the hormones that promote

285
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,250
rapid growth and regulate
the rate of division

286
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,666
of the cell nuclei.

287
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,833
By doing so, we should
be able to recover

288
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,791
a certain degree of
their lifespans.

289
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,375
We can't cut so many
young lives short, can we?

290
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,125
We're currently in the process
of dividing this research

291
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,666
among organizations
outside of the city.

292
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,250
There will be
constant communication

293
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,666
between these facilities,

294
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,166
ensuring that everything that
can be done for them is.

295
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,208
Outside facilities?
That sounds perfect.

296
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,625
[FROG DOCTOR] The fight for
those girls will continue.

297
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,625
And it may be a long road yet.

298
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,958
Although, at least this time
it won't be a fight to die,

299
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,875
but rather a fight to live.

300
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,958
Hmm. I just don't know.

301
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,208
I wonder what everybody
else is going to bring.

302
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,000
[KUROKO hums]

303
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,250
I'm so excited!

304
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,291
I've found the ultimate
ingredient for tonight.

305
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,041
Sparkling clean.

306
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,791
[MIKOTO] Oh, man.
I'm running late!

307
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,125
Kuroko's probably
there by now.

308
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,166
[WAITRESS 17-A] Table for one?

309
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,791
[MIKOTO] No.
I'm meeting someone.

310
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,041
[FRENDA] Huh?

311
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,000
[MIKOTO] Uhh--

312
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,833
I'll be right back with
some water and a menu.

313
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,750
[MIKOTO] Oh, no! Please don't!

314
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,291
I'm not with them.

315
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,500
I knew there was something I
didn't like about this place.

316
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,250
Apparently they
cater to spoiled,

317
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,916
sheltered
little princesses.

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,458
[thud]

319
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,708
You know, that fight was far
from a clear victory for you.

320
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,208
Huh?

321
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,708
[FRENDA] To be fair, it's an
issue of prior information.

322
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,375
If I had known you
were the Railgun,

323
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,000
I would have taken more care
setting up my stuffed doll-

324
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,041
Frenda!

325
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,500
[FRENDA] Huh?

326
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,166
You haven't forgotten that
it was because you neglected

327
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,958
to clean up those
very same dolls

328
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,333
that she was able to
get away, have you?

329
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:05,541
Ah! Oh yeah, I guess
that's right, huh?

330
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,500
[FRENDA] Owwww!

331
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,208
Clean up your
messes, bimbo!

332
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,791
[FRENDA sobs]

333
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,833
[KUROKO] What's going on here?

334
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,208
If you are going to fight,
take it outside the restaurant.

335
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,458
As a Judgment officer,

336
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,250
I cannot allow you to
disturb the other cus--

337
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,500
Sissy! I'm disappointed in you!

338
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,458
You know better than
to start a dispute

339
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,083
in a public place like this!

340
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,458
Hey, hold on!
I didn't start this.

341
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,875
I was just waiting for--

342
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,541
We've discussed this sort of
thing so many times before!

343
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,833
You can't
get into fights

344
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,041
with members of the weaker
general population.

345
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,875
Excuse me, who are
you calling weak?!

346
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,166
What are you, a fourth-grader?

347
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,250
[KUROKO] Heh.

348
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,916
I'm certain you
aren't talking to me,

349
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,375
as I am quite clearly a
full-fledged middle schooler

350
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,583
who was only speaking
out of a serious concern

351
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,000
for your welfare.

352
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,875
Angering Sissy here
is very dangerous.

353
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,833
It could cost you
your life, in fact.

354
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,375
[FRENDA] Like I said.

355
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,458
You should really keep your
nose out of this, little girl.

356
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,375
Your friend would be
the one shredded to bits

357
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,583
if we got into it.

358
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,791
Just like I thought.
You don't know anything.

359
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,541
I'm sure you'll
revise your opinion

360
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,500
knowing she's the
Railgun of Tokiwadai.

361
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,500
Well, Mugino has more
combat experience than her.

362
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,541
She would blow your
friend to pieces.

363
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,416
[KUROKO] Sissy will
rip her apart.

364
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,416
Mugino will win!

365
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,083
The victory will go to Sissy!

366
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:12,916
[FRENDA] Mugino!

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
[KUROKO] Sissy!

368
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,916
[MIKOTO] Hold on, Kuroko.

369
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,750
Take is easy, Frenda.

370
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,125
Okay, fine.

371
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,083
Sissy may have cartoon
characters on her underwear,

372
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,416
and her taste in general does
tend to be more childish

373
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,541
than one might want.

374
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,416
However, as Tokiwadai's Ace,

375
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,125
she is still quite
a formidable opponent!

376
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,625
Yeah, well, Mugino may have her
flaws, like a shrewish temper

377
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,916
and a tendency to flaunt
her underwear to passersby,

378
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,500
but in a fight she's
completely unstoppable!

379
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,875
Honestly!

380
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,375
You think your flat-chested
friend can win against

381
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,625
this kind of power?

382
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,625
How ignorant to think
that size matters!

383
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,000
When it comes to
future potential,

384
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,625
Sissy is the clear winner here!

385
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,250
[MIKOTO and MUGINO]
Get your hands off of me!

386
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,666
Man. I'll never be able to
go to that restaurant again!

387
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,333
Wait for me, Mugino!

388
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,583
[MIKOTO] Hey, we're here!

389
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,041
[SATEN] Ah. Come in!

390
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,000
Shirai, you look
a little disheveled.

391
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,541
[KUROKO] Heh. Oh,
it's nothing, really.

392
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,833
[SATEN] Ta-da!

393
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,708
[MIKOTO] Ooh. Nice stewpot!

394
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,375
Yep, I borrowed it
from a friend of mine.

395
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,416
And I've got the stock
all ready to go.

396
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,875
Wow, that's exciting.

397
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,041
I bet we're the only ones
in town having a stew party

398
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,541
in the middle
of summer.

399
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,625
Now let's be clear.
This isn't a party.

400
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,625
It's a study group, as is
written on our permission slips.

401
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,208
Oh yeah, right.

402
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,041
Well, whether it's an
official party or not,

403
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,458
eating hot food when it's hot
outside is good for the body.

404
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,208
Okay, so what ingredients
did everybody else bring?

405
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,541
Well, actually I had a hard
time deciding what to get.

406
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,208
But the man at the meat
counter suggested these.

407
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,083
So I went ahead and got them.

408
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,583
Boxes?

409
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,875
[UIHARU] Hmm...

410
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,041
[gasps]

411
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,083
[SATEN] Wow!

412
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,000
They're full of
great-looking beef!

413
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,166
[UIHARU] The marbling
is incredible!

414
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,916
Um, is that good?

415
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Not good, Misaka. Wonderful!

416
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,333
What about you?

417
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,250
Oh! Here,
take a look.

418
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,833
I decided to go
with vegetables.

419
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,458
I focused on summer veggies.

420
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,916
Stuff that's in season,
like okra and corn.

421
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,250
And also some
mushrooms and tofu.

422
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,291
Great idea!

423
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,000
Sounds delicious
and full of vitamins!

424
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,250
[KUROKO] I'm up next.

425
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,708
I've brought something
that can enhance

426
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,541
a young lady's
natural beauty!

427
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,833
You should prepare yourselves,
because I think you're going

428
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,541
to be very impressed with
my contribution to the pot.

429
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,083
Sounds interesting,
Shirai.

430
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,166
What did you bring?

431
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,958
I admit I was unsure at first.

432
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,333
There I was, standing in the pet
shop with plump mice in my hand,

433
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,791
not certain what to do.

434
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,291
Plump mice?

435
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,250
You went shopping
at a pet store?

436
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,416
[KUROKO] However!

437
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,083
It wasn't long before
I had an epiphany!

438
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,041
And I knew I'd found an
ingredient fit for Sissy.

439
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,958
Are you going to
tell us what you got?

440
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,625
[UIHARU] Yeah, Shirai we're on
the edge of our seats, here.

441
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:45,833
The ingredient that
I chose is turtle!

442
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,291
[MIKOTO, SATEN, and UIHARU]
Turtle?

443
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,625
[KUROKO] The soft collagen
will enhance Sissy's fresh,

444
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,791
youthful skin, making it even
more beautiful than before!

445
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,791
And that's not all!

446
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,166
That looks like...

447
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,083
[KUROKO] Fresh soft-shell
turtle blood!

448
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,500
Mixed with apple juice,
to make it easier to drink.

449
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,750
Go ahead, gulp it right down!

450
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,750
One glass and you'll
be full of energy.

451
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,916
No, you'll be positively
bursting with vitality!

452
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,750
It's possible
you'll be so fired up

453
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,000
that you won't be able
to get to sleep tonight.

454
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,875
When that happens, I'll come
and lie down beside you.

455
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,125
Yes!

456
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,875
Okay. let's eat,
shall we?

457
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:27,041
Mmm. Oh my gosh!
It's amazing!

458
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,208
[UIHARU] This is the first time
I've ever eaten turtle,

459
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,791
but it's delicious.

460
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,750
[SATEN] The turtle is good, but
I think the beef is my favorite.

461
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,916
[KUROKO] The fresh veggies
are pretty tasty, too.

462
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,083
[MIKOTO] So, basically,
everything turned out great!

463
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,333
[UIHARU] Yes it did.

464
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,458
I hope Haru'ue gets
here before much longer.

465
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,458
Oh, I think she should be
arriving any minute now.

466
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,791
I wasn't thinking.

467
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:47,958
Should we be waiting?

468
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,625
We'll still have plenty
of ingredients left

469
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,791
when she gets here.

470
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,583
[SATEN] Oh, yeah.
I say we keep eating!

471
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,291
You know, it's
a real mystery.

472
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,958
What's a mystery?

473
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,666
[UIHARU] Why is it that food
always seems to taste better

474
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,375
when it's eaten as a group?

475
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,250
[KUROKO chuckles]

476
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,458
Mm-Hmm. I think
cooking it while we eat

477
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,333
like this makes
a difference, too.

478
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,583
I guess there's nothing
that can beat homemade

479
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,250
when it comes to
cookies or stew.

480
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,000
Right, Misaka?

481
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,500
[MIKOTO coughs]

482
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,291
[KUROKO] Hey, Sissy,
what's the matter?

483
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,708
Are you okay?

484
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,750
[MIKOTO] Oh. Yeah,
I'm fine, really.

485
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,208
[KUROKO] Are you sure?

486
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,125
You're panting and sweating,
and your face is all red.

487
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,958
Yeah! I said I'm okay!

488
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,458
Oh! These mushrooms
look delicious.

489
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,083
That's just adorable.

490
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,166
Oh, you're pure
evil, Saten.

491
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,750
[doorbell rings]

492
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,958
Hi, you guys. I'm
sorry I'm so late.

493
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,375
[SATEN] Nah, don't worry!
Come in, come in!

494
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,375
Oh. Hey, Haru'ue.

495
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,750
Oh, wow! Everything
looks delicious!

496
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,958
So, you were able to get
your errand taken care of?

497
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:50,041
Mm-Hmm. I needed to have a
talk to my teacher, that's all.

498
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,208
This stew we put
together is really good.

499
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,333
Let me get a bowl
ready for you, okay?

500
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,375
What's in the bag?

501
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,666
Did you bring
something to add, too?

502
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,708
Yeah, I just picked
up some noodles.

503
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,333
Ooh! Exactly
what we needed.

504
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,750
[SATEN] Sounds great!
Throw 'em on in!

505
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,375
[laughter]

506
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,625
[KUROKO] Yeah, sure, Sissy,
whatever you say!

507
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,791
[MIKOTO] Oh, come on!
I'm telling the truth!

508
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,833
[MIKOTO] Ah, I am
officially full!

509
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,458
I think we may have
to diet after this.

510
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,166
That was a lot
of fun, huh?

511
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,583
We should really have another
study group sometime.

512
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,916
Yeah.

513
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,791
I just wish it didn't
require so much paperwork.

514
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,666
Ah! Paperwork?

515
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,000
We're not late, are we?

516
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,708
No, we're still okay.

517
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,875
I do think we might want to move
a little bit faster, though.

518
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,250
If we are so much as a
minute past our return time,

519
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,583
the punishment won't be pretty.

520
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,708
[MIKOTO] Ugh! Let's hurry!

521
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,791
Kuroko? What's wrong? Come on.

522
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,333
Nothing.

523
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,166
Let's go.

524
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,041
Right. I'm with you, Sissy.

525
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,791
[UIHARU] There.
That should do it.

526
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,416
That didn't take nearly as long
as we thought, huh, Haru'ue?

527
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,333
[HARU'UE] Yeah. Um, Uiharu?

528
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,541
[UIHARU] Yes?

529
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,416
[HARU'UE] You know.
I really am grateful.
