[FOREIGNER 7-A]
This time at night?

3
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,041
What's going on?

4
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,625
I'm sorry...

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,458
There's been a fire in the first
wing of the DNA map analysis lab

6
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,541
that's attached to Shiname Uni--

7
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,833
The cause and the
level of damage?

8
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,166
Still under investigation.

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,708
[MALE EMPLOYEE 7-B]
Sir! Bad news!

10
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,208
There's a fire at the lab!

11
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,125
At the DNA map
analysis lab,

12
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,208
yes I already heard about it.

13
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,666
No, another lab!

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,791
Huh?

15
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,875
[FOREIGNER 7-A] Hm...

16
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:53,958
[FEMALE EMPLOYEE 7-A]
The research data

17
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,625
at Rangaku Medical Labs is gone?

18
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,791
[MALE EMPLOYEE 7-C]
Bio-labs' system is down!

19
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,458
Can you hear me?
Is anyone there?

20
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,291
I can't get through to School
District Three's Thought Labs.

21
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,166
Excuse me,
I'm sorry...

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,208
There are fires in
Shiname's second, third,

23
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,375
and fifth wings, too.

24
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,250
What is this?

25
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,875
An organized
terrorist attack.

26
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,000
What method are
the terrorists using?

27
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,458
There are no signs of
attack from the outside...

28
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,958
And no witness
reports of intruders.

29
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,125
It appears...

30
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,166
the equipment just exploded.

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,041
[FOREIGNER 7-A] Hmm.

32
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,500
New information!

33
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,416
The attacks are coming via
the communications lines!

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,750
We can defend
against that.

35
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,041
Block all external
communications.

36
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,916
[MALE EMPLOYEE 7-A]
Uh... yes, sir!

37
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:38,208
[MIKOTO sighs]

38
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,041
They're onto me, huh?

39
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,958
Uiharu would have done a better
job at hacking these guys

40
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,000
if she had been here.

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,083
But still, that should
more or less take out

42
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,625
seventy percent of
the operation.

43
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,083
Now I just have to get out there

44
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:59,708
and take care of the rest of
the labs more... directly.

45
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,416
[KUROKO] Again, Sissy?

46
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,916
I've got to keep going.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,791
At this moment,
while I sit here,

48
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,000
they could have another
experiment underway.

49
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,291
I can't afford
to collapse...

50
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,875
At least, not before
the project does.

51
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,000
[KUROKO] Oh... Head Resident!

52
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,166
[HEAD RESIDENT]
What are you up to Shirai?

53
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,958
You're acting
downright suspicious.

54
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,416
[KUROKO] Me?

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,625
I don't know what you mean.
I'm not doing anything...

56
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,833
[HEAD RESIDENT]
That's even more suspicious.

57
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,750
[KUROKO] Well, see you later!

58
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,958
[KUROKO sighs]

59
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,833
Huh? Ah!

60

61
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,708
You're actually home!
I can't believe it!

62
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,916
[MIKOTO] What's wrong?

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,375
I'm allowed to be in
my own room, aren't I?

64
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,375
Well...

65
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,208
I mean, yes,
of course you are...

66
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,708
but it's just that...

67
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,208
you never made it
home yesterday.

68
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,708
I had some things
to take care of.

69
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,666
Okay...

70
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,375
Well, you're here right in time.

71
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,208
[MIKOTO] Huh?

72
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,291
Ta-da!

73
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,916
It's Anshindo's special,

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,750
limited-time-only
sweet-treat summer buns!

75
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,291
Remember, you were talking
about how much you wanted some,

76
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,583
so I went--

77
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,416
That's okay, thanks.
I'm not hungry right now.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,291
In a little bit, then?

79
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,625
[MIKOTO] Sorry...
I'm heading out again.

80
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,958
You are?

81
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,666
But what happens if
the head resident

82
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,041
does another one of her
surprise room checks?

83
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,291
Well, if that happens,

84
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,416
you can just trick her
again for me, can't you?

85
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,916
Wait, Sissy!

86
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,083
[KUROKO] Whatever
you're involved in,

87
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,083
it's obviously serious...

88
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,416
and something you
want to keep hidden...

89
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,250
even from me...

90
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,416
Don't you know I want
to be there for you?

91
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,958
[SATEN] Oooh, yummy!

92
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,500
Anshindo's sweet-treat
summer buns!

93
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,458
These are super rare,
limited-time-only products!

00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,458
Oh, yeah?

95
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,166
Oh my gosh they
look so delicious!

96
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,583
Is one for me?

97
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,208
Well, um... it's just...

98
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,250
[SATEN] Hmm?

99
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,375
You're both welcome
to have some.

100
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,541
Really?

101
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,750
But... wait...

102
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,875
You had some of these
yesterday, too...

103
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,208
You said you were going to
bring them home to Misaka.

104
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,708
Are these the same ones?

105
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,166
[KUROKO] Yes, well...

106
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,250
Apparently she wasn't in the
mood for sweets yesterday.

107
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,541
But... that aside,

108
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,791
she seemed to be doing fine,

109
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,291
so there's nothing
to be worried about.

110
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,625
Oh, Wow!

111
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,583
I would recognize
those anywhere!

112
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,125
But those are hard to come by!

113
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,875
Did somebody hear me saying
how much I wanted one?

114
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,208
That's so considerate!

115
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,083
[SATEN laughs]

116
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,666
Why don't you have
some with us, Shirai?

117
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,208
No, thank you, I'm okay.

118
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,416
[UIHARU laughs]

119
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,583
[KUROKO] Huh?

120
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,708
Oh, don't be like that!

121
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,750
I'll make some of the special
tea I've been saving, too.

122
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,916
[SATEN] Mmm, these are so good!

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,041
[UIHARU] You can tell they were
made by a well-established shop.

124
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,916
Possible arson you said?

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,291
Yeah...

126
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,791
There's been a whole series
of unexplained fires...

127
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,541
They've occurred in research
facilities all over...

128
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,125
We haven't received any requests
for assistance from them,

129
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,083
and it doesn't seem
to be too serious.

130
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,875
I wonder
what's going on.

131
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,125
I would put my money on
a bunch of false alarms.

132
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,291
Ah!

133
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,083
I know
I had one left!

134
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,125
You ate it,
didn't you Saten?

135
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,375
How could I not when you
left it wide open like that?

136
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,000
That was a mean
thing to do!

137
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,041
[KUROKO] I'm heading out...

138
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,458
I think I'll patrol for a bit.

139
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,708
Maybe they haven't asked
for our assistance.

140
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,708
But that doesn't change the
fact that arson is involved.

141
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,875
I guess if something serious
did happen, we'd be too late.

142
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,250
My thoughts exactly.

143
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,625
So I think we should increase
patrols from now on.

144
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,916
Nothing out of the ordinary
so far in this district. Huh?

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,041
Oh, come on,
are you really sure?

146
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,791
I'm really,
really sure.

147
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,041
Yeah? That can't be true.

148
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,208
[GIRL STUDENT 7-B]
Well, it totally is!

149
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,625
I'm not being
vigilant enough.

150
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,083
At this rate I'm not going to be
any help to Sissy whatsoever.

151
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:27,791
[MINORI] Hey!

152
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,083
This is one, right?

153
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,333
Oh, wow! You really
found one, Minori!

154
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,208
Okay, so,
what's the number?

00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,833
[MINORI] Gimme a sec...

156

[KUROKO] You there. Kids.

hanging out in a back alley?

00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,416
[GREEN SHIRT GIRL 7-A]
Well, ya see...

159
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,041
[KUROKO] Looking
for lucky cards?

160
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,416
You mean like that Money
Card you've got there?

161
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,541
[GREEN SHIRT GIRL 7-A] Mm-hmm.

162
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,416
Except it looks like
this one's a miss.

163
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,666
[KUROKO] A miss?

164
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,541
[MINORI] Look...

165
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,250
It's got a code on the front.

166
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,916
You want one with a code that
has a repeating number...

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,916
Find one, and it
means you're lucky.

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,916
One with three sevens in a row
is the best you can get...

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,333
It will grant whatever
wish you make.

170
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,791
[SAILOR SHIRT GIRL 7-A] They
say one person who found one

171
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,166
became a billionaire!

172
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,750
[KUROKO] So that's it.

173
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,625
An urban legend that grew out
of the Money Card craziness

174
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,208
that went on a little while ago.

175
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,708
[GREEN SHIRT GIRL 7-A]
Huh? But how come?

176

[SAILOR SHIRT GIRL 7-A] Why...
we aren't hurting anyone.

00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,666
You might get hurt.

178
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,166
This area can be dangerous.
Do you understand?

179
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,333
Get back to your
dormitories, all of you.

180
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,041
[GROUP] Aw, no fair!

181
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,833
Also, as a member
of Judgment,

182
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,166
it is my responsibility
to take custody

183
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,875
of this abandoned Money Card.

184
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,583
[GROUP] Huh?!

185
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,166
[GREEN SHIRT GIRL 7-A] Aw, man.
Can she really do that?

186
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,291
[SAILOR SHIRT GIRL 7-A]
I'm tired anyway.

187
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,208
[SAILOR SHIRT GIRL 7-A]
Hey! Minori!

188
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,333
[MINORI] Sorry! I'm coming.

189
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,583
[SAILOR SHIRT GIRL 7-A]
What were you doing?

190
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,125
[MINORI] Oh... nothing.

191
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,333
[KUROKO sighs]

192
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,583
[UIHARU] Really?

193
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,541
And this happened earlier today?

194
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,625
[KUROKO] Yeah.

195
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,416
Money Cards with
lucky numbers on them.

196
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,708
What a funny thing for
an urban legend, huh?

197
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,833
Almost childishly adorable.

198
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,583
"Childishly adorable"?

199
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,541
That's rich coming from
somebody in that underwear!

200
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,375
[UIHARU sobs]

201
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,166
[KUROKO] It may start out as
a cute little urban legend.

202
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,250
But when people get caught
up in something like that,

203
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,083
bad things can happen
unexpectedly...

204
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,125
Accidents. Fights, maybe.

205
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,583
And let's not forget the
suspicious fires, either.

206
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,708
We should all be more watchful.

207
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,500
[SATEN] Fine. It's still
a cool rumor, though...

208
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,416
If I got my hands
on a lucky card...

209
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,791
what would I do?

210
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,458
There are so many
things to wish for!

211
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,291
I can't possibly
make up my mind!

212
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,958
And there you go again...

213
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,541
What about you, Shirai?
What would you do?

214
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,666
Huh? What're you talking about?

215
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,583
If you found a lucky card that
would grant you any wish at all,

216
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,416
what would you want?

217
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,666
What would I wish for?

218
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,458
Huh. What ridiculous,
unscientific nonsense...

219
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,416
This is Academy City
we're living in, you know!

220
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,500
[MALE EMPLOYEE 7-A]
Regarding the other facility

221
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,041
that was attacked last night...

222
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,416
We investigated.

223
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,458
And we found that somebody
physically broke in

224
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,625
and wrecked the place.

225
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,916
There were no human
casualties... however...

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,916
most of the data and equipment
there were completely destroyed.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,958
At each facility, the locks were
deactivated from the outside.

228
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,791
None of the infrared security
sensors were triggered.

229
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,083
And the cameras...

230
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,875
none of them recorded
the attackers.

231
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,583
Also, and this is strange...

232
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,125
while the incidents
were occurring,

233
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,833
the nearby wind turbines rotated
in the opposite direction.

234
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,833
[FOREIGNER 7-A]
Hm. Interesting.

235
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,916
This business with
the wind turbines...

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,708
That could be caused by
electromagnetic interference.

237
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,000
Uh-huh...

238
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,541
If she is the culprit,

239
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,708
all of our standard security
measures are indeed useless...

240
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,333
What's more, we don't currently
have the force we'd need

241
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,375
to stop her once
she's gained access.

242
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,458
[MALE EMPLOYEE 7-A] But sir...

243
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,791
If this keeps up,
the experiment...

244
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,750
[FOREIGNER 7-A]
...will be shut down. Eh?

245
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,208
[KUROKO sighs]

246
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,083
[KUROKO] Sissy! Be still,
my beating heart!

247
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,416
You look so sweetly
vulnerable like that!

248
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,958
Almost as if you were asking
me to sleep there next to you.

249
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,833
How many days?
How long has it been...

250
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,750
Since I've gotten
to sit this close

251
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,458
and just look at
your lovely face...

00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,375
[KUROKO gasps]

253
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,416
[SATEN] Well...

254
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,458
If you found a lucky card that
would grant you any wish at all,

255
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,916
what would you want?

256
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,666
There couldn't be an easier
question to answer...

257
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,208
I would want...

258
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,125
I would want to be able
to help you, Sissy.

259
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,333
Good morning, Sissy.
Did you sleep well last night?

260

[KUROKO] I'll just go out
there and do my best!

261
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,000

262
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,125
[MINORI] Aww...

263
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,208
Nothing here, either.

264
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,416
[horn honks]

265
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
[tires screech]

266
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,708
Wha- I thought that...?

267
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,166
But I could've sworn I saw...

268
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,166
[KUROKO] Honestly!
Weren't you even look--

269
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,583
You're the kid I
talked to yesterday...

270
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,958
Are you still chasing that
rumor about lucky cards?

271
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,708
No wait, it's
not like that!

272
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,291
Uh... I mean, I guess
it kind of is...

273
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,458
but it isn't.

274
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,375
It's just... well,
uh... you know...

275
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,625
[KUROKO] I get it now.

276
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,750
You want to find one
of these lucky cards

277
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,000
so you can give it
to a friend of yours.

278
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,541
It's a generous
thought...

279
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,625
But ultimately, it doesn't
matter what your motive is...

280
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,875
What you're doing
is still reckless.

281
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,125
[MINORI] I know...

282
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,625
But pretty soon I won't
get to see her anymore.

283
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,458
She told me that
she's moving...

284
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,791
Her parents decided, and there's
nothing she can do about it.

285
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,708
No matter what, I have to
give her a going away present

286
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,125
before she leaves.

287
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,750
We've been friends
a long time...

288
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,250
She's really nice...

289
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,666
and we hang out together
almost every day.

290
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,125
So... I just want to...

291
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,791
[KUROKO] Here, use this.

292
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,958
Oh sorry,
thank you.

293
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,875
She's a really
good friend...

294
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,666
isn't she?

295
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,875
[MINORI] Mm!

296
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,333
[KUROKO chuckles]

297
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,166
[UIHARU] Hey, how far
are you gonna make us go?

298
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,666
[SATEN] Have some faith in
my instincts, will you?

299
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,958
It's nearby...

300
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,916
The lucky card's here
somewhere, I can tell.

301
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,458
Let's give up already!

302
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,416
Over there!

303
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,333
Oh, wait... Huh?

304
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, uh, hey, Shirai.

305
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,333
What are you doing there?

306
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:38,416
[SATEN sniffs]

307
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,166
That's how you're going
to find it? Really?

308
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,291
Just give it a little
time, and you'll see...

309
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,416
The nose knows, I'm telling you.

310
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,791
Now... Why don't you
come give me a hand?

311
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,125
O-Okay...

312
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,375
What are they doing?
They look ridiculous.

313
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,375
For the record, I was patrolling
like a good Judgment officer...

314
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,000
Despite how it
may have appeared.

315
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,750
[KUROKO sighs]

316
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,541
[UIHARU] I am surprised, though.

317
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,750
[KUROKO] Huh?

318
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,166
I just wouldn't expect
you to help someone

319
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,791
who's hunting for a Money Card.

320
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,250
I wouldn't say
I was helping...

321
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,958
I was just looking
out for her--

322
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,041
making sure she didn't
get into any trouble.

323
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,250
I wasn't doing any more than
my Judgment duties require.

324
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,791
[UIHARU] Uh-huh...

325
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,208
Wow, Shirai, you might be
the worst liar I ever met.

326
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,875
It's obvious that
you're doing this

327
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,166
because you want to help her--

328
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,250
So, you
were saying?

329
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,083
Oh, nothing
at all...

330
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,375
But... what are we going to do?

331
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,583
Do about what?

332
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,916
If we really do come
across a lucky card,

333
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,958
it's still classified
as a lost item...

334
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,875
so it can't just be given away.

335
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,625
[UIHARU] I don't see how
we can make it work.

336
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,041
[KONORI] Oh... hey, you guys.

337
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,166
So what in the world are
you two doing down there?

338
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,791
[KONORI] Hmm,
that is complicated.

339
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,541
Obviously, as
members of Judgment,

340
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,000
we can't turn a blind eye.

341
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,666
We have standards to maintain...

342
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,916
But, still...

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,166
Hmm. It's true. A lost
item is a lost item...

344
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,791
This could be
kinda hard to swing.

345
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,916
Impossible,
maybe.

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
[KONORI] Ah! That's it!

347
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,166
I just had a
fantastic idea!

348
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,000
Hey, you two... Listen up!

349
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,625
So, um, what exactly
is this good idea?

350
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,208
You just leave
everything to me.

351
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,666
[UIHARU] Uh...

352
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,041
[KONORI] Well, here we are.

353
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,666
When it comes to
things like this,

354
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,416
I think the lower
tech, the better.

355
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,375
Though... it's a bit cliché.

356
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,000
Ooh! I love clichés!

357
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,166
Konori's gonna
save the day!

358
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,291
What do you mean?
What's happening?

359
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,916
[SATEN] What's happening?
We're searching, that's what.

360
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,916
Huh?

361
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,583
We're looking for
something lucky!

362
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,416
[GROUP] A four-leaf clover!

363
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,458
[KONORI] Here we go!

364
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,875
[SATEN] Hey! Wait for me!

365
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,125
[MINORI] Huh? Wait...

366
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,208
Hold on a second, will ya?

367
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,416
You mean we're gonna
search this entire place?

368
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,708
[KUROKO] We're going to try.

369
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,250
Huh?!

370
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,500
You never know what you can
accomplish until you try...

371
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,625
Okay?

372
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,958
Give it all you've
got and in the end,

373
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,750
you won't have any regrets.

374
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,041
[UIHARU chuckles]

375
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,750
Nothing... nothing...

376
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,666
Nothing here, either.

377
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,500
Yep, it's like
they always say...

378
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,916
Happiness isn't an
easy thing to find.

379
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,791
Oh, please! Don't say that...

380
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,375
You just have to know where to
look, isn't that right, Shirai?

381
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,125
I'm not so sure about that.

382
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,125
[UIHARU] Huh?

383
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,375
[SATEN gasps]

384
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,916
Hey you guys,
look what I found!

385
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What is it? Did you already
find a four leaf clover?

386
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,125
[SATEN] No, not that.

387
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,083
A butterfly!

388
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,541
[SATEN] Oh! There's another one!

389
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,791
How sweet! Those two
must be friends!

390
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,916
[KUROKO] Sounds nice,
doesn't it?

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,666
Being able to
connect like that...

392
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,875
Being so close to each other
without even needing to speak.

393
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,416
[UIHARU] Your efforts
don't go unnoticed, Shirai.

394
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,666
They definitely get
through to Misaka...

395
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,875
So don't worry.

396
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,583
Uh... What are you
talking about?

397
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,208
Why would I be worried?

398
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,291
[UIHARU] And it isn't
just Misaka, either.

399
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,958
We appreciate it, too.

400
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,208
Yep.

401
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,458
[KUROKO] Uh... 

402
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,458
You know, you don't have to
do everything by yourself.

403
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,750
That's right.

404
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,958
We're here for you whenever
you need us, okay?

405
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,083
[UIHARU] Uh... what's wrong?

406
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,541
Was it something we said?

407
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,500
We're just trying
to cheer you up...

408
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,500
[KUROKO gasps]

409
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,666
I actually found one!

410
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,500
[UIHARU and SATEN]
Ah! It's a four-leaf clover!

411
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,750
Amazing! I thought it
was gonna be impossible!

412
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,291
I'm surprised I
saw it, though.

413
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,500
It's a bit on the small side.

414
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,750
Small or not,
it's still fantastic.

415
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,500
Hey... Minori!

416
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,416
Over here--

417
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,750
[MINORI] Found one!

418
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,083
Look! Look! Look!

419
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,875
There are a whole bunch of
them growing right here!

420
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,458
Oh, wow, you got one!

421
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,625
Good for you!

422
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,875
[MINORI] Here's another!

423
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,875
[KONORI] That's quite a haul.

424
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,291
[KUROKO] Oh, you're
getting dressed...

425
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,875
Are you heading out again?

426
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,000
[MIKOTO] Mm-hmm.

427
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,375
I have some things to do.

428
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,833
Sissy, wait!

429
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,083
[MIKOTO] Hmm?

430
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,583
Um...

431
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,375
It's just...

432
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,708
Come back safely, okay?

433
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,416
[MIKOTO] Well, I'm off.

434
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,333
[door opens]

435
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,833
[MIKOTO] Kuroko...

436
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,375
Thank you.

437
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,291
Sure.

438
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,916
[KUROKO] I'll be here.

439
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,958
Waiting for you to come home.

440
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,875
Good luck, Sissy.

441
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:14,916
[alarm sounds]

442
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,666
[MIKOTO grunts]

443
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,291
Sir, there's been
another attack!

444
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,625
That's the third
facility tonight!

445
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:32,916
[FOREIGNER 7-A] Hm.

446
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,958
One more down.

447
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,875
So, that means...

448
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:47,000
There's only...

449
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,458
...two to go!

450
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,250
[KUROKO] A clover that
makes wishes come true?

451
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,625
I only have one wish...

452
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,291
and when you walk
back through the door,

453
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:58,416
that wish will come true...
I believe in you, Sissy.
