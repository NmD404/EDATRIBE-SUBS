"I hope I have not
kept you long.

I am Misaka 10031, your next
opponent," Misaka reports.

00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:32,708
[ACCELERATOR] Huh?

00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,375
Tch, okay.

7
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,458
You guys get kinda
confusing after a while.

8
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,875

Operation confirmed.

Misakas 10031 and 10032

10
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,125

12
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,583
The time has come.

13
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:02,708
We will now be commencing
trial number 10031.

But how?

00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,166
Shot down by some hostile force?

18
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,416
An accident with space debris?

19
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,291
Although.

20
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,291
That's not really
the point, is it?

21
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,583
The point is, the last chance
I had of putting a stop

22
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,708
to the project is now
garbage in outer space,

23
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,833
and then there's the fact that
the experiments have been

24
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:14,500
proceeding according to plan,
even without Tree Diagram.

25

be back here, anyway.

point of this experiment

until a second ago,

I thought I had found your body.

Heh, ha...
I guess I was wrong.

"No, you were correct
about Misaka's death."

261
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,875
Misaka confirms
your observation.

Huh?

[MISAKA 10032]
"Before saying more.

266
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,250
I must verify your

was instructed.

"ZXC741 ASD852 QWE963, well?"
Asks Misaka, testing you.

Uh. Say what?

270
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,541
[MISAKA 10032] It does
not appear you are able

271
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,750
to decode the password.

272
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,875

have obviously not been

read in to the experiment,

274
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,500
so Misaka cannot
say anything more.

"I apologize for having to
leave the cat behind with you,"

00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,958

justifying her actions.

[MISAKA 13-E] "I appear to
have caused undue concern.

result of the experiment,"

apologizing again.

"All Misakas have the ability
