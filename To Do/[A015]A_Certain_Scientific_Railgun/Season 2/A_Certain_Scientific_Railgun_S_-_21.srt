[FEBRI hums]

2
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,166
[MIKOTO] Scientifically
engineered...

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,208
Are you serious?!

4
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,125
[FROG DOCTOR] Hm.

5
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,708
You mean that...

6
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,166
she's artificial...

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,250
made by a bunch of
guys in lab coats?

8
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,708
[FROG DOCTOR] More or less.

9
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,958
No way... You're joking!

10
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,916
I can't blame you for not
believing. Most wouldn't...

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,458
Common sense seems to
negate the possibility

12
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,833
from the very start...

13
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,166
However...

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,333
We humans aren't always
good at knowing the limits

15
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,666
of common sense.
Of all people...

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,083
I have to imagine
you would understand.

17
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,333
I began my investigation
by analyzing the proteins

18
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,375
of which Febri's
body is composed...

19
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,625
It wasn't long before I
realized that they were not

20
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,083
proteins that occur in nature.

21
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,000
Lolly...

22
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,458
Would you like some, Gekota?

23
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,333
For her part, though,
she seems unaware that

24
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,000
she's not just an
ordinary person,

25
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,000
wandering through the city.

26
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,041
Of course, you can't tell
just by looking at her.

27
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,291
[SATEN laughs]

28
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,875
[FROG DOCTOR] Her body
functions very similarly

29
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,458
to the way yours or mine does.

30
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,916
Except there is one problem.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,375
Every time her body produces
new cells to replace the old,

32
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,291
it involuntarily produces
a certain amount of toxin

33
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,208
at the same time, as well.

34
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,208
Toxin?

35
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,541
Yes...

36
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,875
If left alone, it will
accumulate in her body...

37
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,750
causing her internal
organs to shut down...

38
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,666
and killing her.

39
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,791
You must be wrong...!

40
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:40,916
She's doing
better now--

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,541
That's because
of her candy.

42
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,583
A component within it
neutralizes the toxin.

43
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,291
It is no exaggeration to
say that it's those suckers

44
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,708
that are keeping her
alive right now.

45
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,750
Without the lollipops,
she dies...

46
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,458
is that what you're
trying to tell me?

47
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,958
[FROG DOCTOR] I'm telling
you what I know.

48
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,000
Unfortunately, I can't fill
in the details for you...

49
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,166
This could be a mistake
made in the lab

50
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,333
or something
deliberately built in.

51
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,000
But, either way...

52
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,833
If you want to find out how
to keep her body functioning

53
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,750
as it should... The best idea...

54
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,250
is to track down the people who
created her in the first place.

55
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,375
Who is that...?

56
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,541
Who are the people
that created Febri?

57
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,375
And for what reason...?!

58
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,791
Are the people who run this city

59
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,666
starting up another
twisted experiment?!

60
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,458
[FROG DOCTOR] I don't know
whether this will help or not,

61
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,541
but a number of years ago,
I heard some rumors

62
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,208
about a group that
was looking into

63
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,916
scientifically recreating
human life...

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,375
but the rumors evaporated,

65
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,791
and I can't say for sure
what happened next.

66
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,125
So... she's a product
of that research.

67
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,333
At the time, those
sorts of experiments

68
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,166
were the province of
the city's underworld.

69
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,666
Meaning...?

70
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,666
There are some
organizations in the city

71
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,916
that aren't above board.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,458
They exist in the shadows,

73
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:56,250
and are so powerful that not
even Antiskill can touch them.

74
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,500
[FRENDA] In case
you haven't noticed,

75
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,833
I work for the underworld.

76
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,416
[MUGINO] Do you think
this kind of child's play

77
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,750
will get you anywhere against
the underworld of Academy City?

78
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,541
[FROG DOCTOR] I assume you
want to save the girl.

79
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,833
But if you do...

80
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,083
You had better be prepared
to face the darkness

81
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,041
at the heart of this city.

82
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,333
Tell me. Is that something
you think you're ready for?

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,250
[FEBRI] ♪ Ge-ge-geko!
My name is Gekota! ♪

84
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,041
Oh, good. You're back...

85
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,541
What'd the doctor have to say?

86
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,125
[MIKOTO] Oh...

87
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,541
He says that there's
nothing more to worry about,

88
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,083
and we can all get out of here.

89
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,083

ready to go home?

Do we really think it's safe
to go back to my dorm...?

96
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,458
There could be another
attack couldn't there?

That's a good point...

I'll get in touch
with Antiskill.

00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,916
I'm sure they can
step up some patrols.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,625
[SATEN] Yeah... good idea.

101
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,583
[SATEN] That is a long time
to spend in a hospital!

103

like for breakfast?

favorite, don't you?

107
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,750
[UIHARU] Sounds like it.

108

I know something's
bothering you.

[MIKOTO] Uh, what?

111
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,291
[KUROKO] You've looked pale
ever since you got back

112
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,583
from talking to the doctor...

113
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,041
Something got to you.
Something he said.

114
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,333
Uh, You... think I look pale?

[cat meows]

116
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,166
[KUROKO] A cat?

117
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,458
I wonder what it's doing here.

118
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,666
What's up?

119
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,291
Oh, uh... well...
I... um...

120
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,125
I forgot to ask the
doctor something,

121
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,416
so I'm going to
head back there.

122
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,500
You guys go on ahead.
I'll catch up, okay?

123
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,000
Now what are you
hiding, sissy?

124
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,791
[MIKOTO] It's been a while since
we've seen each other...

125
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,583
Is it okay for you
to be out and about?

126
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,916
"I got permission from the
doctor to go out alone,

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,625
so it shouldn't
be a problem,"

128
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,083
Misaka says,
providing explanation.

129
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,625
[MIKOTO] Oh, you did...?

130
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,625
Well, that's good, then.

131
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,750
[MISAKA 10032] I spoke to that
girl who came into the hospital

132
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,833
with you last night.

133
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,666
[MIKOTO] Huh...?
Are you talking about...

134
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,625
You mean Febri?

135
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,166
[MISAKA 10032] Yes.

136
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,291
I could not help but notice
that you stayed up all night,

137
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,500
waiting to see the outcome
of her treatment.

138
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,541
"She must be quite
important to you...

Hey, hold on--

141
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,541
...and yet you waited
for hours out of concern

for this young girl... Right?"

143
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,083
Misaka asks with a pouty look

144
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,916
and a dejected slump
of her shoulders.

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,166
You stop that right now...

146
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,208
It's not like she's more
important to me or--

00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,250
May I continue, please?

148
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,166
Late last night I had
a look inside her room.

[footsteps]

150
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,500
[MISAKA 10032] You have regained
consciousness, I see.

introducing herself.

Yes.

[FEBRI] Do you want
to know something?

00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,666
I have an older sister, too...

162
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,041
I'd like to see her.

Could her sister have been

pauses for effect...

170
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,666
[MISAKA 10032] I sensed that
all the knowledge she possesses

171

seems to adhere to

one embedded at the
most basic level.

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,416

00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,875
Misaka reports,
observing a comparison.

178
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,250
"In Misaka's opinion...

179
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,708
it is not unlikely that
she received her knowledge

180
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,458
through the use of Testament...

181
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,666
In fact, considering
all the similarities

182
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,208
in the underlying pattern,

183
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,625
it is highly probable
that the Testament program

184
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,750
developed for the girl... was
created by the same individual

185
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,500
who developed
Misaka's program...

186
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,500
Says Misaka, expressing
her conjecture.

187
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,125
Which would mean...

188
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,375
...that she's involved...

189
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,708
I haven't seen her
since it started.

190
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,750
Could she really have
something to do with Febri?

191
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,500
Did she get involved with
another screwed-up project?

192
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,041
I thought...

193
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,416
[MISAKA 10032] She was nice.

194
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,791
That other girl...

195
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,291
She showed Misaka what
milk tea tasted like.

196
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,666
[MIKOTO] Huh?

197
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,583
"If it was possible, I would
like to see her again...

198
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,166
to express gratitude... but...

199
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,666
That may never happen,"
Misaka says, resigned.

200
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,625
[MIKOTO] She may or
may not be involved.

201
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,000
Right now I have to focus on
the information I do have...

202
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,875
According to what Kongo said...

203
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,125
the people behind the
robot attack were upset

204
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,458
because they had failed
to "retrieve" Febri.

205
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,416
"Retrieve" implies
getting her back.

206
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,916
Does that mean Febri could have

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,083
run away from them
at some point?

208
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,041
Whatever the case, the best
way to obtain more information

209
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:35,000
is to find out who these people
are and ask them some questions.

210
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:39,083
And if it turns out that the
underworld really is involved...

211
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,333
Then I can't drag Kuroko...

212
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,791
or any of the others into this.

213
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,583
I'll do it... alone.

214
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,333
[cell phone "ribbit" rings]

215
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,791
[MIKOTO] Hello...?

216
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,416
Yeah...

217
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,291
Hey, Kongo. What's going on?

218
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,750
[KONGO]
What's going on, you ask?

219
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,750
I've been on pins and
needles about Febri

220
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,708
ever since I left
you yesterday...

221
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,708
When I called the hospital they
said she'd been discharged.

222
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,875
Oh...

223
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,166
Right, sorry...

224
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,208
Mmm... She's fine now.

225
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,625
By the time we left, she'd
even gotten her appetite back,

226
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,041
so there should be
no cause for concern.

227
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,875
[KONGO] Well, that's
terrific news!

228
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll pass that message along
to Awatsuki and Wannai.

229
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,666
[MIKOTO] Yeah... Please do.

230
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,958
Uh...

231
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,708
I actually feel pretty awful...

232
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,208
I'm afraid in all the confusion,

233
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,666
I might have hurt
their feelings.

234
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,125
[MIKOTO] Huh?

235
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,250
I told them everything that
happened yesterday and...

236
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,333
well both of them
felt really horrible

237
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,125
about not being there, too.

238
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,250
They said, "true friends
are there for you during

239
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,291
the bad times as
well as the good."

240
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,333
"That's what caring
about someone means."

241
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,083
So...

242
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,041
They're right.

243
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,875
I thought about how I would
feel if things were reversed...

244
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:48,916
and, you know...

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,791
I think I would
have been very sad

246
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,458
if I hadn't been
able to help out.

247
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,875
So I feel really bad now for
leaving them out of the loop

248
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,625
like I did.

249
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:02,541
Friendship is a very
precious gift, isn't it?

250
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,375
[MIKOTO] Yes... yes, it is.

251
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,208
Well... I have to go.

252
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,916
Tell Wannai and Awatsuki
hi for me, okay?

253
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,291
[footsteps]

254
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,041
[KUROKO] There you are.

255
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,791
Did you get the
information you were after?

256
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:20,750
[MIKOTO]
Huh...?

257
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh... yeah...

258
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,333
All right then...

259
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,416
Are you ready to head back home?

260
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,083
[MIKOTO] If I'm gonna
act on my own...

261
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,041
I'll need to be
efficient about it.

262
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,416
First I'll search through
all the databases,

263
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,041
keeping an eye out for leads.

264
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,000
[KONGO] They said, "true
friends are there for you

265
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,250
during the bad times
as well as the good,"

266
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,125
"That's what caring
about someone means."

267
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,000
[footsteps]

268
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,208
[door opens]

269
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,458
[KUROKO] Hey, Sissy.
You're going out again?

270
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,958
Oh, um... Yep...

271
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,958
There's something I
need to take care of.

272
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,750
Okay, sure.

273
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,041
[MIKOTO] I'll be back
sometime this evening.

274
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,750
[KUROKO] Well...
come home safely.

275
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,125
You know...

276
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,708
if you need assistance
with anything,

277
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,666
no matter how big or small,
I'm happy to help in any way.

278
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,083
Just ask me...

279
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,583
Whatever happens,
I'm always here for you.

280
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,875
Is there
something wrong?

281
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,458
[MIKOTO sighs]

282
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,041
[MIKOTO] I'm just being stubborn
at this point, aren't I?

283
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,750
Sorry... What did you sa--

284
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,625
[MIKOTO] All right!

285
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,458
Well, here goes nothing.

286
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:39,875
I need to talk to you.

287
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,458
Huh?

288
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,791
Ah! Yes!

289
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,416
[MIKOTO] Hey, your towel,
your towel!

290
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,250
[SATEN] Huh?!

291
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,666
[UIHARU] Easy. Keep it down!

292
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,541
[SATEN] Oh... right,
I'm sorry...

293
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,875
but... you're saying...

294
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,250
..that Febri was
artificially created?

295
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,625
[grunts]

296
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,500
Imagine if your life
depended on eating a lollipop.

297
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,666
Whoever it was who made
her in the first place...

298
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,583
did they intentionally build
that dependence into her?

299
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,708
[MIKOTO] Probably.

300
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,833
They're beyond
Antiskill's control...?

301
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,875
Organizations like
that really exist?

302
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,750
Well, yes...
I think.

303
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,541
Do you have any idea
who it could be?

304
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,083
[MIKOTO] It's possible...

305
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,625
There was this one time...

306
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,375
I got into it with some people

307
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,833
who I think were a part
of the underground.

308
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,625
And they were
extremely dangerous.

309
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,625
If we're really going
to help Febri...

310
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,583
It'll mean taking serious risks
and exploring some shady places.

311
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,291
I want to make sure
you understand that.

312
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,375
I hate the idea of putting
you in harm's way.

313
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,583
And, honestly...

314
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,958
I don't know how well
I can protect you...

315
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,083
With that in mind...

316
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,666
I understand if
you don't want to--

317
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,000
[UIHARU] First up, we somehow
need to track down the people

318
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,583
who created Febri.

319
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,041
[SATEN] Kongo got
a look at that guy,

320
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,125
so we know what at least one
of them looks like, right?

321
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,375
That's a
good point...

322
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,583
Let's fill her in and
see if she'll help, too...

323
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,583
And we should check out
the place we were attacked

324
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,750
to see if we can
get any leads there.

325
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,416
[KUROKO] It's entirely possible
that the surveillance cameras

326
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,375
weren't working due
to the construction.

327
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,250
[UIHARU] I'll check to see
if there are any signs

328
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,625
of a system break-in.

329
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,625
[SATEN] Also, we can't
forget that Febri needs

330
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,833
those lollipops to stay healthy.

331
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,208
I wonder if we'd be able to
make them ourselves somehow.

332
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,833
[UIHARU] You're right,
good thinking...

333
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,541
Do you think you could
look into that Saten,

334
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,000
just to see what you can dig up?

335
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,666
And there is also the question
of that powered suit.

336
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll check with Antiskill
to see if they've been able

337
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,166
to discover anything.

338
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,333
[UIHARU] Right,
that sounds good.

339
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,458
[SATEN] Now, what else...?

340
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,416
Everybody...

341
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,416
Hmm?

342
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,166
Misaka, you've
been awfully quiet.

343
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,166
We could really use
your help making plans.

344
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,083
It'll be best if
we can strike first,

345
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,583
before they have
another go at us.

346
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,375
[MIKOTO] Right.

347
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:52,375
[FEBRI hums]

348
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,500
That sure is pretty.
What are you drawing there?

349
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,625
Gekota!

350
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,750
Yeah...? You're doing so well!

351
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,375
[FEBRI giggles]

352
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,500
When I'm done with this
then I'll draw you!

353
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,250
You will, huh...?
That would be nice!

354
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,125
[UIHARU] We really
appreciate this, Konori.

355
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,625
It's great of you to keep
an eye on Febri for us.

356
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,500
It's no problem...
How's your work coming?

357
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,541
Have you found any
promising leads?

358
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,000
[UIHARU] From what
I can tell so far,

359
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,958
there aren't any signs of
intrusion into the system.

360
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,791
I think I'll widen the search
parameters a little more.

361
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,041
That's an idea.

362
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,416
Look! All done!

363
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,708
Let me see.

364
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,166
[FEBRI and KONORI laugh]

365
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,875
[SATEN] Hi... I'm back.

366
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,541
[UIHARU] Oh!
How did it go?

367
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,666
[KONORI] You look beat...!

368
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,750
Find anything out
about the lollipops?

369
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,833
It's about what
we were expecting:

370
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,833
[deep voice] "It would be an
extremely difficult task

371
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,916
to analyze all the
components of the candy,

372
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,333
and even if we succeeded there,
reproducing the exact formula

373
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,583
would be an even more
impossible undertaking,"...

374
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,708
[normal voice]
So he said.

375
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,958
Oh, that's
a shame.

376
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,416
He did say he
would get in touch

377
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,291
if he found out anything
helpful, though.

378
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,375
Honestly, I'm not sure how much
faith I have in that guy...

379
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,166
A doctor just shouldn't
look like Gekota.

380
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,291
Hey, now... be nice, Saten.

381
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,458
[YOMIKAWA] The powered
suit from the alley?

382
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,833
Yes... There's something we
wanted to check. If we could--

383
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,291
Sorry, too late...

384
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,791
The item in question
is no longer here.

385
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,000
Headquarters has taken over
investigation of that case...

386
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,458
They left with all
of the evidence

387
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,500
pertaining to
it this morning...

388
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,333
They took those security
robots along with them as well.

389
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,166
You mean the robots
from the other day?

390
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,833
The ones that went out of
control at the assembly site?

391
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,375
Yeah...

392
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,791
This isn't the first time HQ's
come barging in, guns blazing...

393
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,541
but they were pretty quick
about it on this case.

394
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,458
Anyhow, I did get
a preliminary look

395
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,541
at what little investigation
has been done so far.

396
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,458
But I can't say there's
much in the way of results.

397
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,041
The whole suit was a patchwork
of unregistered parts...

398
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,916
and there weren't any solid
leads on its footprints, either.

399
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,250
That's disappointing.

400
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,791
I guess there's nothing we
can do about it, though.

401
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,458
[MIKOTO] Well, thank you anyway.

402
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,916
[KUROKO] See you.

403
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,375
[YOMIKAWA] Hey!

404
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,750
Take this with you.

405
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,208
Why, what is it?

406
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,833
[YOMIKAWA] It was lying
inside the powered suit...

407
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,125
Who knows? It may
be some kind of lead.

408
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,625
Are you sure about this?

409
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,750
If it's gonna be taken
out of my hands anyway...

410
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,041
then it makes no difference
to me if it's you guys

411
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,000
or HQ who has it.

412
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,916
With that said...

413
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,916
Don't do anything
stupid, okay?

414
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,625
[UIHARU] Hmm...
What could it be?

415
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,000
Some kind of part that
got detached, maybe?

416
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,125
It seems like they carted off
every other shred of evidence.

417
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,916
What good is this?

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,500
The timing is
very strange.

419
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,416
I almost wonder if somebody is
putting pressure on Antiskill.

420
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,166
You mean like that
shadowy organization

421
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,791
Misaka was talking about?

422
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,750
Maybe. I wish we knew something
more about them, though.

423
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,291
Think hard, Febri...
Can you remember anything?

424
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,750
Even the smallest thing
could really help us out.

425
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,000
Hmm... Mm-mm.

426
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,208
That's okay.

427
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,750
How did the surveillance
cameras pan out?

428
00:17:58,833 --> 00:17:59,791
[UIHARU] No luck there.

429
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,375
Right around the
time it happened,

430
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,916
the cameras all went dark...

431
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,458
Every last one in the area
showed an operational failure.

432
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,958
There's no way...!
Did you check all of them?

433
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,000
Of course...

434
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,208
The entire area must
have experienced

435
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,833
some kind of interference.

436
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,833
That makes sense,
if you think about it.

437
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,208
None of our phones were
working... remember?

438
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,708
[KUROKO] That definitely doesn't
seem like a coincidence to me.

439
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,458
[UIHARU] Oh!

440
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,166
[SATEN] What's wrong?

441
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,500
I was just thinking...

442
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,875
On that same day, not too
far from where we were,

443
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,083
there was some trouble
with the traffic signals.

444
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,000
Like the kind Konori asked us
to help out with that time?

445
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,250
Oh, yeah! Do you think
the two could be connected?

446
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,666
Not necessarily,
but it's possible.

447
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,958
This seems like a lot of
trouble to go through...

448
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,041
Just to track down
a little girl...?

449
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,291
Maybe there's more to their
agenda than we realize.

450
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,958
[phone "ribbit" rings]

451
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,125
[KONGO] We attempted to trace
the path of that creepy man

452
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,375
from the other day,

453
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,916
but I'm afraid we have
not made any progress.

454
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,083
[MIKOTO] I see.

455
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,833
Right... It was a
long shot. Thank you.

456
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,625
[KONGO] We will continue to
expand our search radius.

457
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,291
[MIKOTO] Be careful,
though, okay?

458
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,166
[KONGO] Oh... what about
the powered suit...?

459
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,625
Have you found anything
interesting there?

460
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,625
Well, Antiskill started
looking into it...

461
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,375
but they didn't learn anything.

462
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,375
[KONGO] I'll see if I can
find out something on my end.

463
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,750
Oh, yeah, didn't
you know...?

464
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,166
My father's company has
some research divisions

465
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,208
within Academy City that
deal in powered suits.

466
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,333
Great...
That helps...

467
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,625
Okay, talk
to you later.

468
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,125
Was that Kongo
on the phone?

469
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,500
Yeah...

470
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,791
It sounds like they've still
got some looking to do.

471
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,458
You know,
I wonder...

472
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,541
What was this strange man doing
at the Reach Assembly location?

473
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,625
[SATEN] Well, he was looking
for Febri, wasn't he?

474
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,125
[UIHARU] Hmm...

475
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,666
We cannot allow
Mitsuko Kongo to outdo us

476
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,791
in our search for the truth!

477
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,125
We must keep working!

478
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,291
Follow all avenues!
Consider every possibility!

479
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,583
We'll keep at it!

480
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,375
I'll look into any blackouts
that have occurred

481
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,750
anywhere in the city in
the past couple of days.

482
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,125
I've got an idea...!

483
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,916
I'll go back to where
we first found Feb--

484
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,291
[FEBRI] Mikoto Misaka.

485
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,166
[MIKOTO] We never did figure
out how Febri knew my name...

486
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,125
Somebody must have told her.

487
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,416
Somebody...

488
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,875
[MIKOTO] Was it her...?

489
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,541
But... if it was... Why?

490
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,958
[ARITOMI] We have taken
the necessary measures

491
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,416
with Antiskill.

492
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,583
I doubt they'll be able
to uncover anything,

493
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,958
the bumbling fools...

494
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,541
still... we can't
be too careful.

495
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,416
We don't want them snooping
right before the Reach Assembly.

496
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,666
It's too important to our plans.

497
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,750
We're sure about allowing Febri
to remain out of our control?

498
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,166
We took a vote yesterday.

499
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,708
I thought we had
settled the matter.

500
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,333
Just confirming...

501
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,708
We can all agree that we don't
want anything interfering

502
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:35,833
with our big moment.

503
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:36,916
No need to worry.

504
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,750
Febri will die before
the assembly...

505
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,083
She's a back up, after all,
and imminently expendable.

506
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,041
The Reach Assembly
is almost at hand...

507
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,583
We need to be sure that
everything is ready.

508
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,750
So, is it?

509
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,041
Well, people, have we
overlooked anything?

510
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,041
Oh, no...
Not a chance.

511
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,916
Right, Nunotaba?

512
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,083
All of the pieces
are in place.

513
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,958
I will do everything I can.

514
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,291
[MIKOTO] Looks like Little Miss
Condescension got herself

515
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,166
expelled from
Nagatenjoki Academy.

516
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,500
I can't find any trail
on her since then.

517
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,000
And that means...

518
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,750
I've got just one avenue left.

519
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,250
[FROG DOCTOR] Hmm...

520
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,375
I've performed an
analysis on the fiber

521
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,000
from the capsule
you brought me...

522
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,583
And, interestingly enough,
it seems to be made of

523
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,625
the exact same
components as those

524
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,291
that comprise the
girl Febri's body.

525
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,916
To put it more simply...
This is a hair.

526
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,791
[MIKOTO] Hair...?
One of Febri's, then?

527
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,125
[FROG DOCTOR] No, it isn't.

528
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,208
This belongs to a
different individual.

529
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,583
[MIKOTO] Somebody else?

530
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,666
Maybe... her sister?

531
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,958
Actually, I'm glad
you came by.

532
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,625
There's something I wanted
to discuss with you.

533
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,416
I took a closer
look at the candy

534
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,208
young Febri's been carrying.

535
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,166
Considering the number of
lollipops she has remaining,

536
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,125
I believe her situation
is more urgent

537
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,875
than I had originally
estimated it to be.

538
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,500
Urgent how?

539
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,250
Roughly seventy-two hours.

540
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,166
That is how long I believe
her current store will last.

541
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,625
When they're gone, she'll die.

542
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,166
[MIKOTO] Oh, no...

543
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,375
Isn't there something
you can do?!

544
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,041
It's like I told
you before,

545
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,083
if there is anyone
who can save the girl,

546
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,833
it's the one who created her.

547
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,541
That's your only
real hope, I'm afraid.

548
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,125
Where are you
planning to go?

549
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,541
[MIKOTO] Everywhere...!

550
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,916
Anywhere I have to...!

551
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,333
One way or another we're
going to find the monsters

552
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,291
who did this!

553
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,625
You don't even
know where to start.

554
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,833
I... have no choice.

555
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,625
I will ask you
once again...

556
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,416
Are you ready to
face the darkness

557
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,791
at the heart
of Academy City?

558
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,708
It will be
dangerous...

559
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:47,375
You could very easily end up
getting hurt, yourself.

560
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,625
If it'll save her...

561
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,958
I'll do whatever it takes.

562
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,000
[FROG DOCTOR sighs]

563
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,083
[FROG DOCTOR] The quickest way
to find out about the underworld

564
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,333
is to ask someone who has
connections within it.

565
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,083
If that is what you want...

566
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:04,000
I will arrange a meeting.

567
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,416
[door opens]

568
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,625
[FROG DOCTOR] There is something
you should be aware of

569
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,291
before you go.

570
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,333
[FROG DOCTOR] The person
you are meeting...

571
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:22,250
...is someone with whom you
are already well acquainted.

572
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:28,166
[THERESTINA] Hmm...
Long time no see, huh?

573
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,000
How I've missed you,
my little lab rat.

574
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,291
[THERESTINA] My favorite little
lab rat has come back to play.

575
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,000
[MIKOTO] Hey, aren't you--

576
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:53,875
[THERESTINA] Yes...?

577
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:54,708
[MIKOTO] That one lady...

578
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,000
[THERESTINA] Yes, that's me.

579
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:56,916
[MIKOTO] What's your name?

580
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,458
[THERESTINA] Therestina!
