1
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:34,583
[phone buttons being pushed]

2
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,000
[MIKOTO] Come on.
They're really late.

3
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,666
[MIKOTO] I wonder
what they're up to.

4
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,791
[MIKOTO] Well...

5
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,708
[SATEN] Like I said,
this group of creeps

6
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:54,083
is about to start
some trouble. Huh? Hey!

7
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,166
I was just minding
my own business!

8
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,416
[PUNK 1-A] Hey!

9
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,750
[PUNK 1-A] Whatcha
keep running away for?

10
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,125
[SATEN] Uh, oh!

11
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,666
[PUNK 1-B] Oh?
Hey, now. Wait up!

12
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,833
[PUNK 1-A] You're
not goin' anywhere.

13
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,041
Look, I need some help.
Just hurry, okay?

14
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,250
Okay, okay.
Just a little longer!

15
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,208
[UIHARU] I've pinpointed
the location of Saten's cell!

16
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,041
Good. Nicely done,
Uiharu... Now...

17
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,500
[UIHARU] Hold on
for just a second.

18
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,625
I have to get my armband!

19
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,333
[PUNK 1-A] Huh?

20
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,208
[PUNK 1-B] Oh?

21
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,750
[PUNK 1-C] Slow down, will ya?

22
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,208
[PUNK 1-D] Yeah,
just give up already!

23
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,333
[PUNK 1-A] Come on!

24
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:28,916
[thud]

25
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,833
[PUNK 1-B] There, you see?

26
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:37,875
Start actin' all hasty, and
you'll wind up with a boo-boo!

27
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,041
Um... I, uh...

28
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,708
Don't worry,
Judgment's on the case now!

29
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,541
You made it!
It's about time!

30
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,375
[KUROKO] You five are under
arrest for attempted assault.

31
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,000
[PUNK 1-E] I've never
seen anyone teleport before!

32
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,916
If all of us surround
her at the same time,

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,708
her ability won't matter.

34
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,083
Yeah? Try it.
That'll teach you a lesso--

35
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,666
[MIKOTO] Ah,
that's where you are!

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,291
I got tired of waiting for you.

37
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,875
What are you guys
doing here, anyway?

38
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,458
[PUNK 1-E] Who are you?

39
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,166
Uh... wai--

40
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,083
[PUNK 1-D] Are you friends
with these other little girls?

41
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,625
[PUNK 1-A] Since you were
the last one to the party,

42
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,583
why don't we get
started with you, huh?

43
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,166
Crazy, right?
So then she says--

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,333
[GIRL STUDENT 1-B]
Uh... what was that?

45
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,500
[GIRL STUDENT 1-A]
Lightning, I think.

46
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,666
[MIKOTO] Okay.
Can we get going now?

47
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,541
All the stores
are gonna be closed.

48
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,833
[UIHARU] But, you uh...

49
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,000
[SATEN] Alright, yeah...

50
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,625
Oh, and... Who were
those guys, anyway?

51
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,916
Zap people senseless first

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,541
and ask questions later, huh?

53
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,041
As usual...

54
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,750
[MIKOTO] Eh?

55
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,708
[KUROKO] Home to
2.3 million people...

56
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,250
Eighty percent of whom
are dedicated students...

57
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,333
All intently
focused on nurturing

58
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,583
and developing
their esper abilities...

59
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,625
This is Academy City.

60
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,375
[KUROKO] There are seven people

61
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,333
who have achieved
the status of Level 5.

62
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,875
Among them,
you are ranked third...

63
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,791
The famous "Railgun,"
Mikoto Misaka.

64
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,041
Sometimes
I don't think you really

65
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,666
understand who you are!

66
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,375
[MIKOTO] Huh?
What's that mean?

67
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:19,416
Ughhh! I really have
to explain it, don't I?

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,125
Sissy, your ability
is one people

69
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,458
will both aspire to and
be viciously jealous of.

70
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,500
Like yesterday,
when your rash attitude

71
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,333
made you those
punks' prime target.

72
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,500
People will always
fear you to some degree,

73
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,750
and if you're not careful,
you'll get hurt.

74
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,250
Hey!

75
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,083
Don't text while
I'm talking to you!

76
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,166
It's from Uiharu, she says
she just left the dorm...

77
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,166
I guess you should hurry
and finish up your work

78
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,708
if you want to hang
out with us sometime.

79
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,208
Ah... No fair.

80
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,000
You're always so mean, Sissy.

81
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,500
[SATEN] Man! Whew!

82
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,333
I'm telling you,
it was so amazing!

83
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,875
What would you call it, Uiharu?

84
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,416
An instant takedown?

85
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,291
One shot,
and she blasted 'em all!

86
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,791
That sounds
incredible.

87
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,166
Saten, you're never
going to change, are you?

88
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,708
Wandering around
those back alleys

89
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,458
always gets
you into trouble.

90
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,708
[SATEN] Yeah...

91
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,083
Ah! Well, look at that!
We're almost there!

92
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,333
Let's see, where
is that invitation?

93
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,500
Yep, changing
the subject, right on cue.

94
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,791
So, I'm curious...

95
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,500
Is there any reason
we're meeting up

96
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:22,416
at Misaka and Shirai's school
today instead of somewhere else?

97
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,541
[KONGO] Look who it is! Misaka!

98
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,125
[MIKOTO] Oh, hi Kongo, Wannai,
Awatsuki, how's it going!

99
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,000
Hi there,
it's so good to see you.

100
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,458
How have you been?

101
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,416
[MIKOTO] What's that?

102
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,375
Oh, yeah.
All of this stuff...

103
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,666
Materials for our
summer assignments.

104
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,708
It doesn't really feel
like much of a vacation

105
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,125
when they give us
this much work to do...

106
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,416
Seriously, couldn't
they take it easier?

107
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,958
Tell me about it...

108
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,750
Finding all the material is
almost an assignment in itself.

109
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,541
So, is that
why you're here today, too?

110
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,125
[MIKOTO] Oh uh...

111
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,375
I'm actually just killing time
until I meet up with someone...

112
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,708
I've already finished my work.

113
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,416
Eh?

114
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,708
No surprise there, huh?

115
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,166
Well...

116
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,291
If I had wanted to, I could
have finished in a day...

117
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,708
I just prefer to divide
the work up a bit.

118
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,625
Oh, whoops.

119
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,333
[MIKOTO] That is an awful lot
of books to carry by your self.

120
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,875
[KONGO] Oh, dear.
How could I be this clumsy?

121
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,750
[MIKOTO] Don't worry...
let me help you with that.

122
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,291
[AWATSUKI] Here, I've got a few.

123
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,458
[WANNAI] These, too.

124
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,625
[KONGO] Oh thank you.

125
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,458
[WANNAI] Look!

126
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,916
[WANNAI] It's Shokuho...

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,333
She's always surrounded
by her friends like that.

128
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,916
[AWATSUKI] So she's the
fifth-ranked Level 5, huh?

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,291
How glamorous!

130
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,916
It's no wonder they call
her the queen of the school.

131
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,791
[KONGO] I don't know.

132
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,583
[KONGO] I can't say
there is a single thing

133
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,291
I have ever found to
be likeable about her.

134
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,541
Did I just say that?

135
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,625
I didn't mean to!
I... It just slipped out!

136
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,250
I hope it didn't sound
like I was sniping!

137
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,375
I would never want to--

138
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,750
[MIKOTO] It's okay, we get it.

139
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,375
[KONGO] Well then, I guess
we should be on our way.

140
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,375
[WANNAI] Yeah, probably.

141
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,791
[AWATSUKI]
See you around, Misaka.

142
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,375
[MIKOTO] Yeah. Bye!

143
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,416
[SHOKUHO] Well, hello, Misaka!

144
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,333
[SHOKUHO] I said: hello, Misaka!

145
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,250
Sorry, no talking
allowed in the library.

146
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,208
[SHOKUHO] Oh, come on now!

147
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:21,000
But you were chatting up
a storm just a second ago!

148
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,708
You know,
I have to wonder...

149
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,125
Is it just that you don't
feel like talking to me?

150
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,625
[SHOKUHO] Oh, my!
What have we here?

151
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,375
Hey, stop!

152
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,833
You can't just go grabbing
someone's stuff without asking!

153
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,708
[SHOKUHO] Oh, no!
Now I'm scared!

154
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,500
What's the deal?
Oh, I bet I know!

155
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,333
Is it a present
for your boyfriend?

156
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,041
[MIKOTO] What's with you?
You tryin' to start a fight?

157
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,958
But why would
I want that?

158
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:49,083
Going one-on-one would be
so difficult. After all...

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,875
[SHOKUHO] It
would hardly be fair.

160
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,500
My tampering powers
don't seem to work on you.

161
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,583
[SHOKUHO] I admit,
it's a real pain...

162
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,833
that EM barrier of yours.

163
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:03,791
[MIKOTO] Listen, you!

164
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,041
[RINGLETS] Qu... Queen?

165
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,750
[GIRL STUDENT 1-C]
Are those two facing off?

166
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,458
That could be interesting!

167
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,791
[GIRL STUDENT 1-D] I wonder
what they're talking about.

168
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,000
[SHOKUHO] Like I said,
hardly fair,

169
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,000
but while going
one-on-one against you

170
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,291
would be difficult for me...

171
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,875
[SHOKUHO]
Going up against this many

172
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,041
of our finely trained
Tokiwadai students...

173
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,000
[SHOKUHO]
Well, that would be intense

174
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,708
even for you, wouldn't it?

175
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,583
[SHOKUHO] I'm just kidding.

176
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,375
[GIRL STUDENT 1-E]
I'm confused...

177
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,958
Why am I standing
around like this?

178
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,791
I don't remember
leaving my chair...

179
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:48,458
Oh, hey! Look everybody!
Misaka and Shokuho are talking!

180
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,041
[MIKOTO] I see
nothing's changed.

181
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,916
The way you abuse your
ability is still depraved.

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,250
And to think that
you're the city's

183
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,250
greatest mental ability user?

184
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,791
Misaki Shokuho...
Known as "Mental Out."

185
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,458
Honestly, don't be
such a bad sport!

186
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,916
This is just a warning...

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,666
I thought it only fair
to tell you to be careful

188
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,291
about the friends you're
making these days.

189
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,250
If you attempt to make any
moves into my territory,

190
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,916
let's just say,
it's going to cost you. 'Kay?

191
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,333
Shokuho...
I've got a question.

192
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,041
Well, go right ahead.
I'm listening.

193
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,250
[MIKOTO]
Are you sure

194
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,166
that you're really a
middle-school student?

195
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,416
[SHOKUHO]
That's a good question.

196
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,583
For the time being, at least,
that seems to be the case...

197
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,125
But with my tampering abilities,

198
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,791
just about anything
could happen, you know?

199
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,541
Hello, Sissy!
Uiharu and the others are here!

200
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,291
Come on, come on!
Let's go, let's go!

201
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,875
[MIKOTO] Quit teleporting
out of the blue like that!

202
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,666
[punching sound]

203
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,250
[SATEN] Hey, you guys!

204
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,083
[MIKOTO] Thanks for waiting!

205
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,833
[SATEN] Uh... Did something
happen to your head, Shirai?

206
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,416
A little over-zealous
affection, that's all.

207
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,625
I'm sorry for
having to drag you

208
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,708
all the way out here, Haru'ue.

209
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,666
Nuh-uh. I'm having
a great time, really...

210
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,291
And I've got some
delicious looking snacks

211
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,708
I brought along, too!

212
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,958
There are a lot
of great shops

213
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,333
throughout Academy City,

214
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,166
but they're especially
famous for them around here.

215
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,375
That's true...

216
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,625
Although I think you
enjoyed showing them off

217
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,916
to Haru'ue even more
than going to them.

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,500
Well, it's nice to share
something so fantastic.

219
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,000
I mean, the sheer
elegance of the area

220
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,291
is almost palpable,
don't you think?

221
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,166
I feel like a princess!

222
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,708
It's like the air itself
is scented with roses!

223
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,291
Oh... Is that why?

224
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,583
[UIHARU] Huh?

225
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,750
[SATEN] I was just
wondering why you went with

226
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,416
that particular
design today, that's all.

227
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,458
I don't get it.

228
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,875
What design are
you talking about--?

229
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,291
[UIHARU] B-b-but
how did you know?

230
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,416
[SATEN] Oh, it was earlier.

231
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,208
While you were
picking out your cake,

232
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,916
I took a quick little peek.

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,541
They were so pretty,
especially that rose pattern.

234
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,708
You, too, Haru'ue?
You are being corrupted!

235
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,041
[SATEN] Just so you know,

236
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,083
that kind of reaction is
what makes it so much fun!

237
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,250
[UIHARU] How else am
I supposed to reac--?

238
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,583
[MIKOTO] Now, now, guys!

239
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,708
Let's not waste our time

240
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,250
squabbling with
each other. Well?

241
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,708
Are you coming?

242
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,166
[RECEPTIONIST 1-A]
Here to visit someone?

243
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,083
[HARU'UE] Yes.

244
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,625
[RECEPTIONIST 1-A] All right.

245
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,958
Then please fill out all of the
required areas on this form.

246
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,250
[HARU'UE] Of course.

247
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,708
Wow, Haru'ue.

248
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,708
It looks like you've
got this routine down.

249
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:32,958
[YOMIKAWA] Hey, you guys.

250
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,541
[SATEN] Ah!
It's Yomikawa and Tesso!

251
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,625
Hey, what are
you guys up to today?

252
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,166
Oh! Visiting?

253
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,416
[UIHARU] Yes.

254
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,083
[KUROKO] If I may ask,
ma'am, why are you here?

255
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,500
Has there been an incident?

256
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,000
[YOMIKAWA] Oh, no.

257
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,541
There were some pseudo-radicals
we had to take care of...

258
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,250
One of them is
being treated here.

259
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,833
[YOMIKAWA] He's finally
ready to be discharged,

260
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:56,083
so we're relocating him to an
Antiskill-affiliated hospital,

261
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,333
where we can put the
squeeze on him good and hard.

262
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,458
C'mon...
take it easy, boss.

263
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,416
You were dealing
with pseudo-radicals?

264
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,625
Yeah... you know...

265
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,125
All sorts of problems
crop up in this town.

266
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,125
You never know
what it'll be next.

267
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,750
[EDASAKI] Yes?

268
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,416
Hey, Banri!
You mind if I come in?

269
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,458
No, of course not!

270
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,958
Is there something--?

271
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,958
Just thought
we would stop by!

272
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,125
[EDASAKI] You guys!

273
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,500
So delicious!

274
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,625
This is really wonderful, Erii!

275
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,125
[HARU'UE] Isn't it...?

276
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,958
Uiharu took me to the shop
where they make them earlier.

277
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,958
[SATEN] You two must have
eaten about twenty of them.

278
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,708
[EDASAKI] Amazing!

279
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,250
[MIKOTO] It seems like you're
doing a lot better, huh?

280
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,583
Mhmm. Slowly but surely...

281
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,708
The rehab can be pretty hard...

282
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,791
But having all you come see me
will motivate me even more!

283
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,333
So thank you!

284
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,958
[HARU'UE] If you can finish
your rehabilitation soon enough,

285
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,541
then we can go
to school together,

286
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,583
starting from second term!

287
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,291
Ahh...

288
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,333
So, uh...
Is... anybody else thirsty?

289
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,000
[UIHARU] Eh?

290
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,208
Thirsty?

291
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,666
Yes, I could use a drink...

292
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,166
Want to go see if we can
find some sodas somewhere?

293
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,583
Great idea!

294
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,750
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we'll step out for a bit.

295
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,083
[UIHARU] Wait, you mean...?

296
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,125
Everybody...?

297
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,208
Right...
Come along, now.

298
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,916
[UIHARU]
I still don't understand...

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,416
[SATEN] Misaka,
what's going o--?

300
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,708
[MIKOTO] Come on,
come on, hurry!

301
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,333
Okay! We'll be back in a jiff...

302
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,750
You guys have fun together!

303
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,333
[KUROKO]
A soda sure sounds good!

304
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,791
[MIKOTO] Why it
certainly does, Kuroko!

305
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,416
[HARU'UE and EDSAKI]
What in the world?

306
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,666
[rolling clattering wheels]

307
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,458
[SATEN] Okay. You want to tell
us what's really going on?

308
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,458
[MIKOTO] Soon enough.
Let's get sodas first, though.

309
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,958
[SATEN] So that's it?
Their physical therapy?

310
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,791
[UIHARU] Poor Edasaki.

311
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:09,833
She's working really hard, huh?

312
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,041
[KUROKO] Sissy... Hello! Sissy?

313
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,666
You zoned out.
Is something wrong?

314
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,166
Oh... mm-mm.
It's nothing.

315
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,916
[UIHARU and SATEN] You want
to plan... a surprise?

316
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,166
[MIKOTO] Yeah!

317
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,708
I don't feel like simply
handing over our gift

318
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,958
will have enough impact,
you know what I mean?

319
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,291
It's just...

320
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,958
Well, setting the mood
makes a big difference.

321
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,625
What would be great ...

322
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,625
Is if we could have
it come out of a cake!

323
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,500
Or put it at the bottom
of a champagne glass!

324
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,666
But neither of those
things would work.

325
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,791
[UIHARU and SATEN] How serious
is she about this?

326
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,125
But we could try...
Those things!

327
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,458
[UIHARU] You mean the...

328
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,250
[SATEN] ...flowers?

329
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,208
[MIKOTO] Yes! I call it...

330
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,416
"Operation: Oh, a
Bouquet of Flowers?

331
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,750
But Wait, What's This Inside?"

332
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:01,708
Okay...?
Uh... sound good?

333
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,583
Yes, sounds
like a great surprise.

334
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,458
Doesn't it? Alright,
I'll go buy them!

335
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,583
Do something!

336
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,708
What can I do?
You know how Sissy is--

337
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,208
[MIKOTO] No... Oh, no...

338
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,583
Oh, hey...
What is that?

339
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,208
Oh. That's
Misaka's bag.

340
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,625
[MIKOTO] Awww..
How could I be so idiotic?

341
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,750
It'll be okay.

342
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,250
There's nothing we
can do about it now.

343
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,375
It won't matter...

344
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,666
It's the thought
that counts, after all!

345
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,250
[MIKOTO] No, we can
still do it! Kuroko!

346
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,708
I'll need to use your ability!

347
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,166
You take me with you,
and we'll teleport our way in!

348
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,250
[KUROKO] Sissy, take it easy.

349
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,041
You're getting a
little over-excited...

350
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,125
[YOMIKAWA] Come on!

351
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,750
We gave them plenty of notice!

352
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,875
How much time does it take

353
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,250
to process a simple
patient transfer?

354
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,541
[TESSO] It'll be okay.

355
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,416
You know... Captain...

356
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Wasn't there a guard outside--?

357
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,416
[YOMIKAWA] Hey!
Stop right there, you three!

358
00:14:59,125 --> 00:14:59,583
What was that?

359
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:05,750
[alarm ringing]

360
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,750
[RADICAL 1-A] Come on move it!

361
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,208
[YOMIKAWA] Tesso!

362
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,916
[YOMIKAWA] Call below and
have them scramble... Hurry!

363
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,416
[TESSO] Uh... Right!

364
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,708
[YOMIKAWA] Damn.

365
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,375
[SATEN] Oh... it stopped.

366
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,083
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER 1-A]
Please note that

367
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,625
while the emergency bell

368
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,541
has just rung, we cannot confirm
any fires in the building...

369
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,250
[KUROKO] Uiharu!

370
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,666
[UIHARU] Right!

371
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,625
Huh?

372
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,791
[MIKOTO] Kuroko?

373
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,250
We're going
to look into the situation,

374
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,458
just in case.

375
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,291
You and Saten
head back to Edasaki's room

376
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,750
without us and wait there.

377
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,208
Oh and one more thing...

378
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,875
No matter what
happens, please refrain

379
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,125
from repeating yesterday's
little scene, okay?

380
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,208
Uh... Yeah,
whatever you say.

381
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,833
[EDASAKI] This is kind of scary.

382
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,541
I wonder what's
going on out there.

383
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,958
I'll take a look and
see if I can find out.

384
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,458
Just be careful, okay?

385
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,750
[HARU'UE] Yeah.
Don't worry about me.

386
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,000
[RADICAL 1-B] Almost!

387
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:00,666
[RADICAL 1-A]
Hurry up and get it open!

388
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,291
[YOMIKAWA] Freeze!

389
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,500
It's no use
trying to escape.

390
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,083
There's an all-points
bulletin out

391
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,833
on you through all Academy City.

392
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,083
There's nowhere for you to--

393
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,375
[RADICAL 1-C] Shut up!
I mean it! Stop talking!

394
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,041
Captain, their hostage--!

395
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,750
[RADICAL 1-A]
Don't try anything stupid.

396
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,500
If you do, I'm gonna blow
her pretty little head off.

397
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,291
[KUROKO] The criminal scheduled
for transfer has escaped?

398
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,000
[ANTISKILL 1-C] Captain
Yomikawa is in pursuit...

399
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,000
Reinforcements are on their way.

400
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,166
Where we could really use your
help is preventing any panic.

401
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,333
[MIKOTO] Honestly!

402
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,666
I can't stand it
when Kuroko treats me

403
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,708
like I'm a stubborn child.

404
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,375
She's concerned
about you, that's all.

405
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:40,083
You do tend to be a bit
reckless at times, you know.

406
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,291
[SATEN] But, of course,
that's what we like about yo--

407
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,916
[YOMIKAWA] That's right.
Maintain your positions.

408
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,833
You heard me. I don't
want to provoke them...

409
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:49,708
They have a hos--

410
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,666
[SATEN] Is something the matter?

411
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,958
What are you doing here?

412
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,583
Why, has
something happened...?

413
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,500
It's the pseudo-radicals.

414
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,500
They've blocked our
access to the roof.

415
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,291
[YOMIKAWA] You should go
and find someplace safe.

416
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,166
[MIKOTO] Edasaki!

417
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,250
[SATEN] Why are you out of bed?

418
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,666
Looking for Erii...

419
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,541
She went to see
what was happening,

420
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,250
but she didn't come back.

421
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:12,958
Huh?

422
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,125
What happened to her?

423
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry to have
to tell you that...

424
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,541
Your friend's been
taken hostage.

425
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,333
Oh, no!

426
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,291
[MIKOTO] Calm down!

427
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,166
Thanks for helping me...

428
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,541
But they've still got Erii!

429
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,166
What about her?

430
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,541
She'll be okay.

431
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,333
All right...

432
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,958
Where are you going?

433
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,250
[SATEN] Whoa!

434
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,166
[EDASAKI] What are you...?

435
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,458
Come back! Hey, Misaka!

436
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,125
[HARU'UE] Nooo! Let me go!

437
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,166
[RADICAL 1-C] Be quiet!
And stop squirming...!

438
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,250
C'mon, we're ready
to go! Take off!

439
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,083
[RADICAL 1-A] What?

440
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,166
[HARU'UE] Misaka!

441
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,666
[MIKOTO] You've just
made a big mistake!

442
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,083
That's my friend
you're messing with!

443
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,666
[RADICAL 1-A]
This one has an ability...

444
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,791
All right!
Let's give it more power!

445
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,541
[PILOT 1-A] I am!
My controls aren't working!

446
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,791
[RADICAL 1-C] She wants her
damn friend back, does she?

447
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,291
Well, okay!

448
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,833
[RADICAL 1-C] Here you go!

449
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,500
I've got to catch her!

450
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,208
[MIKOTO] Thanks, Saten!

451
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,750
Can't... Hold... on...

452
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:40,750
[SATEN] Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

453
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,083
[MIKOTO] I've... I've got you...

454
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,791
[MIKOTO] Hang in there!

455
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,291
[KUROKO] Oh, honestly!

456
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:49,833
[HARU'UE] Huh?

457
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:50,791
[MIKOTO] Eh?

458
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,333
I'm okay.

459
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,416
[MIKOTO] Hey, good timing!

460
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,958
[KUROKO] I asked you not to.

461
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,250
But you just had to
interfere, didn't you?

462
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,458
[MIKOTO] Yeah, well...

463
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,916
I couldn't help it,
could I? I mean, if I--

464
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No excuses!

465
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,541
[UIHARU] Thank goodness!
Are you okay?

466
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,916
You didn't get hurt
at all, did you?

467
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,791
[HARU'UE] No...
I'm fine, really.

468
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,875
[UIHARU] I'm so glad!

469
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,166
[HARU'UE] It was
pretty scary...

470
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,833
Ah!! The bag!

471
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:14,875
Eh?

472
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,875
Misaka's bag.
I had it with me...

473
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,250
Huh?

474
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,333
Kuroko...

475
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,250
[KUROKO] I guess we
don't have any choice.

476
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,791
[KUROKO] Whoa, Sissy! Can we
please think this through?

477
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,916
[RADICAL 1-B] Well, I guess
it turned out well enough.

478
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,625
[RADICAL 1-A] Yeah,
you guys saved my skin.

479
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,625
[RADICAL 1-A] What's that thing?

480
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,750
[RADICAL 1-C] Oh. I think
it belonged to that kid.

481
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,916
That girl
with the ability

482
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,083
was seriously
impressive though, huh?

483
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,125
So, she must be what people

484
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,750
call an "electromaster," right?

485
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,833
Yeah... And I'm pretty
sure that uniform

486
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,250
she had on was from Tokiwadai.

487
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,041
[RADICAL 1-A] Huh?
The super fancy school?

488
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,208
Just a second...

489
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,166
An electromaster
from Tokiwadai...

490
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,333
[MIKOTO] Hey, Kuroko...

491
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,166
[KUROKO] Yeah?

492
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,708
Uhhhh...

493
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,125
[MIKOTO] Thanks for this!

494
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,000
[KUROKO] Sissy--

495
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,250
I'll see you a
little later, then.

496
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,791
And you're welcome.

497
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,000
[RADICAL 1-B] I remember!

498
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,416
I've heard about
the electromaster

499
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,125
from Tokiwadai before!

500
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,916
The best electric shock
user in the whole city!

501
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,875
[RADICAL 1-B]
She's the Level 5--

502
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:30,708
[RADICAL 1-B
"Railgun"...!

503
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,500
Welcome back,
pseudo-radicals...

504
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,333
I hope you all had a nice trip.

505
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,750
There you have it...

506
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,041
Looks like she's still
the same old Misaka.

507
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,041
Yep, she certainly is.

508
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,541
But you have to admit...

509
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,666
That's what's
so great about her!

510
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,958
That felt awesome!

511
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,416
[UIHARU and SATEN]
Here! This is for you!

512
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,583
Huh? This?
Are you sure?

513
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,291
But that's Misaka's bag.

514
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,791
[SATEN] Never mind!
Just open it!

515
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:23,875
[EDASAKI] Oh...

516
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:29,000
[HARU'UE] Wow,
that's a school uniform!

517
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,833
If you keep working as
hard as you have been,

518
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,875
I know you'll be
wearing it soon!

519
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,125
[UIHARU] We went out
together yesterday and got it.

520
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,500
[SATEN] Are you surprised?

521
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,625
Mm-hmm!

522
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,708
You guys...!

523
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,625
Thank you-- Uh, Misaka?

524
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,458
Sorry,
I screwed it all up...!

525
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,041
I was working on
a better surprise,

526
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,625
but then there was
all that commotion,

527
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,541
and the stores closed, so this
is what we ended up with, and--

528
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,166
[EDASAKI] Please, Misaka!

529
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,666
I am really surprised!

530
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,750
And really, really happy!
Thank you!

531
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,375
[KAMIJO] Good grief.

532
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:17,916
[KAMIJO] There's never is a
dull moment. Not in this town.

533
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,750
[UIHARU] Misaka is still
as amazing as usual, huh?

534
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,166
[SATEN] Yep. All in all,
I'd say it was a rosy start...

535
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,875
I wonder what color
it will be next time?

536
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,916
[UIHARU] Please just
leave my skirt alone!
