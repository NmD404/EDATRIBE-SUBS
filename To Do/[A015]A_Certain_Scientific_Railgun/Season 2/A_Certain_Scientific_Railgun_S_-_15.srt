00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:23,500
[KAMIJO pants]

2
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:29,166
Ah!

3
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,791
[thud]

4
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,583
[KAMIJO] Ow! Damn it.

5
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,833
I don't have time for this.

6
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,916
I've got to hurry.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,458
Is that zap earlier
making my legs shake?

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,000
Is it that?

9
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,458
Or, on the inside,
am I just terrified?

10
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:50,375
Ah, I may talk a good game,
but I'm pathetic.

11
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,708
No time for self-pity.

12
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,208
I need to get a grip.

13
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,750
It's starting in-

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,541
Seriously?

15
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,250
Of all times to freeze up!

16
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,041
The electric shock!

17
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,500
[MISAKA 10032 groans]

18
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,625
[ACCELERATOR] Hey, come on.

19
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,291
Aren't you guys all supposed to
be mentally linked together

20
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,875
or something?

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,583
I gave one of your buddies a big
hint during the last experiment.

22
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,125
Shouldn't you have had time
to learn from it by now?

23
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,875
Hey.

24
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,125
We have a visitor.

25
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,750
How do you suppose that
plays into everything?

26
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,208
[MISAKA 10032] It's you, but
what are you doing here?

27
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,041
[MISAKA 10032 grunts]

28
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,083
What, are you inviting members
of the general public

29
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,041
to our testing sites, now?

30
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,500
That's irritating.

31
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,166
See, I didn't budget any time
for silencing outsiders

32
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,875
who discovered
our secret.

33
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,416
[KAMIJO] Step away from her.

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,291
What the hell?

35
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,333
Did you say
something?

36
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,250
[KAMIJO] Step away now.

37
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,625
Get away from
Misaka's sister.

38
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,708
I mean it!

39
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,208
Get away from her now,
you damn loser!

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
[MISAKA 10032] Why? Why are you?

41
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,291
[ACCELERATOR] "Get away from
her." Is that what you said?

42
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,583
You've got a set.
Talking like that.

43
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,958
There are seven
Level 5 espers.

44
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,375
I am undeniably the most
powerful one in the entire city,

45
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:25,000
and you stand there
calling me a loser?

46
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,708
I'm sick of
repeating myself.

47
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,541
Get the hell away from her!

48
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,625
Oh, yeah?

49
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,208
I have to admit,
you're intriguing.

50
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,416
But instead of
getting away from her.

51
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,666
How about, I get
her away from me.

52
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,583
[KAMIJO groans]

53
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,625
That was a close one!

54
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,375
[MISAKA 10032] "What is this?"

55
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,541
"What in the world
are you doing here?"

56
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,708
Misaka asks in utter shock.

57
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,083
Why would you take such a
risk for somebody like Misaka?

58
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,166
As long as the
necessary chemicals

59
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,000
and equipment are available.

60
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,666
Misakas can be manufactured
with the touch of a button.

61
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,041
The bodies are fabricated,
stocked with borrowed minds.

62
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,750
The process has been
repeated many times.

63
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,458
There are still nine thousand
nine hundred and sixty eight

64
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,583
untouched units ready for use.

65
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,833
Yet for the sake of a
laboratory rat, you would--

66
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,333
[KAMIJO] I don't care.

67
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:34,250
Manufactured or not,
it doesn't matter to me.

68
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,291
And you're more than just
a bunch of chemicals now.

69
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,833
After all.

70
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,666
You're still the only one of
you in the whole world, right?

71
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,250
That's why I came here.

72
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:49,208
Sorry, but, you aren't
going to be dying.

73
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,625
Not today.

74
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,583
You've still got
accounts to settle.

75
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,333
[MISAKA 10032]
"He'll kill you."

76
00:05:55,416 --> 00:06:00,791
Says Misaka.

77
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,333
[ACCELERATOR] Nice speech.

78
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,083
Did you just come up with that,
or have you been practicing?

79
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,125
[KAMIJO] So, do they ever
give you a day off?

80
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,291
What?

81
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,250
[KAMIJO] Last night,
in that back alley.

82
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,375
Oh. You saw the
work I did there, huh?

83
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,458
Blood flow
manipulation.

84
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,833
My first time, too.

85
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,541
Hell of a performance
though, don't you think?

86
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,916
I mean, who knew there
was that much blood

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,916
swimmin' around in a person?

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,083
Ha! But wind-up dolls
aren't people, right?

89
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,500
[KAMIJO] Enough.

90
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,500
I thought that maybe
they had you doing this

91
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:39,333
against your will, but now,
I see how wrong I was.

92
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm gonna make sure you
don't hurt these girls.

93
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,166
Ever again.

94
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,750
[ACCELERATOR chuckles]

95
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,583
[KAMIJO yells]

96
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,791
[ACCELERATOR] Heh.

97
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,541
[KAMIJO groans]

98
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,708
Oh man, you're slow!

99
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,458
[ACCELERATOR] Seriously.
This is pathetic.

100
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,125
If that's the best you can do,

101
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,375
you don't stand
a chance in hell.

102
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,958
[KAMIJO] Damn.

103
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,000
Heh, heh, heh.

104
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,208
[MIKOTO] I couldn't stop him.

105
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:46,458
I tried. But I failed
at that, too.

106
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,250
Then again. I wouldn't
put it past that guy

107
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,000
to do something
even I couldn't do.

108
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,333
Like it was nothing.

109
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,791
Of course, it's
a lot more likely

110
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,041
that he'll get himself killed.

111
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,250
[KITTY meows]

112
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,250
Hey, kitty. Have we met?

113
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,625
Was that you stuck up that tree?

114
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,583
[KITTY meows]

115
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,041
[MIKOTO] Heh. I'm sorry.

116
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,625
It's kinda difficult to
tell you apart, you know?

117
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,208
[MIKOTO] Like the sisters.

118
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,958
They're the same on the outside,

119
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,666
but each one of them
still has her own life.

120
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,500
They're people.

121
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,208
[KITTY meows]

122
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,708
[MIKOTO] There's a reason
I can't leave this

123
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,958
up to anyone else.

124
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,583
[KITTY meows]

125
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,208
[MIKOTO] I can't.

126
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:36,333
Saving them is still
my responsibility.

127
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,041
Now, let's go.

128
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,666
[ACCELERATOR] Hold on.

129
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,916
Could he be?

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,208
[KAMIJO coughs]

131
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,291
[ACCELERATOR] By any chance,
are you a non-esper?

132
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,458
The way you showed up
and started trash talking,

133
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,416
I thought you must
have... some rank,

134
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,583
but now I'm starting to think
I was wrong about that.

135
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,708
You're the smallest fry
out there, aren't you?

136
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,041
[ACCELERATOR] I don't like this.

137
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,625
[KAMIJO grunts]

138
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,333
[ACCELERATOR] There have been
any number of misguided idiots

139
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,375
who have challenged
me to a fight,

140
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,625
hoping to win
top-dog status.

141
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,625
And there's
always a moment,

142
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,333
frequently after losing
an eye or a limb.

143
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,833
when they realize their mistake.

144
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,375
Their faces contort in an
agony of regret and terror.

145
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,208
Tch.

146
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,166
And then there's
this guy.

147
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,333
[ACCELERATOR] Come on.

148
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,583
You've gotta know by now I'm
exponentially stronger than you.

149
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,958
Of course, if you want
to die that badly,

150
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,166
I'm happy to oblige by
blowing you to pieces.

151
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,375
You see that
container over there?

152
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,250
Seems there was flour in it.

153
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,833
And there's no
wind tonight, either.

154
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,666
It's nice and calm.

155
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,666
That could turn this into a
really dangerous situation.

156
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,750
[KAMIJO gasps]

157
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,125
[ACCELERATOR] Hey third-string,
have you ever heard

158
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,041
of something called
a dust explosion?

159
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:25,541
[KAMIJO groans]

160
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,500
[ACCELERATOR] Yeah.

161
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,875
Dust explosions are nasty.

162
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,833
Next time I try that,
I should remember not to

163
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,291
put myself in the
middle of it, though.

164
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,166
I always thought I could survive
even a nuclear explosion.

165
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,583
I may need to reconsider that.

166
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,541
Oh?

167
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,500
You're going to keep
trying to fight me?

168
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,875
Really?

169
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,250
[distant explosion]

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,666
[MIKOTO] An explosion?

171
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,458
Oh, no! Is he?

172
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,875
[KITTY meows]

173
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,833
[MIKOTO] Sorry.

174
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,916
But I can't drag you
into this mess, too.

175
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,958
[ACCELERATOR] In a way
you're actually lucky

176
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,333
that you don't have
any esper ability.

177
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:13,958
My "Reflection" skill doesn't
work well on somebody so weak.

178
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:18,208
You know, strange as it is,
you've done pretty well so far.

179
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,750
You're still alive, and,
considering I'm your opponent,

180
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,250
that's a miracle.

181
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,875
I'm getting bored, though.

182
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,500
So let's put an end
to this, shall we?

183
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,166
Pick a hand,
any hand.

184
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,208
It doesn't matter
which touches you.

185
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,625
With either one I can reverse
the flow of your blood,

186
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,083
resulting in a messy death.

187
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,791
So, which one
will it be?

188
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,375
The right hand?

189
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,375
Or the left hand?

190
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,875
Or both?

191
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,000
[punch]

192
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,000
[ACCELERATOR] The moon?

193
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,583
What am I looking
at the moon for?

194
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,583
I guess because
I'm flat on my back.

195
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,958
But what the hell am I doing
lying on the ground?

196
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,000
Huh? Him?

197
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,500
He was just in front
of me. How did he?

198
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,916
Wait. Never mind where he is.

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
How is he still standing
there in one piece?

200
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,416
What the? I'm hurt?

201
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,291
I'm even bleeding?

202
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,083
What the hell
happened here?!

203
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,833
He knocked me
on my ass?

204
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,916
Me? Impossible!

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,625
If he did that, his
arm should be broken.

206
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,583
How could he even touch me?

207
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,083
[footstep]

208
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,083
[ACCELERATOR laughs]

209
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,500
I must've focused
everything into my hands,

210
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,625
shutting down the "Reflection"
around the rest of me.

211
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,291
Damn, what an
idiotic move!

212
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,583
Impressive. Ha, heh, ha, ha!

213
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,166
No, I mean it. That was good.

214
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,666
A solid hit! I'll give you that.

215
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,166
You really nailed me! But now!

216
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,583
[MIKOTO] No way.

217
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:31,666
He's fighting Accelerator,
and he's on the offensive?

218
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,708
Against the strongest
guy in Academy City?

219
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,083
He's basically
a stranger.

220
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,125
We're certainly not friends.

221
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,875
He could walk away.

222
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,000
Nobody would blame him.

223
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,083
But instead...

224
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,500
He's keeping his promise.

225
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,125
[ACCELERATOR]
Damn you! Stop moving!

226
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,791
What is the deal with
your right hand, huh?

227
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,375
I wouldn't get too carried away
if I were you, Third string!

228
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,458
[KAMIJO winces]

229
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,041
[ACCELERATOR laughs]

230
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,041
[KAMIJO] You should never have
gotten involved with this.

231
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:27,000
So many Sisters, living
the best that they can.

232
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,583
They use up all their
strength just to fight you.

233
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,083
They deserve better.

234
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,750
They're living beings.

235
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,041
Not fodder for some
ruthless bastard.

236
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,041
[ACCELERATOR] They're living?

237
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,375
What's he talking about?

238
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:50,375
They're just
wind-up dolls.

239
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,916
That's what they
said, isn't it?

240
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,000
I need power.

241
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,416
The power to make him
stop saying this stuff.

242
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,208
No, more.

243
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,333
I need the dominion
over reason and rules

244
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,958
that comes from absolute power!

245
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:27,375
[ACCELERATOR babbles]

246
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,041
[KAMIJO yells]

247
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,625
[MIKOTO] Where did all
this wind come from?

248
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,125
[MIKOTO gasps]

249
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,833
[thud]

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,291
Is, is he?

251
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,583
No.

252
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,000
No!

253
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,958
[ACCELERATOR] The air,
the wind, the atmosphere.

254
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,750
I can win this fight.

255
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,458
I've got the means to kill
that piece of crap right here,

256
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,000
all around me.

257
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,125
If I could control
the direction of the air

258
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,458
that's flowing through
the atmosphere.

259
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,583
If I could control the
world's wind currents,

260
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,916
I could destroy
anything I want to.

261
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,791
My reach would be infinite.

262
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,666
My power would be
absolutely unstoppable!

263
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,375
The strongest esper
in Academy City?

264
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,750
The only Level 6?

265
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,791
I wouldn't need that anymore!

266
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,125
There would be nothing
and nobody in the universe

267
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,458
who could stop me!

268
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,208
The world and everything
in it is in my hand!

269
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,916
Compress it.
Compress all the air!

270
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,708
Hey, third string!

271
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,166
You have given me
a fantastic idea!

272
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,791
What happened to all
that spunk you had?

273
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,083
Come on! Get up! Get up!

274
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,541
I need you to stick with me
for a little longer here.

275
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,750
Okay?

276
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,458
It's almost over now!

277
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,500
[MIKOTO] Accelerator!

278
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,208
Stay right
where you are.

279
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,416
[KAMIJO] D-Don't do it.

280
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,166
Misaka...

281
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,708
[MIKOTO] I can't believe it.

282
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,458
He's alive!

283
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:19,041
I'm sorry. I know you
wanted a happy ending,

284
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,833
but once I die, the experiments
will finally be over.

285
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,416
It might be selfish.

286
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,625
I know that, but still--I don't
want you to die because of me.

287
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,416
So now.

288
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,375
[MIKOTO] What in
the world is that?

289
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:47,291
He's compressing the wind into
one point to create plasma?

290
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,333
What's his plan?

291
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,458
To blow this whole area away?

292
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,625
Those eyes. They're so blank.

293
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,583
He paid me no more
attention than an insect.

294
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,375
Obviously the only thing he's
interested in at all right now

295
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,333
is testing his new power.

296
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,083
What do I do? What can I?

297
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,958
He's compressing all the wind
in the city into one point.

298
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,375
Maybe, if I use all the
windmills around town.

299
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,000
Sure, But how?

300
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,458
I can't do it by myself!

301
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,833
[MIKOTO] Please!
You have to wake up!

302
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,208
[MIKOTO] She's freezing.

303
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,375
In the shape she's in now,
how can I ask this of her?

304
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,625
I realize that I'm
asking a lot of you,

305
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,083
and with everything
that's happened,

306
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,500
I know I don't have the right.

307
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,750
But please!

308
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,958
Please, there's something
I need you to do!

309
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,750
It's, it's something
that only you can do!

310
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,958
I hate this!

311
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,958
Why do I have to be
so damn powerless?

312
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,958
I can't do this.

313
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,208
I can't protect everyone myself!

314
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,500
The Ace of Tokiwadai?

315
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,791
One of only seven Level 5s.

316
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,208
And I can't do anything!

317
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,083
I can't heal her injuries.

318
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,375
I can't stop Accelerator.

319
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,791
I can't give Kamijo
the ending he wants!

320
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,958
Please get up! I'm begging you!

321
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:25,000
Get up and do what you can.
Not for me, but for him!

322
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:29,541
[MISAKA 10032] I am confused.

323
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:33,291
I'm not sure I understand
everything you are saying.

324
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:37,166
But for some reason...

325
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,250
I find your words moving.

326
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,875
So I am happy to help you.

327
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,750
[ACCELERATOR] Amazing!

328
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,875
It's like a part of my body!

329
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,875
Like moving my own arms or legs!

330
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,875
All of this air is completely
under my control!

331
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,333
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

332
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,958
So fighting someone stronger
really was a shortcut

333
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,833
to leveling up! Guess
they were right all along!

334
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,833
Thanks, third-string!

335
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,375
You served your purpose well,

336
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,541
and now I'm going
to destroy you! Huh?

337
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,041
How could this be
happening now?

338
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,375
It looks like the
plasma is diffusing.

339
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,958
I know there were no
glitches in my calculations,

340
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:19,166
and this is too irregular
to be a natural wind.

341
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,625
Thanks, you did great.

342
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,458
You can let me
take it from here.

343
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,708
[MIKOTO] I should be able to
create a big enough opening

344
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,916
for them to escape.

345
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
[MISAKA 10032] I can do it.

346
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,291
If Misaka interferes
with the target

347
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,000
he will focus his attention
on her and be distracted.

348
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:43,125
Then you can take the boy,
and leave this place.

349
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,291
I don't think so.

350
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,625
You've already done
more than enough.

351
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,166
Let your big sister
take it from here.

352
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,416
[ACCELERATOR] Why is the wind
suddenly acting like this?

353
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,041
It's not wind
manipulation. So, what?

354
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,583
The windmills are
turning the wrong way.

355
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,333
Hold on. I've heard
about this before.

356
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,333
It's something about
dynamo motors.

357
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,666
When they're hit by particular
electromagnetic waves, they--

358
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,125
Is it them?

359
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,166
Damn it.

360
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,000
What do they think
they're doing?

361
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,708
Those windmills aren't just
spinning around haphazardly.

362
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,833
They're being directed
to disrupt my formulas!

363
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,041
[ACCELERATOR] She's doing it!

364
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,625
The images she sees are
going across the network!

365
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,416
I'm gonna' kill you!

366
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,666
I won't let you!

367
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,500
[KAMIJO] That voice.

368
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,666
[MIKOTO] You managed
to defeat me,

369
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,708
both in town and
out by the riverbed.

370
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,083
They're nothing
but big computers

371
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,375
programmed to control us.

372
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,041
If my one life can save
ten thousand of theirs,

373
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,958
that's a good thing isn't it?

374
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,083
It's not much, but
maybe it's enough?

375
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,791
Please, help.

376
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,500
Somebody help.

377
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,958
Please help me.

378
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,000
[ACCELERATOR] I'm not gonna
to let any of you weaklings

379
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,416
stand in my way anymore!

380
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,041
No matter what, I will
become invincible!
