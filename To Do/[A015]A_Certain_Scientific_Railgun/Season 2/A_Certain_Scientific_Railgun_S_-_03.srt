00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,458
So, like I was saying...

2
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,208
[MIKOTO] Good morning!

3
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,166
Eh?

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,750
Oh, hey. It's Misaka...

5
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,375
Um... You got here
pretty quickly, huh?

6
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:36,208
Huh? Quickly? No...
Same time as normal.

7
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,500
Really? But we just
saw you in town.

8
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,875
Yeah, it was definitely
you, and you were walking

9
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,250
in the opposite direction
from the school.

10
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,375
Oh... well, that's
impossible, isn't it?

11
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,416
You must've seen someone
who looks like me.

12
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,833
[GIRL STUDENT 3-C]
Clones? That's crazy!

13
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,083
[GIRL STUDENT 3-D] I mean it!

14
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,583
There's a story that's
been going around

15
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,708
about a project designed
to clone Level 5 espers.

16
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,833
You haven't heard of it?

17
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,583
No, I haven't.

18
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,958
Sounds pretty amazing though?

19
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,833
[MIKOTO] Really? The rumors
get dumber every day.

20
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,250
[BOY STUDENT 3-A] Seriously!

21
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,416
You mean they're mass-producing
them to use as weapons!

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,708
Oh, yeah, it'll be
common practice soon.

23
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:14,583
[BOY STUDENT 3-A] No way!

24
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,958
[BOY STUDENT 3-B] Absolutely!

25
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,583
[MIKOTO] That's ridiculous.

26
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,333
[GIRL STUDENT 3-E]
Think about it:

27
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:23,125
there are only seven
Level 5s in Academy City, right?

28
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,916
[GIRL STUDENT 3-F] So, which
of them are they cloning?

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,500
[MIKOTO] Oh, come on!

30
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,958
Well... That's just the thing.
I heard who they might be using.

31
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:33,208
The Level 5 is supposedly
that Railgun girl.

32
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,333
[NUNOTOBA] So, it's you...

33
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,041
The Original.

34
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,666
Original? Sorry?

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,166
[NUNOTOBA] You must at least
have heard the rumors, right?

36
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,291
What rumors?

37
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,625
[sighs]

38
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,250
[MIKOTO] Hmph... I have
to say, I'm surprised.

39
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,416
I guess the students at
Nagatenjoki like gossip

40
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,333
as much as anyone, huh?

41
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,833
So... that's all?

42
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,000
You've heard some rumors,

43
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,041
but do you actually
know anything-

44
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,958
You are still a
middle-schooler.

45
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,041
But I am a high-schooler...

46
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,250
And you will
observe my seniority...

47
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,625
Basically... Watch
your tone with me.

48
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,708
I... I was just
wondering if you had

49
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,208
any more substantial
information about it.

50
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,208
More than you do...

51
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,000
Although, from
what I can tell...

52
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,666
Their methods and objectives

53
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,833
have changed considerably
since I was there.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,000
[NUNOTOBA] Knowing more
would only hurt you.

55
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,250
What's the point

56
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,583
when there's nothing you
can do about it, anyway?

57
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,541
I asked you
for information,

58
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,875
not for protection...

59
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,041
And what do you mean
<i>I</i> can't do anything?

60
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,083
Are you saying there's
something that you can--

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
[MIKOTO] Is there, maybe,
something that you can do?

62
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,250
I have taken some
action already.

63
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,833
Distributing those Money Cards
was part of the plan.

64
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:39,541
The plan to eliminate
this city's blind spots.

65
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,375
[NUNOTOBA] Placing the
Money Cards all over directs

66
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,291
people's attention to the
alleys and back streets

67
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,500
that the surveillance
cameras don't reach.

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,750
[NUNOTOBA] By doing so,
I hoped I could put an end

69
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,000
to the experiments

70
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,416
that have been taking
place in the shadows.

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,666
Of course...

72
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,625
I was careless enough
to let myself be spotted

73
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,250
by those thugs and they
followed me back here.

74
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,875
[NUNOTOBA]
If they had seen this,

75
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,541
it could have created some
serious problems for me...

76
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,875
As always...

77
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,166
Leaving physical
evidence isn't smart.

78
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,875
I'm not legitimately
renting this place, either.

79
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,875
It would be best if we got out
of here before they woke up.

80
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,416
[MIKOTO] Hold on a second!

81
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,333
I mean...
Please tell me...

82
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,375
What are you even talking about?

83
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,875
And who exactly are you--?

84
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,375
Now you're thinking...

85
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,541
"As long as I'm destroying
physical evidence,

86
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,416
shouldn't I get rid
of the witnesses, too?"

87
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,666
Whoa, I am not!

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,291
Come on, we need
to get these guys...

89
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,333
[NUNOTOBA] Not my problem.

90
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,000
[MIKOTO] Eh?!

91
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,958
[FEMALE ONLOOKER 3-A]
What's going on? Is it a fire?

92
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,541
[MALE ONLOOKER 3-A]
Yeah, a small one...

93
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,875
Doesn't look like
anyone was hurt, though.

94
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,666
[MIKOTO] Man!
Who was that psycho?

95
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,333
She actually got
two good hits on me...

96
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,916
and said nothing I understood.

97
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,333
Why am I taking
anything she said seriously?

98
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,708
That's it! I'm just
wasting my time...

99
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,625
I'm going to head home,
have a nice shower...

100
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,500
and hit the sack.

101
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,916
[MIKOTO] It's ridiculous...

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,666
I don't care how many people
said it, it isn't true...

103
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,416
There's just no way...

104
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,416
There are no clones of me.

105
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,916
[MIKOTO] Although...

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
[FEMALE TEACHER 3-A] As you can
see, the model DNA information

107
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,500
is absolutely indispensable
to cloning technology...

108
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,166
[MIKOTO] It's true...

109
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,000
I did give someone
my DNA map once...

110
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,833
but that was a long time ago...

111
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,041
and it was for a
different reason...

112
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,958
I'm sure he put it to good use.

113
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,791
Besides... not
long afterwards...

114
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,416
that hospital was closed
down for good... and now...

115
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,458
[MIKOTO] She goes
to Nagatenjoki Academy.

116
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,416
I can hack into the

00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,416

Uh... are you okay?

174
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,041
[SATEN] I've been beaten.

175
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,958
Uh... I'm sorry...

176
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,375
Anyway, I hope you're hungry

177
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,000
'cause I bought
all of us supper!

178
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,750
[HARU'UE] Ooh, I'm starving!

179
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,916
[UIHARU] Mmm...
it smells delicious!

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
[HARU'UE] Yeah.

181
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,791
[SATEN] It doesn't
sound so good to me.

182
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,541
I like this stuff as much
as the next person...

183
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,416
But maybe you could've gotten
something cold instead?

184
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,625
[UIHARU] Really?

185
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,208
I actually think it
was a perfect choice...

186
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,958
Hot meals taste even
better in hot weather!

187
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,333
It's so good!

188
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,208
You've converted her.

189
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,750
Wow, these are
delicious, Haru'ue!

190
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:37,791
You think so?

191
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,875
Mm-hmm.

192
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,666
[UIHARU]
Oh, that's right... I forgot.

193
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,875
You've taken up cooking
lately, haven't you?

194
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,041
[SATEN] Oh, yeah?

195
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,875
Uh... Well...
I'm still learning.

196
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,250
[SATEN] Really?

197
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,083
As far as I'm concerned,
this is just about perfect!

198
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,625
You know my secret?

199
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,083
I add a little bit of soy sauce
and oyster sauce to the mix.

200
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,125
It's absolutely fantastic!

201
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,458
[UIHARU] Mmm-hmm...

202
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,416
I think it's exactly
what this meal needed!

203
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,666
[HARU'UE] It complements the
strawberries' sweetness, huh?

204
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,666
[UIHARU] It sure does!

205
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,666
I just realized
I used up the rice.

206
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,500
We don't have
any for tomorrow.

207
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,583
That's okay...

208
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,250
I'm sure we can
make do without it...

209
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,500
Although...
It would be nice

210
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,333
if we had a larger rice
cooker, wouldn't it?

211
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,500
You two do eat a
lot of the stuff, huh?

212
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,708
[HARU'UE] Do... Do we, really?

213
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,375
[UIHARU] Oh...
by the way, Saten...

214
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,041
I was wondering,
what did you mean

215
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,166
by what you said on
the phone earlier?

216
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,625
[SATEN] Huh?
About what?

217
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,125
[UIHARU] The stuff you were
saying about Misaka...

218
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,250
Something about
a mistaken identity?

219
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,791
[SATEN] Oh, that.
It was no big deal, really...

220
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,500
I just thought I saw somebody

221
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,500
who looked like her
that's all... Although...

222
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,333
Oh... never mind...

223
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,583
They say everybody
in the world

224
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,125
has a look-alike out
there somewhere.

225
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,666
I probably just
thought it was her

226
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,125
because she was wearing
a Tokiwadai Uniform.

227
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,375
[HARU'UE] Now that
you mention it...

228
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,375
Misaka and Shirai always seem
to be wearing their uniforms.

229
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,750
Tokiwadai requires
students to wear uniforms

230
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,500
at all times, even
outside of school.

231
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,833
That's pretty strict.

232
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,541
I can see why
you might think that...

233
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,250
but those uniforms
are constant proof

234
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,000
that they are
young ladies.

235
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,250
I have a hard time
imagining Misaka

236
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,916
wearing anything
but her uniform.

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,375
[HARU'UE] Oh, yeah?

238
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,791
Okay, but still...

239
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,916
It would be nice to see them

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,625
in street clothes
sometimes, you know?

241
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,708
Okay... well...

242
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,791
Alright! Here I go!

243
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,666
That was a close one...

244
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,000
She seemed bound and determined

245
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,416
to find someone
to punish tonight.

246
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,666
Still not back.

247
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,208
It's long past curfew now.

248
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,833
What are you doing out there?

249
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,625
Oh, Sissy!!

250
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,666
Oh, how improper of me.

251
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,375
I should be ashamed of myself!

252
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:18,708
But then... It has
been a really long time!

253
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,875
[KUROKO] Siiissssy!!

254
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,125
What the...
What was that?

255
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,666
I just got a creepy
chill down my spine.

256
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,291
Oh, well... It's gone now.

257
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,875
[KANAMIN] Transform!
Magical Powered Kanam--

258
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,250
[WATCHMAN 3-A] Huh?

259
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,916
Hey, what's going
on with this thing?

260
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,250
I just bought it...
Stupid piece of junk.

261
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,916
[KANAMIN] Okay! Are you ready!

262
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,541
[WATCHMAN 3-A] Oh, that did it.

263
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,250
[GUARD 3-A] Ugh! I lost again?

264
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,833
Hah! You get to
make the rounds now.

265
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,750
Yeah, I know...
Don't rub it in.

266
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,875
I still don't see why
we have to do rounds...

267
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,458
This place has
airtight security.

268
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,625
[GUARD 3-B] Yeah, yeah.

269
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,666
Quit your griping
already and get to it.

270
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,208
[GUARD 3-A] I'm goin'!

271
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,291
[MIKOTO] Security cameras,
infrared sensors,

272
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,083
and electronic locks.

273
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,416
They've got it all...

274
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,250
But, since everything
depends on electricity,

275
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,958
I should be fine.

276
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,333
[MIKOTO] I just have to
make sure to keep an eye out

277
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,000
for guards and any
other late-night staff.

278
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,666
[MIKOTO] Hmm?
That doesn't make sense...

279
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,916
No departments match
what I'm looking for.

280
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,916
Wait... There is a
section that has power

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,083
but is disconnected
from the network.

282
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,833
[MIKOTO] I was
wondering why they

283
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,875
only put surveillance
cameras in the hallways.

284
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,291
But I guess it's
because they don't want

285
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,791
other departments to know
what they're researching.

286
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,375
[MIKOTO] All right...

287
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,291
I think I'll start by
checking that section.

288
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,708
[GUARD 3-A] Who's there?

289
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,583
I-I'm not imagining
things am I?

290
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,250
Is someone there? Show yourself!

291
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,666
[MIKOTO] Uh-oh...

292
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,000
[MIKOTO] What do I do?

293
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,250
Worst case, I guess
I could always

294
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,750
shock him unconscious
and get myself out ...

295
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,083
But I'd really rather not leave
any trace that I was here.

296
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,041
[MIKOTO] Let me think...

297
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,166
[GUARD 3-A] What's this?

298
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,041
A security robot!
Of course it is...

299
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,166
There's no way anyone
could get in here.

300
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,250
Anything to report?

301
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,791
[FEMALE ROBOT VOICE 3-A]
No abnormalities

302
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,916
have been detected.

303
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,666
[MIKOTO] All right, good.
Keep it up.

304
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,375
[GUARD 3-A] No, huh?
Good enough for me.

305
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,791
I'll just skip the
rest of the patrol.

306
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,625
[GUARD 3-A] Huh?
The alarm? What the hell?

307
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,875
[MIKOTO] How come?

308
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,500
The sensors shouldn't
be able to pick me up!

309
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,208
Did I miss something?

310
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,791
[GUARD 3-A] Keep calm...
What does the manual say?

311
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,458
[MIKOTO] Well,
for now, at least...

312
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,958
[GUARD 3-A] Whoa!
What's wrong with you?

313
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,208
Hey! Come back!

314
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,166
[MIKOTO] What now?

315
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,916
Give up for tonight
and get out of here? No.

316
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,833
It doesn't appear
to be me they found...

317
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,083
and all this confusion
could be my chance...

318
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,333
All right... Keep going!

319
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,208
[GUARD 3-A] Hey!
What the hell is going on?

320
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,375
[GUARD 3-B] Sorry, man!

321
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,916
I totally forgot to tell you...

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,791
We have a visitor
coming in tonight.

323
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,000
[GUARD 3-A] What? It's too loud!

324
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,750
I can't hear you!
Just turn it off!

325
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:34,083
[GUARD 3-A] It finally
stopped. Who's there?!

326
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,333
[MIKOTO] Alright, let's
see what they're hiding.

327
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,083
What are those?

328
00:16:56,083 --> 00:17:00,166
[MIKOTO] Incubators? Each big
enough to hold a person.

329
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,583
[GUARD 3-A] Can I help
you with something?

330
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,750
What are you doing?
You aren't lost, are you?

331
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,166
How exactly did
you get in here?

332
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,458
[GUARD 3-B] Oh...
Never mind about her.

333
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,958
I got word that she
would be coming tonight...

334
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,250
She's here to clear her
data for that project.

335
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,916
You know, that one
they've got frozen.

336
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,375
The idiot
watchman forgot

337
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,250
to give her a staff
card to get around.

338
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,875
You can take care
of this, right?

339
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,750
Just escort the nice young
lady here to the secret base.

340
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,125
Oh, so that's what this
is about. I see now.

341
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,375
[GUARD 3-B] Here...
You need to put this on.

342
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,000
[MIKOTO] There are traces
of quite a few erased files.

343
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,250
I should be able
to restore them.

344
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,041
[MIKOTO] Impossible!

345
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,541
[MIKOTO] "Project Radio Noise...

346
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,541
The goal for this project is to
resolve the genetic sequence

347
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:01,208
that gives rise to a Level 5,
allowing a Level 5 that is born

348
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,208
by chance to then be reproduced

349
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,833
with one hundred
percent certainty...

350
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,041
Further...

351
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,625
...for this project,
it has been decided...

352
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:14,250
...that Railgun... Misaka...
will serve as the model."

353
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:15,791
I mean it!

354
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,041
There's a story going around

355
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,375
about a project designed
to clone Level 5 espers.

356
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,041
Don't act like you
don't remember...

357
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,833
It was just a little while ago.

358
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,500
You were walking in
front of Seventh Mist...

359
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,333
[MIKOTO] It really exists.

360
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:32,000
A project to... to... clone me!

361
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,625
[DOCTOR 2-A]
To create a new Railgun,

362
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,250
we take a fertilized egg and use
a cell that has been extracted

363
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,875
from the original
Railgun's hair follicle.

364
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,458
[DOCTOR 2-A] Prior to
this, of course we obtained

365
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,583
the necessary genetic
sequence pattern sample.

366
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,375
We were then able to
successfully register

367
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,041
her DNA map in
Academy City's databank.

368
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,250
[DOCTOR 2-A] In order
to shorten the time

369
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,458
required to create
a test subject...

370
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,041
we determined that
it was necessary

371
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,458
to curtail the
developmental process...

372
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,958
both physically and emotionally.

373
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,041
[DOCTOR 2-A] To assist with
the development of the body,

374
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:12,666
a cocktail of ZID-02, RIZ-13,
and HEL-03 was administered...

375
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,125
and in roughly fourteen
days we had successfully

376
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:19,000
created a subject that was
physically identical to Railgun.

377
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,083
[DOCTOR 2-A] The development of
the mind and persona was dealt

378
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,375
with under the direction
of external staff member

379
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,000
Nunotaba Shinobu,
who used Testament to install

380
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:30,000
necessary basic
information within the brain.

381
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,666
Once the results
were confirmed...

382
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,500
everything was in order...

383
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,875
Project Radio Noise was set
to move on to the next phase:

384
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,208
The mass-production
of Railgun clones...

385
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,375
also known as Sisters.

386
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,250
[MIKOTO] This is it?

387
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,291
This is what they were after?

388
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,541
[DOCTOR 2-A] It's the
simplest thing in the world.

389
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,750
All you have to do is
give us your DNA map, okay?

390
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,125
[MIKOTO] Stupid girl.

391
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,000
Why did you say
yes to him? If only...

392
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,666
[DOCTOR 2-A] However...

393
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,291
As the project reached
its final stage...

394
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,333
projections were calculated
using Tree Diagram...

395
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,750
The results were not
what we expected.

396
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,750
[MIKOTO] They used Tree Diagram?

397
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,041
But... that's Academy City's
greatest supercomputer...

398
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,291
It hovers in orbit
above the Earth.

399
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,041
[DOCTOR 2-A] Regrettably,
the projections revealed

400
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,875
that the Sisters'
specs were less

401
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,708
than one percent of
the model Railgun's...

402
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,041
On average...

403
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,625
their ratings reached
only as high as Level 2...

404
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,208
And even the most
powerful individuals

405
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,208
did not exceed Level 3.

406
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,583
[MIKOTO] Okay, so...

407
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,291
They were only able to
make less powerful copies...

408
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,583
But even if they mass-produced
a lot of Level 2s...

409
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,375
[DOCTOR 2-A] Regardless
of genetic manipulation

410
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,958
or acquired development...

411
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:42,208
it was impossible to produce
a Level 5 from among the clones.

412
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,708
Thus...

413
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,333
having received Tree
Diagram's computed results...

414
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,958
and to minimize the losses
incurred by this project...

415
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,458
the committee ordered
all of the research

416
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,833
in progress to be
terminated immediately.

417
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,041
The project intended
to mass-produce

418
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:02,166
Railgun "Sisters" was halted
and is frozen in perpetuity.

419
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,625
Okay... I knew it!

420
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,541
Of course there aren't any
clones of me out there...

421
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,833
I'm guessing... word of this
ridiculous project leaked out

422
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,208
some how and the Academy City
rumor mill did the rest.

423
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,000
[MIKOTO] Whew... Even so,
it's a bit freaky...

424
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,500
Imagine, scientists using
my DNA map like that.

425
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:43,791
Well... whatever did
happen, at least it's all over.

426
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,166
Now... I'm heading
home to bed...

427
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,916
I wonder if Kuroko
managed to trick

428
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,666
the Head Resident and
keep me out of trouble.

429
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,500
[GUARD 3-A] Hey...
how much longer

430
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,333
is this procedure gonna take?

431
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,708
[MISAKA 9982] Total
deletion will be complete...

432
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,958
in forty-two point two
eight seconds, says Misaka,

433
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,333
reporting the time
with careful precision.

434
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,750
[MIKOTO] Of course there aren't
any clones of me out there!

435
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,291
Whew, that's a
weight of my chest!

436
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,541
[KUROKO] Sissy,
you really can't afford

437
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,208
to lose any weight
from your chest, you kn--

438
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,791
[MIKOTO] I don't
mean it like that!
