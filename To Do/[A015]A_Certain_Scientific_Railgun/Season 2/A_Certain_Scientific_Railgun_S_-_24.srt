1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,166
[NUNOTABA] Excellent.

2
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,541
It looks adorable on you.

3
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:35,166
Very soon, you'll be
going outside on your own.

4
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,000
[FEBRI] Shinobu?

5
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,250
Remember...

6
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,958
every once in awhile,
suck on one of these.

7
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,291
And now there's...
one last thing.

8
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,500
Mikoto Misaka.

9
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,625
Don't forget that
name, all right?

10
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,791
Mikoto Mi...

11
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,541
[NUNOTABA]
That decision was it...

12
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,750
The beginning of everything.

13
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,458
What happens now?

14
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,708
Have I finally done
something to help...

15
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,166
instead of causing more harm?

16
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:09,916
[MISAKA 10032] Honestly.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,375
She is nothing but trouble.

18
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,416
[ARITOMI] Hmph.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,541
We have some uninvited
party guests, do we?

20
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,791
Poor things...

21
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,000
facing down twenty
thousand powered suits...

22
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,416
I think we can handle one
or two gawky teenagers.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,375
Sorry to keep
you waiting... Hi.

24
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,416
Heh. You know,
you're late.

25
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,333
Hey, guys!

26
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,166
Wha--?! Who are these people?!

27
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,750
You've disrupted the
peace of Academy City.

28
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,958
You've hurt our friend.
An innocent little girl!

29
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,416
[BOTH] This shield is
a symbol of duty.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,208
And that duty...
Is to stop you!

31
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,625
[gasp]

32
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,708
[AOMI] You may have Antiskill
under your control...

33
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,583
But they're not the
only law in this town.

34
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,208
I think today we'll
do this Shirai style.

35
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,416
Huh?

36
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,958
[GROUP]
Judgment is on the scene!

37
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,666
[KUROKO] That's right!

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,833
[MIKOTO laughs]

39
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:11,875
[FEBRI] Mikoto?

40
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,916
[MIKOTO]
Oh, uh... it's nothing.

41
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,958
Okay, guys...
I'm counting on you.

42
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:23,958
[RIOTERS yell]

43
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,125
[KUROKO] By all means,
come and get it...

44
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,375
I am Kuroko Shirai,
Sissy's right-hand gal...

45
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,291
And by my pledge...

46
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,291
None of you shall
set foot past me!

47
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,750
[RIOTER A] You're up!

48
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,250
[AOMI] Tank squads E and F,
come to the left flank...!

49
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,791
Squads J through M,
switch off...! Let's go!

50
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,583
[RIOTERS yell]

51
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,583
[KONORI] Careful now!

52
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,166
Don't forget our
main objective...!

53
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,791
To prevent these things
from leaving the premises!

54
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,791
[SATEN] We're buying time!

55
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,750
Misaka is sure to
come up with something!

56
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,875
I, for one, am glad... that
these machines are running with

57
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,083
simple, easily-controlled
programming.

58
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,125
First, you have to
select a target.

59
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,541
[AWATSUKI] ...then it's all just
a matter of maintaining aggro!

60
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,208
[RIOTER B] Whoa!

61
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,416
[RIOTER C] Awesome!

62
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,541
A water current and
buoyancy control combo!

63
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,916
[AWATSUKI and WANNAI] Hi, Kongo!

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,083
[KONGO] Those are my friends.

65
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,083
Don't you even think
about harming them.

66
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,333
I simply won't allow it!

67
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,791
[SATEN] You're not
gonna get by me!

68
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,500
[UIHARU] Me, either!
We're doing this for Febri...

69
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,416
and also... Because a
good friend asked us to!

70
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,041
[SATEN] This is for Misaka!

71
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,083
[KUROKO] Take that, robot!

72
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,458
I'm kicking it up a notch today!

73
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,500
[RIOTER D] Shirai!

74
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,166
[KUROKO] Because today...

75
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,791
I don't just fight for Judgment.

76
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,875
I fight for Sissy!

77
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,666
They're better
than I had expected.

78
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,000
[SEKIMURA] Yeah,
well... Our attrition rate

79
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,000
is still running at
less than two percent.

80
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,000
[ARITOMI] I want to
know where Railgun is.

81
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,708
Once you do find her...
let Kosako and Madarame loose.

82
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,833
[SEKIMURA] Nunotaba...!

83
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,083
I'm increasing Janie's
operating ratio.

84
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,625
Keep everything regulated!

85
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,458
[NUNOTABA] Why did I do that?

86
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:21,041
Of all names, why did I give
Febri that particular one?

87
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,083
Is it because I believed in her?

88
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,416
Yes...

89
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,458
Maybe that's it...
I just hope... I'm right.

90
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,416
[explosion]

91
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,375
[SEKIMURA] What's that?!

92
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,875
We have an intruder!

93
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,291
Is that...

94
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,333
...Railgun?!

95
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,666
[gasps]

96
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,291
[SEKIMURA] But...
how did she find this place?

97
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,666
[ARITOMI]
Damn that girl.

98
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,291
[ARITOMI over TV]
Hello, Railgun.

99
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,666
Excuse the mess.

100
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,000
I didn't expect company,

101
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,041
but I guess you negotiated
your own invitation.

102
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,916
Shinobu...? Shinobu!

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,333
And now that you're here,
I'm afraid you leave us

104
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,708
little choice. Please
enjoy our hospitality.

105
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,166
[MIKOTO] Just hold on
a little longer...

106
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,208
We'll see her soon enough.

107
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,125
[ARITOMI] All you espers
have one common weakness...

108
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,833
You're only human, which
means you will eventually tire.

109
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,583
And you are no
exception to this rule.

110
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,916
I don't care what
level esper you are...

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,541
When you're this outnumbered...

112
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,375
you don't stand a chance.

113
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, you're right.

114
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,083
If I was all on my own,
this would be difficult.

115
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,250
However...

116
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,250
Things are different this time.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,625
[MIKOTO] All of us...

118
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,250
...are fighting
against you together!

119
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,916
[FEBRI screams]

120
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,625
Incredible...

121
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,708
We have planned
for this situation...

122
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,958
Activate scenario B-7...

123
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,125
Send Kosako and Madrame, now!

124
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,958
[AOMI] Squads A and B,
hang in a little longer...

125
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,041
Espers, Attack...!

126
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,291
Go once again from
the left flank--

127
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,958
[KONGO] Hah!

128
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,000
[KONGO] Okay. Who's next?

129
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,083
What do we
do, you guys?

130
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,500
We can't get through
to the others!

131
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,166
There's no signal!

132
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,583
I expected this.

133
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,791
[UIHARU] I don't
know what to do!

134
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,541
The commands to my
security robots aren't--

135
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,708
Yeah, seriously...

136
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,500
What now?

137
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,250
[KOSAKO] It's time
you learned a lesson.

138
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,958
Intellectual prowess
cannot be neglected...

139
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:02,166
or we will all become helpless
sheep in thrall to the espers.

140
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,791
[MADARAME] It would have
been a lot more satisfying

141
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,583
to have gone up
against Railgun...

142
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,708
Well...

143
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,875
...what are you gonna do?!

144
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:27,458
[panting]

145
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,666
[ARITOMI] You seem to be
getting worn out, Railgun.

146
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,458
Unfortunately for you, this
party is just getting started.

147
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,791
These models are
equipped with weapons made

148
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,791
after analyzing the
city's fourth-ranked esper.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,208
I guess you could call
it our version of Meltdowner.

150
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,416
Enjoy your first-hand look.

151
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,291
[UIHARU screams]

152
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,541
[SATEN] Uiharu?!

153
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,458
No, I'll be all right...

154
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,583
Please, don't worry a--

155
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,083
[SATEN] Behind you!

156
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,291
[YOMIKAWA] Sorry we're late.

157
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,666
Your friend suggested
that I bring this along.

158
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,625
What is it?

159
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,916
[HARU'UE] Let us
take care of contacting

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,333
the other sites, okay?

161
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,583
[UIHARU] It's Haru'ue!

162
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,583
That's right...

163
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,000
and Banri is
helping out, too...

164
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,666
We're making a
network of telepaths.

165
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,208
I thought something
like this might happen...

166
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,458
[AOMI] Thank you for this.

167
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,500
[EDASAKI] Please,
it's no problem!

168
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,333
Being able to help
Judgment out is like

169
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,250
a dream come true for me!

170
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,875
[KONGO] "Always be prepared and
you will never be surprised."

171
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,791
Philosophy in action.

172
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,416
Isn't there a
manual for this?

173
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,166
Yeah, don't worry.
It's in my head.

174
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:52,833
Well, mostly.

175
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,166
Okay then, here goes.

176
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,291
[scared yelling]

177
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:00,000
[KONGO] Allow me to introduce
the variable-form, large-scale,

178
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,833
all-purpose machine built
with the latest technology

179
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:06,416
from Kongo Airlines'
Metalworks Plant Number 2.

180
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,166
[grunts, gasps]

181
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,666
What is that thing?!

182
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,375
What do you think of her?

183
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,291
Ecaterina the Second...!
New and improved!

184
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,166
[HARU'UE] That's
what she calls it!

185
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,333
[SATEN] Whoa...!
Nice choice, Uiharu.

186
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,708
You're fired up today, huh?

187
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,041
[shocked yelp]

188
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,083
[SATEN] Okay! Let's see
if we can do them justice!

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's so fast!

190
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,833
[SATEN] Ready, and...
Knockout punch!!

191
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,708
[UIHARU] Saten, be carefuulll!

192
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,958
Fire!

193
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,791
[MIKOTO] Oh, please!

194
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,333
That's nothing like
the real Meltdowner.

195
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,833
[MADARAME] Damn!
Damn every last esper!

196
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,041
This is a day of revolution!

197
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,750
[UIHARU] I'm taking
over control now, Saten.

198
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,083
[SATEN] Okay!

199
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:02,083
[SATEN] You hate espers? Well,
I'm actually a Level Zeeerooo!

200
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,625
Are you serious...?

201
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,333
That was a poor,
pathetic imitation.

202
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,791
Oh, quit it.

203
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,750
I'm damn sick of
these pieces of junk.

204
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,125
[FRENDA] Whoa...!
Just like our intel said...!

205
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,416
It really is copying Mugino...

206
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,166
That's just plain asking for it.

207
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,666
[KINUHATA] This is an ultra
huge number of powered suits...

208
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,583
What do you think is going on?

209
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,875
Who knows?

210
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,291
[MUGINO] So this is what's
behind all those fool's errands

211
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,333
we've been sent on lately.

212
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,916
Damn it...

213
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,250
You bastards were using us this
whole time to collect data...?!

214
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,083
Screw you!

215
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,750
[FRENDA] Whoo-hoo!

216
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,500
[KINUHATA] Ultra-pretty fire.

217
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,291
[TAKITSUBO] Hey, Mugino...
Over there I sensed--

218
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,666
[MUGINO] Hmph!

219
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,041
We don't have time to waste
on a spoiled little brat

220
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,000
who doesn't want
to learn her lesson.

221
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,708
[FEBRI] Hey...
Those people earlier...

222
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:05,916
[MIKOTO] Oh, those guys...

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,041
It's best to forget
about them... okay?

224
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,708
[MIKOTO] We need to hurry!

225
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,541
[ARITOMI] Madarame!
Kosako...! Do you copy?

226
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,541
[SAKURAI] Not getting
anything from above, either.

227
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,083
[ARITOMI] It's not over!

228
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,166
It isn't over!

229
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,166
We have not been defeated!

230
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,958
[MIKOTO] See, that's
where you're wrong.

231
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,208
[ARITOMI] You!

232
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,916
[MIKOTO] I suggest you
put an end to this...

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,958
and let Janie go this instant.

234
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:30,875
[FEBRI gasps]

235
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,166
[FEBRI] Shinobu!

236
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,291
Hi, Febri...

237
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:37,416
[MIKOTO] Well, I came.
Like I promised.

238
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,333
This disgusts me...

239
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,291
Espers reveling
in their triumph!

240
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,125
Aritomi!
What are you...?

241
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,791
[FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE]
Code input confirmed.

242
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,500
Initiating final phase.

243
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,250
[alarm sounds]

244
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,583
[NUNOTABA]
...Janie!

245
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,041
[KONGO] Huh?

246
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,833
[BOTH] They stopped the attack?

247
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:56,916
[KUROKO] Sissy...

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,541
[SEKIMURA] N-N-N-N-N-No!
Don't, Aritomi!

249
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,958
You can't be
serious about this!

250
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,250
[NUNOTABA] You're setting the
system to a runaway state?

251
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,000
[ARITOMI] If I force
the connection to break,

252
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,416
she will die.

253
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,541
[ARITOMI] This is
the final phase...

254
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,291
also known as the
last possible resort.

255
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,458
I'm going to turn
Academy City into ashes.

256
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:19,666
[MIKOTO] Oh, yeah? And what
exactly are your plans?

257
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,750
Seriously now...

258
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,791
you really think
I would tell you?

259
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,000
[SAKURAI] What are you doing?

260
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,625
There's not much time
left... I hope you're ready.

261
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,458
It-... it's time to die...

262
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,750
[SEKIMURA stammers] Oh, no!

263
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,041
[NUNOTABA] I can't...
It's no use...

264
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,375
What am I going
to do? It's over!

265
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,833
[gunshot]

266
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,458
[MIKOTO] You want to
take the easy way out?

267
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,125
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

268
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,625
You know, there was
somebody I met once...

269
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,416
He had all the power
he could ever need,

270
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,541
but still he
reached out for more.

271
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,958
I also know someone
who was a lot like you...

272
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,250
ashamed of her lack of ability.

273
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,125
She was willing
to do cruel things...

274
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,458
to make up for her
perceived inadequacies.

275
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,500
And then there's this
group of girls I know...

276
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,833
They thought of
themselves as tools.

277
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:28,500
And quietly accepted
an inhumane fate.

278
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,541
And let's not forget
the biggest fool...

279
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,875
The reckless, stubborn girl...

280
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,333
who thought she could
make everything better

281
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,500
by throwing her life away.

282
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,625
Now here I am... I finally
figured it out...

283
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,958
Life isn't about being strong
on your own all the time...

284
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,416
See, I made a promise
to my friends...

285
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,708
That no matter what,
I'd help Febri.

286
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,791
And protect the city.

287
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,583
I'll keep that promise.
Even if it means saving you.

288
00:13:58,875 --> 00:13:59,875
[NUNOTABA] So that's it.

289
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,083
[MIKOTO] Now... what
do we do to abort...

290
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,416
[NUNOTABA] This is why...

291
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,625
[MIKOTO] Answer me!

292
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:08,291
[NUNOTABA] I knew I could...
believe in you.

293
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,791
[ARITOMI] I... I don't think...

294
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,458
[SAKURAI gasps]
It's too late now...!

295
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,333
The final phase
can't be stopped!

296
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,791
The plan involves
scattering

297
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,791
five thousand filaments in
the skies over Academy City

298
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,791
and then running the Diffusion
Ghost ability out of control,

299
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,916
triggering a decay chain
in the AIM diffusion fields

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,041
that fill the area!

301
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,458
[SAKURAI] The launch
mechanism is in some

302
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,833
construction equipment
in stationary orbit

303
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,125
thirty-five thousand
kilometers up.

304
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,041
The missile has
already been launched.

305
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,125
Every second,
it travels seven kilometers

306
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,791
closer to us...

307
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:45,041
So... It cannot be stopped...
Not by anyone...

308
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,541
Certainly not by you!

309
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,708
[MIKOTO] You're right...
I doubt I can stop it.

310
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,708
Not all by myself.

311
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,583
[SATEN] A missile?!

312
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,666
[KUROKO] How can we help...?

313
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,916
[UIHARU] Give me
its specifications...

314
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,041
[FEBRI] It's Ruiko...!

315
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,416
Shinobu, this is Ruiko...

316
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,833
[MIKOTO] Just a sec, okay?

317
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,708
[KONORI] Judgment has its
share of science students.

318
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,625
I'll ask around.

319
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,625
[MIKOTO] Yeah, do that!

320
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,083
[KONGO] I will
help out, as well.

321
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,125
[SATEN] Hey...
Febri is looking flushed.

322
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,750
[MIKOTO] Huh?
Show me your lollipop!

323
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,666
I guess it's all gone.

324
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,000
[KUROKO] Tell me
she has some left!

325
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,250
[MIKOTO] That was the last one!

326
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,583
[SATEN] Oh, no!

327
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,208
[NUNOTABA] Let me handle this.

328
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,000
[NUNOTABA] It isn't a
matter of "can" or "can't."

329
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,250
I will find a way.

330
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,958
I'll do this somehow.

331
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,500
Anything is possible.

332
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,041
Because I know
I'm not in this alone.

333
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,458
[UIHARU] Aghhhh! Man!

334
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,416
[HARU'UE] What's the matter?

335
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,416
[SATEN] Is something wrong?

336
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,583
[UIHARU] Using
Judgment's system,

337
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,458
not only is there no
way to intercept it,

338
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,458
I can't even compute its orbit!

339
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,375
[KONORI] Given the
machine's specs...

340
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,333
[phone "ribbit" rings]

341
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,500
[MISAKA 10032] "I have heard
about what's happening...

342
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,666
It looks like it's
finally my turn,"

343
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,125
says Misaka, announcing her
intentions with superb timing.

344
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,000
[UIHARU] It's an
ingenious design...

345
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,500
When the missile's warhead
reaches thirty thousand meters,

346
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,208
it's set up to then
subdivide into five thousand

347
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,375
micro-warheads.

348
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,458
Once that happens,
it'll be too late.

349
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,875
So it's imperative that
the missile be shot down

350
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,625
before the split occurs.

351
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,333
[UIHARU] And the only way
that can possibly be done...

352
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,333
[footsteps, panting]

353
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,708
I made it! I'm here!

354
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,333
[FEBRI] Lollipop?

355
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,666
[NUNOTABA] Thank goodness.
This'll buy us a little time.

356
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,458
[SATEN] They were exactly
where that Aritomi man

357
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,666
said they would be. What now?

358
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,958
First, we need to free Janie

359
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,250
from the runaway system,
and to do that...

360
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,541
We're going to
need Febri's help.

361
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,583
Right now, she's in a state
where she will accept

362
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,458
no outside input...

363
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,583
but if we can get a strong
emotional response from Febri,

364
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,166
who is basically
identical to her...

365
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,458
[SATEN] That makes sense...
Because when all else fails,

366
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,250
love can still
get through, right?

367
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,375
Huh...? Uh...
okay... Yeah.

368
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,375
[UIHARU] It took some doing,
but I had Kongo rig the airframe

369
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,750
so that all eight thousand
and ninety-two jet points

370
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,000
will activate to a precision of
one one-thousandth of a second.

371
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,250
Theoretically,
This should work out... but...

372
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,541
How did you get such
a complex calculation

373
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,541
done in so short a time?

374
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,416
Oh, well... you know...

375
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,833
[buttons being pressed]

376
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,875
[MIKOTO] Sorry, Kuroko.

377
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,250
I never had
any intention

378
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,250
of dragging
you into this.

379
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,125
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

380
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,708
I'm really glad... There's
nothing that could make me

381
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,583
prouder than having you
rely on me to assist you.

382
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,083
Your confidence
means the world to me.

383
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,291
[MIKOTO] Thank you.

384
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,958
[NUNOTABA] They're in synch.
Okay, Febri's up.

385
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,166
[SATEN] Got it...

386
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,208
[FEBRI gasps]

387
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,958
Big Sister, it's Febri...!
and this guy here

388
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:06,958
is Gekota...

389
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,416
He's a really good
friend of mine.

390
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,208
You know what...?

391
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,625
I've been outside...

392
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,125
[NUNOTABA] Please work...

393
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:16,041
I know I'm asking for more
than I deserve at this point.

394
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,625
If not for me... for them...

395
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,750
Let Febri's emotions
get through to her sister!

396
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,208
[NUNOTABA] This processing
speed can't keep up!

397
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,583
[beep]

398
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,416
[NUNOTABA] What's that...?
Access from outside?!

399
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,541
[MISAKA 10032] "I will
give you a hand, okay?"

400
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,416
Asks Misaka, retroactively
seeking approval after

401
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,458
having already acted.

402
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,125
Why would you do this?

403
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,000
[MISAKA 19090] To say thanks
for the fragments of our mind

404
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,208
we received from you.

405
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,666
Your mind...? I...

406
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,166
[MISAKA 19090] By the way...

407
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,833
This Misaka's serial number
is one nine zero nine zero.

408
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,166
[NUNOTABA] Wait, do you
mean... What I did before...

409
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,916
it reached you?

410
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,916
That's right...
and, moreover...

411
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,750
[MISAKA 10032] ...those
two young girls have

412
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,875
a thought base program that
is identical to the Misakas'.

413
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,708
Which means they are
basically like family

414
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,708
to the Misaka sisters...
"Does an older sister really

415
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,958
need a reason to help out
her younger sister?"

416
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:21,125
asks Misaka, adopting a tone of
wisdom and sisterly affection.

417
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,083
[MISAKA 19090] Like those
girls, we, too, want to know...

418
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,291
[MISAKA 19090] ...how bright and
beautiful the world can be...

419
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,708
...when you are not alone.

420
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,750
Good morning,
Big Sister!

421
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,750
[FEBRI] Shinobu!
Big Sister finally woke up!

422
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,166
She did...

423
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:30,291
[NUNOTABA] Good
morning... Janie.

424
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,500
[SATEN] Go on now,
Febri...

425
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,166
You have something to
give her, don't you?

426
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,833
Oh! Here!

427
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,333
[FEBRI] Take it! It's for Big
Sister and for you, Shinobu...!

428
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,375
Do you like it?
I made it myself!

429
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,083
You made something... for me?

430
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,416
What's the matter?

431
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,666
Oh, it's nothing...
There's just so much to do...

432
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,458
So many beautiful
things I want to show you.

433
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,291
[SATEN sobs] I can't take it...!

434
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,333
it's just, she's
growing up so quickly!

435
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,708
Come on,
Saten, stop...!

436
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,500
You promised that
you wouldn't cry,

437
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,916
and now you're
gonna make me...

438
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,125
[FEBRI] Ruiko, Whee-ha,
don't cry. It'll be okay.

439
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,166
Here, Janie. I brought
this for you...

440
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,333
It's a good luck charm...
Keep it with you.

441
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,416
I promise, it's
quite effective.

442
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,375
Guess that's it, then...
So they'll be going to

443
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,208
a facility overseas to be
examined and reconditioned?

444
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,458
That's too bad...

445
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,875
now that we've all
become such good friends.

446
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,166
It's difficult to
believe how well

447
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,541
everything turned out.

448
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,958
Almost like the bad parts
never happened at all...

449
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,958
as if the record of events had
been completely rewritten.

450
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,708
Oh... Really?

451
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,750
Electronic records
can be so...

452
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,750
Well... unreliable,
would you say...? Anyhow...

453
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,916
I get the feeling that some
of the human memories

454
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,125
have been doctored, as well.

455
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,333
[MIKOTO] Oh, um, yeah...

456
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,291
Well... if you're willing to
put differences behind you,

457
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:32,000
swallow your pride, and reach
out... the results can be...

458
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,333
...Impressive...

459
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,916
[NUNOTABA] I guess
it's my turn now, huh?

460
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,875
It'll be okay...
I know I can do this.

461
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,208
After all...
I'm not alone anymore.

462
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,333
You're ready?

463
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,416
Yes.

464
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,791
[MIKOTO stretches]

465
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,041
Okay... should we get going?

466
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,291
[UIHARU] If we leave
now we'll be in time

467
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,125
for the afternoon lectures.

468
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,583
[KUROKO] Yeah, you're right.

469
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,000
[SATEN] I think I'll
stop for lunch somewhere.

470
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,541
[MIKOTO] Man, this city...

471
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,750
There's never
a dull moment, huh?

472
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,500
[ALL] Not when
you're around, Misaka!

473
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,458
[MIKOTO] Hey, hold on...!
What's that supposed to mean?!

474
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,875
[UIHARU] So... is
everybody ready for

475
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,458
the regional field trip?

476
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,041
[KUROKO] Is it
that time already?

477
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,958
[SATEN] Liberal Arts City,
huh...? I can't wait!

478
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,250
[MIKOTO] Wait, come on...!

479
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,416
Seriously, guys...!
What did you mean by that?
