1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,666
[gunfire and explosions]

2
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,666
[clattering]

3
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,916
[FRENDA] So, all told.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,333
What was our assignment
this time, anyway?

5
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,208
[KINUHATA] Yeah.

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,875
That's an ultra-good question.

7
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,916
Well, we were supposed
to come down here

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,083
and put a stop to an arms deal.

9
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,833
Of course, we get here, and
there's no arms deal in sight

10
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,375
and instead, one of these
toys starts attacking us.

11
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,125
You look funny.
What's the deal?

12
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,000
I dunno.
I have this feeling.

13
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,583
[clattering]

14
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,833
[FRENDA] Mugino!

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,166
Thank you for that.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,833
Ultra happy to
be of service.

17
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,208
[FRENDA] Geez, don't startle
me like that, okay?

18
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,041
Thank you, Mugin--

19
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,208
[MUGINO] Tch.

20
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,041
[ARITOMI] I'd say those are
adequate enough results

21
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,916
for a field test.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,125
We are steadily gathering
data for the real thing-

23
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:18,916
[KOSAKO] Aritomi.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,875
Huh?

25
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,791
[sirens in distance]

26
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,375
[UIHARU] Oh, man.
I've got a tummy ache!

27
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,583
That was an exotic stew.
I've never eaten turtle before.

28
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,208
[UIHARU] The beef Misaka
brought was amazing, too.

29
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,250
And because of that,
I am now way too full!

30
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,708
Maybe we should find
some medicine for you.

31
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,125
[UIHARU groans]

32
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,291
Oh, by the way.

33
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,375
Did that talk you had with
your teacher go all right?

34
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,041
[HARU'UE] Yeah. It did.

35
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,416
I think we found
the perfect spot.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
[UIHARU] You did, huh?

37
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,708
Then it's almost time.

38
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,333
[HARU'UE] Mm.

39
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,375
[both chuckle]

40
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,208
[SATEN] So?

41
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,708
Who's that you
were talking to?

42
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,875
[MIKOTO] Hm?

43
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,041
[SATEN] That fine
young man back there.

44
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,666
Oh, just
somebody I know.

45
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,250
So evasive!

46
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,083
Ooh! It was cookie
boy, wasn't it?

47
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,291
No, it wasn't!

48
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,333
I swear, that's the last
time I bake anything!

49
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,708
[SATEN] Okay, fine,

50
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,541
if that wasn't him,
who is the cookie guy?

51
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,958
[MIKOTO] I-I'm telling you he-

52
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,375
[KUROKO] Hello, Sissy.

53
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,666
You're getting here late.
What have you been up to?

54
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,916
Ooh, I'll
tell you-

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,125
[MIKOTO] Ah! Hey,
look, the elevator's here!

56
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:04,208
Come on, come on, let's go!
Quickly now, everybody! Heh.

57
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,958
[SATEN] There she
goes! So adorable!

58
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,958
[MIKOTO] Congratulations,
Edasaki.

59
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,375
[EDASAKI] Huh?

60
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,500
We hear you're being
discharged. Right?

61
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:18,125
Heh, yeah I am!
I owe it all to you guys.

62
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,291
Having that uniform waiting
for me really inspired me

63
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,333
to work hard and finish
my rehabilitation

64
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,666
before summer was over!

65
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,041
[MIKOTO] So, is everything set
for when you get out of here?

66
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,625
[EDASAKI] Mm-Hmm.

67
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,083
[UIHARU] Actually, Edasaki is
going to be living with Haru'ue.

68
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,458
Oh. Really?

69
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,958
Yep.

70
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,750
[EDASAKI] Well, you know.
I've been in a home for so long.

71
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,708
[UIHARU] Suddenly living on
her own would be really hard.

72
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,208
I talked to my teachers
about the situation,

73
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:51,500
and they agreed that Banri
and I could share a place.

74
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,750
Oh, that's nice.

75
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,125
So then, you'll be
moving again, huh?

76
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,333
We'd be happy to come by
and help you guys out.

77
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,291
[HARU'UE] That's okay,
thanks though.

78
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,750
Uiharu and I already
took care of it.

79
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,708
[SATEN] Seriously?

80
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,291
[UIHARU] Yep.

81
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,333
We made a few calls and got the
movers lined up for tomorrow.

82
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,833
[MIKOTO] Well, that was quick.

83
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,208
[KUROKO] You could
have at least asked us.

84
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,166
[UIHARU] Haru'ue said
there's still some stuff

85
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,291
she and Edasaki needed
to talk about.

86
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,500
[MIKOTO] Oh, okay.

87
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,708
Really, Uiharu, if you'd
just said something,

88
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,791
we totally would have
helped out on moving day.

89
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,041
Don't worry about it.

90
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,041
It's honestly not
that big a deal.

91
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,958
Though the whole
place is overflowing

92
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,791
with cardboard
boxes right now.

93
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,375
Yeah, I can imagine.

94
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,333
I remember what it was like when
Haru'ue first moved in with you.

95
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,708
There's even more now
than there was then.

96
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,458
Which is strange since she
didn't actually live there

97
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,958
for that long.

98
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,458
[UIHARU] Oh, I forgot!

99
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,791
[GROUP] Huh?

100
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,875
We have to go.

101
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,666
It's about time,
isn't it, Shirai?

102
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,166
Oh. Yeah,
you're right. It is.

103
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,666
What? You guys have some
kinda' Judgment work to do?

104
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,875
Yeah. We've been
asked to do security

105
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,000
for the upcoming
Academic Reach Assembly.

106
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,000
Today's the
preliminary inspection.

107
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh.

108
00:05:59,083 --> 00:05:59,875
[SATEN] Sorry.

109
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,208
[GROUP] Hm?

110
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,500
I don't really understand
what a school assembly

111
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,875
would need security for.

112
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:04,958
[MIKOTO] Uh?

113
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,666
Oh! I can see why
you were confused.

114
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,833
Shirai wasn't using
its full name,

115
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,166
the Academy City
Research Forum Assembly.

116
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,333
It's called "Academic
Reach" for short.

117
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,500
[KUROKO] Academy City's
students are dedicated

118
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,875
to research and study.

119
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,083
Those with outstanding
grades are given a setting

120
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,500
in which they can share
their work with others.

121
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,791
That's what the Academy City
Research Forum Assembly is.

122
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,333
Qualification for the forum
is based on the strength

123
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,708
of students' academic work,

124
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,500
rather than the strength
of their abilities.

125
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,541
Oh, I see.

126
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,083
Well, that sounds kinda fun.

127
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,083
It's like a festival
for smart people.

128
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,791
Maybe not quite as
fun as a festival.

129
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,125
There are professional
quality presentations,

130
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,416
great lectures, and all
sorts of other stuff.

131
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,791
Yeah?

132
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,833
I don't really get it,
but I guess it sounds cool.

133
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,458
I wonder why they picked this
year to start doing this thing.

134
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,291
[GROUP] Eh--

135
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,750
Uh, Saten.

136
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,291
They actually do it every year.

137
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,666
[SATEN] Seriously?

138
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,833
[AWATSUKI] Wow!

139
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,291
You mean you're really
going to help us?

140
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,125
[WANNAI] It's a request from
a member of the swim club.

141
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,375
Since you're not in the club,
you certainly don't have to-

142
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,125
Oh, nonsense. Don't be silly.

143
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,500
Club member or not,
you two are my friends,

144
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,458
so I would be happy
to assist you.

145
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,916
Besides, I'm still relatively
new to the area, you know.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,541
So I've never seen an Academic
Reach Assembly before.

147
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,750
[WOMAN 18-A yells]

148
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,875
[KONGO] This would be
a perfect opportu--

149
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,625
[WANNAI] Kongo!
Are you all right?

150
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,083
You ruffian!

151
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,083
You dare to assault
Mitsuko Kongo?

152
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,916
[WOMAN 18-A] Somebody,
please help!

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,333
That man took my bag!

154
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,416
[KONGO gasps]

155
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,666
[THIEF 18-A yells]

156
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,666
[crashing sound]

157
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,250
It is the height of stupidity

158
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,041
to perpetrate such
a brazen theft

159
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,333
in broad daylight
on a busy street!

160
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,083
You're a moron
and a criminal.

161
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,875
And I will not allow you to
roam the streets any longer.

162
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,125
You're done.

163
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,125
Mitsuko Kongo has spoken!

164
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,875
[WANNAI] Kongo always
comes through.

165
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,041
She is
so amazing!

166
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,666
[KONGO] Now to dispose of him.

167
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,000
Wannai, there is an Antiskill
station just around the corner.

168
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,458
Would you please alert them?

169
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,958
Yes, right away!

170
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,708
[AWATSUKI chuckles]

171
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,250
A good day's work.

172
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,375
[ARITOMI] Excuse me.

173
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,708
Do you have a moment?

174
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,708
I saw this little
scene play out.

175
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,583
Don't you think you
went a bit too far?

176
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,625
[KONGO] What?

177
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,083
It doesn't matter
whether this man

178
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,250
is a purse-snatching
miscreant or not.

179
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,333
I don't think you should
be using your ability

180
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,500
so recklessly.

181
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,708
Oh? And who are you to say--

182
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,041
There were a number of ways

183
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,416
that you could
have handled this.

184
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,958
And any one of them
would have been better.

185
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,833
Like you told
those other girls.

186
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,875
There's an Antiskill booth
not far away from here,

187
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,958
and don't forget
the security cameras.

188
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:33,958
What exactly
are you--

189
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,625
If I may continue.

190
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,708
Did you not even stop
for a moment to think

191
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,083
how much danger you were
exposing everybody here to?

192
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,333
Huh?

193
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,916
[ARITOMI] You didn't
notice this, did you?

194
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,833
Fortunately for us, you were
able to incapacitate him

195
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,291
with one shot this time.

196
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,083
Can you begin to
imagine the results

197
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,250
if you had failed to do so?

198
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,916
The thief would
have been furious.

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,666
He may even have taken
a woman or child hostage.

200
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,958
[MALE ONLOOKER 18-A] Ya' know,
he's right about that!

201
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,458
[MALE ONLOOKER 18-B] That
would've been awful.

202
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,833
[MALE ONLOOKER 18-C] Those
abilities aren't foolproof.

203
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,666
[ARITOMI] You seem to be
quite confident of yourself

204
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,791
and your power.

205
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,916
But an ability isn't
always the answer.

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,500
I didn't mean to.

207
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,375
[WANNAI] Hold on a minute!

208
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,250
I don't know who you
are or why you're here.

209
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,958
But there's no reason
to be so hard on her.

210
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,500
Whether you
approve or not,

211
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,250
the fact remains that she did
safely secure the criminal.

212
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,958
[KONGO] Ladies, you're back.

213
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,166
[WANNAI] I'm really
sorry we took so long.

214
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,916
The Antiskill officers are
on their way down here now.

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,833
Oh. That's good,
thank you.

216
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:30,958
He's gone.

217
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,166
I wonder where he
could've run off to.

218
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,166
What a strange man.

219
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,166
[door opens]

220
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,958
[KUROKO] Hey Sissy, I'm home.

221
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:38,750
[MIKOTO] Hey.

222
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,083
You were gone for a while.

223
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,166
[KUROKO] Ugh...

224
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,666
What's up?
You seem exhausted.

225
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,083
[KUROKO] The preliminary
Reach inspection.

226
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,833
I knew the forum was
being held across

227
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,208
several different
universities, but still.

228
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,416
I didn't expect to
have to walk that much.

229
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,458
I think my feet
might fall off.

230
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,416
Judgment's a pretty
tough gig, huh?

231
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,833
[KUROKO weakly] Mm-hmm.

232
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,625
[MIKOTO] Uiharu was
with you, right?

233
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,208
How is she doing?

234
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,208
[KUROKO] The same
as she always is.

235
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,000
She carried out her
duties admirably.

236
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,250
[MIKOTO] That's good.

237
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,041
With the move and everything.

238
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,958
Moving can be hard, you know.

239
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,500
I mean, remember how
big of a mess it was

240
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,833
when you first moved in here?

241
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,375
Are you really bringing up
that whole thing again?

242
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,791
The statute of limitations.

243
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,708
[MIKOTO chuckles]

244
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,583
What's up, Sissy?

245
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,250
Thinking about
old times.

246
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,875
Pretty crazy, huh?

247
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,458
Ah!
Well... yeah.

248
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,791
Hmm... I know!

249
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,500
Since you're so exhausted,
I could give you a massage.

250
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,166
[MIKOTO echoing] I could
give you a massage.

251
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,458
I could give you a massage.
I could give you a massage.

252
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,041
Kuroko?

253
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:48,750
[KUROKO yells]

254
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,375
Whoa!
What the...

255
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,708
Well, I just.

256
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,625
I thought I would
take a shower first.

257
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,916
Right.

258
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,708
[SATEN] Ui-ha-ru!

259
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,333
[UIHARU yells]

260
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,708
C'mon, Saten, is that
absolutely necessary?

261
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,708
'Kay, I'm sorry.

262
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,708
[UIHARU] Were you waiting
for me or something?

263
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,500
[SATEN] What? Oh, no.

264
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,875
I was just in the area, so.

265
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,666
I really am fine.
I promise.

266
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,041
Haru'ue and I have been
discussing the situation

267
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,583
for a while now.

268
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,208
And we both agreed that when
Edasaki got out of the hospital,

269
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,375
it would be best if the two
of them lived together.

270
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,250
Aw, really?

271
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,833
Really. Of course,
I'd be lying if I said

272
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,166
I wasn't going
to miss Haru'ue.

273
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,583
Still. I think this is good.

274
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,833
They're close.

275
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,833
And they've been through
so much together.

276
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,666
Besides, it's not like she's
moving far away or anything.

277
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,166
And once the
new term starts,

278
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,666
we'll still see each other
at school every day.

279
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,250
Oh, yeah. You will, huh?

280
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,125
Good, then I guess I can stop
worrying about you so much.

281
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,791
[UIHARU] Yeah. Now please
let go of my hair!

282
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,125
[SATEN] You're gonna
be all right.

283
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,541
[UIHARU chuckles]

284
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,291
[UIHARU] Yes.

285
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,458
[EDASAKI] Well, here I am!

286
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,791
So, how is it?

287
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,541
Perfect! It's totally cute!

288
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,833
It looks
fantastic on you!

289
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,083
Aw, thank you!

290
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,583
Oh! So before, when
you guys stayed behind

291
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,250
at the hospital to talk, this
is what you were talking about.

292
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,375
[HARU'UE] Mm-Hmm.

293
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,625
I couldn't wait to...

294
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,250
[KUROKO whispering]
Go on, Sissy, you're up.

295
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,083
[MIKOTO] Oh, right.
Here goes!

296
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,708
For you, Edasaki.
To say "congratulations."

297
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,333
--Thank you!
--[GROUP] Congratulations!

298
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,791
Thanks so much!

299
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,791
So, are we ready
to get going?

300
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,416
[EDASAKI] Huh?
Where to?

301
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,291
A little
celebration for you!

302
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,250
The place we reserved a
table at has amazing cakes!

303
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,375
[phone rings]

304
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,458
We get cake! That
would be wonderful!

305
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,916
Hello, yes,
this is Shirai.

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,625
Oh, hi Konori.

307
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,000
Eh? Traffic
signal trouble?

308
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,916
Huh? Hey don't
give me that look!

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,833
I didn't do it!

310
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,375
[car horns honking]

311
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,875
[KONORI] The signals in this
area are down across the board.

312
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,791
I'm sorry to ask,
but I need you now.

313
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,333
[KUROKO] Yes. Right.

314
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,125
On my way as we speak.

315
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,958
Um. Uiharu's
needed, too?

316
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:19,541
Of course I--

317
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,416
No. You can't go.

318
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,916
Edasaki is just getting
released from the hospital.

319
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,625
I can cover this.
You stay here-

320
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,041
[UIHARU] What are
you talking about?

321
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,750
I am a member of Judgment.

322
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,500
Please, start without us.

323
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,875
We'll be there as soon
as we're done with this.

324
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,250
We'll see you later, then.

325
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,583
Good luck with
those stoplights.

326
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,291
[UIHARU] Thanks.

327
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,208
C'mon, let's go, Shirai.

328
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,250
Huh? Oh, right.
Well, then.

329
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,458
[EDASAKI gasps] They're gone!

330
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,333
[MIKOTO chuckles]

331
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,125
Okay. We should get going, too.

332
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:54,875
[MIKOTO] It's not exactly how
we planned it, but once again.

333
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,000
[GROUP]
Congratulations, Edasaki!

334
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,458
Thank you so much!

335
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,083
That's delicious!

336
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,166
Isn't it?

337
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,875
Uiharu said if we
were celebrating,

338
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,625
it absolutely
had to be here,

339
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,666
and she handled everything from
the reservations to the cake!

340
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,625
Uiharu really is
something else, isn't she?

341
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,625
[SATEN] Huh?

342
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,666
[EDASAKI]
Before I was discharged,

343
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,250
she came to help me get moved

344
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,125
and take care of
my school admission.

345
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,041
Didn't she?

346
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,125
[HARU'UE] Hm.

347
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,041
[SATEN] Yeah?
That was nice of her.

348
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,416
Very nice!

349
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,125
I wonder if all Judgment
officers are kind like her.

350
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,125
[MIKOTO] I'm glad we let
Uiharu pick this place.

351
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,333
It's like she knew how
much you would enjoy it.

352
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,750
[SATEN] I know, right?

353
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,625
[EDASAKI] This might be
the best cake I've ever had!

354
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,666
[SATEN] Is that the key
to your new place?

355
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,041
[HARU'UE] Mm-Hm.

356
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,375
Uiharu has been pretty
helpful with all this, huh?

357
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,958
[HARU'UE] She was like this
when it was my turn, too.

358
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,750
You mean, when the two of
you were moving in together?

359
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:04,333
Yeah, that sounds like her.
Always the enthusiastic helper.

360
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:10,583
[HARU'UE] I was so nervous then,
but Uiharu was there for me.

361
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:15,041
So now, it's my turn to help
somebody else who needs it.

362
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,958
I'll be there to help
Banri however I can,

363
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,708
just like Uiharu
was there for me.

364
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,750
Of course.

365
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,250
[both giggle]

366
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,916
[SATEN] Well, I just hope
she gets here soon.

367
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,083
[HARU'UE] I'm sure she's
giving it her all at work,

368
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,875
even as we speak.

369
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,458
[SATEN] Yeah, wearing
an ugly helmet

370
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,958
and directing traffic or
something, probably.

371
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,250
She could stand to ease up
at a time like this, though.

372
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,375
[HARU'UE] But not being able
to is what makes her, her.

373
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,750
[SATEN] You're right.

374
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,958
[EDASAKI] Maybe I should
become a member of Judgment.

375
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:47,875
[MIKOTO] Huh?

376
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,750
Where'd that idea come from?

377
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,083
It's just a thought.

378
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,666
If I did join, maybe I
would be more like Uiharu.

379
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,041
[MIKOTO] Heh.

380
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,541
You know, Edasaki.

381
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,916
I don't actually think that
she was being nice to you

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,708
just because she's
a member of Judgment.

383
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,208
Really? Then why?

384
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,750
Because she's your
friend. Silly.

385
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,750
[EDASAKI chuckles]

386
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,958
Yeah, you're right.

387
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,333
[MIKOTO] Ah, free
from the hospital!

388
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,083
[EDASAKI] Huh?

389
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,333
Oh, nothing.

390
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,375
I know somebody else who
was in there recently.

391
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,166
I was just wondering
what it would've been like

392
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,916
for us to celebrate together
like this when they got out.

393
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,333
You know?

394
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,166
[EDASAKI] Uhh...

395
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,083
[MIKOTO] Oh, sorry!
Now I'm being silly.

396
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,458
Please forget I said
anything! Really!

397
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,791
Well, whoever your friend is,

398
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,708
I hope they're feeling
a lot better.

399
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah. So do I.

400
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,791
[KONORI] Good work today.

401
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,166
Sorry I had to call you
out of the blue like that.

402
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,833
[KUROKO] Stoplight trouble,
of all things.

403
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,291
I was kinda' surprised.

404
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,875
There was some irregularity
in the electrical system.

405
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,500
But in Academy City?

406
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,875
It's unusual for things like
that to happen here, you know.

407
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,375
[UIHARU] There you are!

408
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, Uiharu,
that's right.

409
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,916
Well, if we're all done
here, we'll have to be--

410
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,791
Geez, what's
gotten into you?

411
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,041
Hurry, there's someplace
I need you to take me!

412
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,125
Yes. Calm down, I
know. Let's head ba--

413
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,500
No, not there!

414
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,500
I want you to take us
somewhere else before that.

415
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,333
Huh?

416
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,833
[MIKOTO] Umm...

417
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,458
What do you think?
Should we call them?

418
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,166
[SATEN] That might
be a good idea.

419
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,333
Uh... Yeah. I'm calling
them right now.

420
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,458
[UIHARU] Hey, sorry to...
keep you waiting.

421
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,541
Uh, me too.

422
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,208
[MIKOTO] Well,
at least you made it!

423
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,041
[SATEN] Geez, it took
you long enough.

424
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,416
Edasaki had to stop by the
hospital, so she already left.

425
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,250
Oh! Really? She did?
Shoot! I'm so sorry!

426
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,708
Don't worry about it.

427
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,791
She wanted me to
tell you thanks.

428
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,791
She had fun.

429
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,458
[UIHARU] Um, here.

430
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,916
These are for you
and Edasaki to share.

431
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,208
[HARU'UE] Huh?

432
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,791
Are those
little cakes?

433
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,375
[SATEN] Oh, the
thing is, Uiharu.

434
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,125
We actually already had
cake while you were gone.

435
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,916
[UIHARU] Well. yes,
I know that, but--

436
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,958
[SATEN] Having cake
after cake is sorta...

437
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,541
[UIHARU] No, you don't understa-

438
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,583
[KUROKO] See, it's like
I was trying to tell you-

439
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,708
[MIKOTO] Hey, now. It's really
the thought that coun--

440
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,958
Listen, you guys-

441
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,083
[HARU'UE] They look just
like they did before!

442
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,416
[GROUP] Huh?

443
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
[HARU'UE] You see, these
are the same little cakes

444
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,791
Uiharu bought me once

445
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,666
when I was nervous to
make me feel better.

446
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,708
They were
so delicious.

447
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,666
[UIHARU] What's the
matter, Haru'ue?

448
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,041
[HARU'UE] I'm hopeless!

449
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,166
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry today!

450
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,250
Um, well.

451
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,541
[HARU'UE] Uiharu.

452
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,791
I want to be like you.
So kind and considerate.

453
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,500
I want to help Banri
like you helped me.

454
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,958
[HARU'UE sobs]

455
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,291
[UIHARU] It'll be all right.
You'll do fine, Haru'ue.

456
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,458
I know it. You can do this.

457
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,583
Thank you so much!

458
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,541
[HARU'UE sobs]

459
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,750
Now, now, calm down.

460
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,250
It's okay.

461
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,708
There's no reason to cry.

462
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,666
I mean...

463
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,750
[UIHARU sobs]

464
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,000
And now there bawling
like little babies.

465
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,875
Whatcha gonna
do, huh?

466
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,833
It's so
sweet.

467
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:19,958
[MIKOTO chuckles]

468
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,750
[UIHARU] Hey, you know.

469
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,916
I wonder how much of a help
I actually was to Haru'ue.

470
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,291
Oh, don't be silly.

471
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,666
I think it's obvious that
you were a big help.

472
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,666
[UIHARU] Ow!

473
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,791
And not just to
Haru'ue, either.

474
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,208
Edasaki, too.

475
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,000
I think you made a real
difference in both their lives.

476
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,666
Thanks, Misaka.

477
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,375
Yeah, and you know, Sissy,

478
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,166
you make a real
difference in my li--Ahh!

479
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,708
[MIKOTO] Well, let's head home!

480
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,083
[SATEN] Oh, I forgot.

481
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,625
I know of a shortcut up ahead.

482
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,208
[MIKOTO] Um, are you sure
this is the right way?

483
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,500
Don't worry, okay?
We just cut through here,

484
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,333
and we'll be on the
main road in no time.

485
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,750
[MIKOTO] How many of these
shortcuts do you know about?

486
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,458
[KUROKO] What is it?
Is something wrong, Sissy?

487
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,708
What is that
down there?

488
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,208
[GROUP] Huh?

489
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,541
[KUROKO] Hey, that looks like...

490
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,583
...a little girl?

491
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,250
[MIKOTO] Huh?

492
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,458
[SATEN] Wow!

493
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,208
She's adorable!

494
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,208
Don't just stand
there staring at her!

495
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,458
[MIKOTO] Hey, hold up, Kuroko!

496
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,875
[UIHARU] She's opening her eyes.

497
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,625
Hi, sleepy head.

498
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,333
Why were you taking
a nap in the park?

499
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,458
If you tell us your name,
maybe we can help you.

500
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Okay. Well,
how old are you?

501
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,166
Can you tell us
where you live?

502
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,250
Your school?

503
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:59,458
Your homeroom teacher's
name, maybe?

504
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,458
This doesn't seem
to be working.

505
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,583
Maybe she speaks a
different language?

506
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,125
You guys are doing
it wrong. Let me try.

507
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,208
When you're trying to
talk to a little girl,

508
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,666
you need to get down to
her eye level, like this.

509
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,500
Oh! That looks like
some tasty candy!

510
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,166
Let's make a trade, okay?

511
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,083
My name is Ruiko.
Now it's your turn.

512
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,416
Do you think you can
tell me your name?

513
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,208
I'm Febri.

514
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,458
[GROUP] Aww...

515
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,500
[SATEN] That's a
very pretty name!

516
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,250
Okay, then, Febri.
What else can you tell us?

517
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,000
Anything goes. You can
just pick something.

518
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,625
[FEBRI] Mikoto Misaka.

519
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,291
[GROUP] Huh?

520
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,583
[MIKOTO] Huh? What?

521
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,458
[ARITOMI] The experiment
was successful.

522
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,041
It was conducted to obtain data

523
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,833
regarding the
fourth-ranked Level 5,

524
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,875
and the numbers came out
more or less as predicted.

525
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,833
We ran into some unexpected
complications on site,

526
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:32,250
but those ought to be
resolved before much longer.

527
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,791
Everything is ready now.

528
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,583
The time has come to
demonstrate our power.

529
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:40,333
We'll show this town of esper
supremacists what we can do.

530
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,291
Those in favor of moving to
the next phase of the project,

531
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,583
please raise your hands.

532
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,666
[MIKOTO] I want to know what the
story is with this Febri girl.

533
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,708
Why does she know my name?

534
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,708
[UIHARU] Maybe she's lost.

535
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,166
[SATEN] What should we do?

536
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,750
[KUROKO] We will decide at
the Academic Reach Assembly.

537
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,416
[MIKOTO, UIHARU, and SATEN]
The Reach Assembly?
