349
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,291
But it-it's my house.

350
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,583
I...

351
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,458
Conny.

352
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,208
Cadets, fall back!

353
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,708
[FEMALE SOLDIER 26B]
I'll scout out the area!

354
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,416
What the hell? This is new.

355
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,333
Can it move?

356
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,125
[FEMALE SOLDIER 26B]
Not with those legs.

357
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,416
[GELGAR]
But... then...

358
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,416
I don't understand.

359
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,375
How did it even get here?

360
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:32,041
♪ Closing Song ♪

361
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,333
[NARRATOR] "My family
got out of harm's way."

362
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,916
So Conny tells himself
to shake off the terror

363
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,708
of what he's seen.

364
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,708
Again, he puts home behind him.

365
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:11,333
Battle erupts across the land.

366
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,333
The Titans remain a mystery.

367
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:17,250
As the situation goes
from bad to worse,

368
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,708
Eren and the others
head for Ehrmich District

369
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,583
hoping to find
some shred of the truth.
