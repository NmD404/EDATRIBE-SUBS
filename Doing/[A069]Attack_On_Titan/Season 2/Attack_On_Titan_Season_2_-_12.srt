possessed you to come back?

183
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,708
Uh. Can't say, really.

184
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,041
Probably wasn't
the smartest thing.

185
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,000
Seemed a little unfair
to send you guys home

186
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:30,708
empty-handed. Just, think of
me as a consolation prize.

187
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,291
Are you serious?

188
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,375
[YMIR] Look at it this way,
if you hadn't come

189
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,250
to bust up the wall,

190
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,791
who knows when my
nightmare would've ended?

191
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,708
I owed quite a debt.

192
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:48,541
This is me giving back
what I took from you.

193
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,458
'Least somebody knows
the shit you've been through.

194
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,083
Even if it is only me.

195
00:16:55,416 --> 00:17:01,458
Yeah, well...
thank you. Sorry.

196
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,541
No worries.

197
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:11,000
Being a goddess had
its perks while it lasted.

198
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,916
[NARRATOR] With reports
maintaining the likelihood

199
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,666
of Wall Rose
having been compromised,

200
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,250
citizens of the region
were forced to take refuge

201
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,208
in a subterranean city within
the confines of Wall Sina.

202
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,583
However, though
emergency provisions

203
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,875
had been stockpiled
for the purpose,

204
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,708
with over half the
population relying on them,

205
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,333
rations could only last,
at most, a week.

206
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,916
Beyond that
lurked a terrible choice:

207
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,958
turn on each other like animals,

208
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,083
or face the prospect
of starvation.

209
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:49,125
To avoid a humanitarian crisis
of catastrophic proportions,

210
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,291
within a week of
the Titan onslaught,

211
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,000
authorities declared
Wall Rose secure.

212
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,666
[knock, knock, knock]

213
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,583
Hange. Come in.

214
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,208
Pardon the intrusion, Erwin.

215
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,708
Commander Pyxis.
Glad we caught you.

216
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,166
[doorknob clicks, thuds]

217
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,625
Um, this is...
State your name.

218
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,416
Sir! Conny Springer, sir!

219
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,416
Hundred and fourth Cadet Corps!

220
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,125
Conny here is
originally from Ragako.

221
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,583
Ah, yes. Where the invasion
seems to have begun, correct?

222
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:34,083
[HANGE] Yes, sir.
In fact, he's corroborated

223
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,833
a valuable piece of evidence
in that regard.

224
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,250
I think you'll find his story
supports our hypothesis.

225
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,833
Soldier, if you would.

226
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:51,166
[EREN] I allowed myself to be
kidnapped. It's my fault.

227
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,916
Because of me
the Scouts lost over

228
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,541
half of their
veteran contingent.

229
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:00,958
All in a single
rescue attempt.

230
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:05,041
Still, though. There were no
casualties on the way back.

231
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,333
The Titans
completely ignored us.

232
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,791
They were too fixated
on Reiner and the others.

233
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,666
Jean and I, we mulled it over
between us once we got back.

234
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,666
[EREN]
Huh?

235
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,000
Hear me out.
Suppose they acted that way...

236
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,500
...because of you?

237
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,500
[EREN gasps]

238
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,916
[JEAN]
Just a thought, of course.

239
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,208
But as far as
an explanation,

240
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,291
it's about as good as we've got.

241
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,833
I'm not saying I envy
the position you're in.

242
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,458
Maybe all those people
really did die for nothing.

243
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,458
That all depends on you.

244
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,708
If you're really
worth the sacrifice,

245
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,125
you'd better prove it.

246
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,333
There's no time
for second-guessing.

247
00:19:56,625 --> 00:20:01,291
You're right.
I have to be decisive.

248
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:05,750
If this is real--
if I can control Titans--

249
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,166
I have to plug up Wall Maria.

250
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,666
Then make Reiner answer
for what he's done.

251
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,458
People died for me. I have
to earn what they gave.

252
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,958
[PYXIS]
Come again?

253
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,250
You're saying the
Titans responsible for this

254
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,291
were the citizens of Ragako?

255
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:34,875
I see. So, in actuality,
Titans are human beings.

256
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:41,083
Well, we don't have proof yet.

257
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,125
[LEVI]
Great. Perfect.

258
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:48,541
I've spent all this time.
All this energy.

259
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,916
And the things I've been
carving through like carrion

260
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,500
were people.

261
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,708
Look, we don't know
for a certainty.

262
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,750
[CONNY sniffs]

263
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,791
Now what?

264
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,083
Um, excuse me.

265
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,541
What's with that smile?

266
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,708
Oh, it's nothing.

267
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:31,541
Just... seems to me
we've taken one more step

268
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,500
toward the truth.

269
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,958
Wow. One whole step, huh?

270
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,500
At this pace
we'll run out of people

271
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,541
before we actually reach it.

272
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,333
Not a good rate of return.

273
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,708
Everything comes at a price.

274
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,666
One day we'll get close
enough to break through.

275
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,375
The wall barring us from
the truth... will tumble.

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,041
Not just yet.
