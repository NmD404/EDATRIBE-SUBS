Eren and Ymir were taken.

They're gone. Reiner and

about five hours ago.

Our only option is to wait.

The mounts can't be hauled over
until the lifts make it here

225
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,041
and that takes time.

There's nothing else
we can do right now.

Section Commander Hange

We don't have enough soldiers
to form a scouting party.

Even a small one would
need more than this.

We just can't do it.

...not the first time
I've been down this road.

I didn't waste
a second. Not one.

That's how Captain Levi and I
were able to get him back.

been five hours.

Hey, Armin.

Why's he do it? Always leave?

Always end up
someplace we're not?

Yeah, it does
seem to happen a lot.

247
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,625

liked to run off on his own.

the sort of person

I guess.

Doesn't seem very fair,
but what do I know?

Different time, different
place, same problem.

a healthy relationship.

there are similarities.

he's beaten all to hell.

I may not've ever had the
privilege of seeing Eren win,

the piss outta me sometimes.

he gets right back up again.

It's in his blood.

288
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,333

be snatched away

tooth and nail?

00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,208

he's got left, he'll use it.

it's that Eren'll give 'em hell.

or me shows up to help.

344

this is almost definitely
where we would find them.

They need to recoup.

They have the power
to assume Titan form,

00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,291
Let's suppose they're headed
somewhere beyond Wall Maria.

354
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,125
That's not a simple hike.

355
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,708
They'll need all
the rest they can get

356
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,000
before covering
that kind of distance.

357
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,083
They're in no shape
to make it in a single push.

358
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,375
And if so, they'll want
to catch their breath

359
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,666
somewhere other Titans
can't get to them.

360
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,875
Odds are they'll
hold out till it gets dark.

361
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,416
[REINER]
You're awake.

362
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,875
[REINER]
Welcome back.

363
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,333
[HANGE]
We have until sundown!

364
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,000
[HANGE] If we can
reach the forest by then,

365
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:15,500
we might just have
a chance to save them!

366
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,458
[ERWIN]
Let's move!

367
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:31,875
♪ Closing Song ♪

368
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,833
[NARRATOR] Eren wakes,
surrounded by trees.

369
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,916
Desperate to escape,
he attempts to transform,

370
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,416
only for Ymir
to convince him otherwise.

371
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,583
Deep in the isolated forest,

372
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,916
emotions reach
the boiling point.

373
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,375
Eren and Reiner clash.

374
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,250
This must be settled
once and for all.

375
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,291
For themselves,
and for all who've perished.

376
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,958
Next episode: "Opening."
