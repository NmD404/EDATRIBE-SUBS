There it is again!

00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,500
Wh-Where is it coming from?

00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,416
[BOTH gasp]

4
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,333
[NARRATOR] Setting camp at
the ruins of Utgard Castle

00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,375
for the night,

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:33,083
the Scouts found themselves
overtaken by a Titan horde.

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,458
Their chances of survival low.

8
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,625
[CHRISTA]
Nanaba. Gelgar.

9
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,416
I'm sorry, Daddy!
I'll be a good girl

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
from now on, I promise!

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,125
[NARRATOR]
But when all seemed lost.

12
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,291
[YMIR]
Listen to me.

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,958
When you break it down,

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,583
this is really
just more of a hope.

15
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,958
Christa. Live a life
you can be proud of.

16
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,375
[CHRISTA]
Ymir! Wait!

17
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,666
[NARRATOR] One of their own
made a shocking transformation.

18
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,875
Yeah! Atta girl!

19
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:10,000
[YMIR TITAN]
Wanna live? Grab on tight.

20
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,458
[CONNY]
That's not good.

21
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,000
[gasps]

22
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,666

They're eating her!

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,916
[CHRISTA] No! I still
haven't told you my name!

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,958
I promised you!

25
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,000
[NARRATOR] The main force
of the Scout Regiment

26

Die!

00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:53,208
[NARRATOR] However, standing
on the wreckage of battle,

31
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,916
Eren and the others
bore witness

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,833
to a heartbreaking confession.

33
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,500
[CHRISTA]
Ymir.

34
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,625
Just as promised.

00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,208

Steady the ropes, please.

39
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,000
[EREN]
What's the verdict?

40
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,083
How bad a shape is Ymir in?

41
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,583
[KEIJI] Well, she's missing
an arm and a leg.

42
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,708
And her insides are scrambled.

43
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,666
If she was normal,
she'd be a goner.

44
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,333
[EREN]
Normal, huh?

45
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,875
[REINER groans]

[EREN]
Here, grab my hand.

47
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,833
Thanks.

48
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,000
[CHRISTA] Please,
you've got to believe me!

49
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,541
I'm telling the truth!

50
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,541
Ymir could've run away
any time she wanted!

51
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,750
She chose to fight the
Titans to save our lives!

52
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,416
She had nothing to gain
putting herself

53
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,041
on the line like that.

54
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,375
Doesn't that speak volumes
about where her loyalties are?

55
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,583
She should have
told us before, yes.

56
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,958
She had no right to keep
her power a secret.

57
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,250
It's hard to look past how much
humankind might've gained

58
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,250
from knowing what she's been
keeping to her self, but...

59
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,500
I think... I think
she was just worried

60
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,625
about what people
might do to her.

61
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,250
Clearly her priorities
have changed now.

62
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,250
This isn't nearly as
complicated as it looks.

63
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,541
No one is closer
to Ymir than me,

64
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:45,291
and there's no question in my
mind whose side she's on!

65
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,333
Is that so?

66
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,916
Well, under
the circumstances

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,416
it certainly behooves us
to be friendly.

68
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,125
Her priorities aside,

69
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,250
I'll wager what she can
teach us about the enemy

70
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,708
is beyond measure. Probably.

71
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,916
Even so. You say this
isn't as complicated

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,958
as it looks, but from
where I'm standing

73
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,958
the world gets more
complicated by the hour.

74
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:17,500
[HANGE] Oh, uh--Historia Reiss
you said your name was?

75
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,916
I did. That's correct.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,166
[HANGE] Isn't Reiss the name
of a noble family?

77
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,333
Yes, it is.

78
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,291
Huh.

79
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,333
Historia, nice to meet'cha.

80
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,333
Thank you.

81
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,750
[HANGE]
How's she doing?

82
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,083
Comatose but stable.
The bleeding's stopped,

83
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:51,416
though steam appears to be
coming out of her wounds.

84
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,583
Best course of action
is taking her back to Trost

85
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,541
where the poor girl can
get proper medical care.

86
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,166
She's in your hands.

87
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,958
Consider it done.

88
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,791
Right, then.
On with our mission.

89
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,500
Finding the hole
and patching it up.

You okay over there, Reiner?

92
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,583
[REINER]
Not by a long shot.

93
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,666
Titan almost gnawed my arm off.

94
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,708
Pathetic. All I could think
was "this it how I go."

95
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,541
What else you s'posed
to think at time like that?

96
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,958
You're only human.

97
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,291
Don't you get it?
This was my second time!

98
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,750
Armin! Remember?

99
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,000
Huh?

100
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,416
[REINER]
Go on!

00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,458
Tell him how Annie nearly
crushed me like an insect!

102
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,083
[ARMIN]
Yeah.

103
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,125
That's twice
I've nearly died now.

104
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,791
What are the chances
I'll survive a third time?

105
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,833
This is what it really means.

106
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,083
What it is to be soldier.

107
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:21,416
Your spirit breaks
and the body follows.

108
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,666
Eh. No good
whining about it now.

109
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,416
'Least not till we can
plug up the wall.

110
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,291
That's true. The two
of you have been driven

111
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,875
far enough away from
your hometown as it is.

[BERTHOLDT] Truer words
were never spoken!

115
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:47,375
Home! Let's go!
We've been here long enough!

116
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,708
Compared to everything
else we've had

117
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,625
to go through,
the rest is easy!

118

You're right.

119
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:58,041
We don't have much further
to go before it's done!

120
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,500
[EREN]
What are guys talking about?

121
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,250
I needed that. Thanks.

122
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,666
Are you injured?

123
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,125
Nah, I'm okay,
but, Reiner's wounded.

124
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,791
And Ymir's sure
seen better days.

125
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,791
[SASHA] Who would've ever
pegged her for a Titan?

126
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,375
--Are they--?
--[MIKASA] Sasha.

127
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,250
[HANGE]
We all on the same page?

128
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,375
We'll decide what to do
with Ymir later.

129
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,583
Oh, and Conny?

130
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,291
Chin up. I'll order a squad
to investigate your village.

131
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,958
For now, stay focused.

132
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,541
I want our energy on
the task at hand. Clear?

133
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,166
Crystal!

134
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,583
[HANGE]
It's troubling.

135
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,958
You would expect this area
to be teeming with Titans.

136
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,541
Hm?

137
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,708
[SASHA]
Hannes?

138
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,083
Is that the
Garrison advance squad?

139
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,875
Tell me they've
located the breach.

140
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,375
Wall's perfectly fine.

141
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,666
What?

142
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,125
[HANNES] Spent all night
trying to find out

143
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,625
where they're getting in.

144
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,750
But between Trost and Krolva
District, there's nothing.

145
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,083
No hole anywhere.

146
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,750
That's impossible!

147
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,916
We ran into a
search party from Krolva

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,666
and retraced our steps.

149
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,333
Not a single Titan
on the way here either.

150
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,000
[ARMIN] But we know for a fact
that there are Titans

151
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,791
on this side of Wall Rose.

152
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:28,958
Oh, C'mon.

153
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,083
How much have you
had to drink, seriously?

154
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,208
Why you little!

155
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,458
Hold on, wait a second.

156
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,958
What the hell are
you kids even doing here?

157
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:46,958
If there's no breach,

158
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,916
then I guess we
have to change tactics.

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,833
We head back
to Trost immediately.

160
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,583
You'd be smart
to keep your guard up.

161
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,916
We'll go on ahead of you.

162
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,000
How can there be
nothing wrong with the wall?

163
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,500
[ARMIN]
Excellent question.

164
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,000
Nothing like this
has happened in five years.

165
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,250
Why now all of a sudden?

166
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,125
[SASHA] Feels like everything's
spiraling out of control.

167
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,291
[REINER]
Eren.

168
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:27,208
We should talk.
You got a moment?

169
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,833
Sure, I guess.

170
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,791
[REINER] Five years ago,
we compromised Wall Maria

171
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,083
and launched
an attack on humanity.

172
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,500
Oh no. What if there's
a species of Titan

173
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,708
we haven't seen yet
that knows how to dig?

174
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,250
Ugh. That would
definitely make

175
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,916
their entry point hard to find.

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,041
[REINER] I'm the Armored Titan.
He's the Colossal.

177
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,791
[HANGE]
We can hypothesize later.

178
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,083
Our first concern is Ymir.

179
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,833
[MOBLIT] Titans being a close
second, even with the horses.

180
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,083
What are you talking about?

181
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,416
Why are you telling him?
Reiner, no!

182
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,833
--Stop!
--We were on a mission.

183
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,500
Our goal was to ensure
mankind's extinction.

184
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:08,416
But now,
there's no need for that.

185
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,291
Eren, if you want the
walls to remain standing,

186
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:16,583
it's simple. Just come
with Bertholdt and me.

187
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,500
Do you understand?

188
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,541
Understand? What the hell
is there to understand?

189
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:26,083
[REINER] Listen to me. I need
you to do exactly as I say.

190
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,541
[REINER] Look, I know this is
sudden, but we have to go.

191
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,666
Right now?
Where would you take me?

192
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,125
I can't tell you. Not yet.

193
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,583
Just think of it
as our hometown.

194
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,916
Okay? So what's it gonna be?

195

[gasps]

196
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,875
[REINER]
Not a bad deal, right?

197
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,333
The chance to avert
a major crisis?

198
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,625
I'm not so sure.

199
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:08,250
You guys! Get a move on,
we're heading out!

200
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,166
[EREN] Damn it.
I didn't want to believe

201
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,166
what I was hearing yesterday.

202
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,791
[horse neighs]


203
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,333
[HANGE]
Hmmm.


204
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,541
[EREN] Section Commander?
Something wrong?


205
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,541
Uh--Huh? Oh, uh,
well I was finally able

206
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,208
to get my hands on
the background report

207
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,958
I requested for Annie Leonhart.

208
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,416
Annie?

209
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,000
[HANGE] Yeah. Took longer
than I was hoping for.

210
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,000
The paper trail's a bit of
a catastrophe at the moment.

211
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,041
Bureaucracy, huh?

212
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,666
Anyway, according to this,
there were two other cadets

213
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,291
in the 104th who haled
from the same region.

214
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,500
I have their names.

215
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:05,625
One Reiner Braun
and Bertholdt Hoover.

216
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,750
[gasps]

217
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,750
[gasps]

218
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,916
Not much survives
in the way of records,

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,875
and thanks to the chaos
five years ago,

220
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,458
what we have on them
is unreliable.

221
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,125
However, we do know
that during the long-range

222
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,541
scouting formation, their
unit was given false intel.

223
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,041
They were among those
intentionally misled into

224
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,958
thinking Eren
was in the right wing.

225
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,875
[gasps]
Wait just a minute.

226
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,125
That's the section
Annie attacked.

227
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,250
[SASHA]
What? What does that mean?

228
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,916
Well, it's entirely
possible they told Annie

229
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,583
where they thought Eren was.

230
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,416
Huh? Why would they do that?

231
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,250
Where are you
going with this, Armin?

232
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,500
You can't just accuse--!

233
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,083
[HANGE]
I totally agree.

234
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:54,416
Coincidence doesn't
establish relationship.

235
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,375
Bearing that in mind,
I'm curious to know

236
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,000
how the three interacted
while training.

237
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,000
What can you tell me?

238
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,458
I knew Bertholdt and Reiner
were from the same region

239
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,250
as Annie, but I never
saw them act friendly.

240
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,583
Same with me.

241
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,541
You'd never catch 'em
shootin' the breeze.

242
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,500
And when they did talk
it was pretty curt.

243
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,208
Plus, it's not like Annie was
very social to begin with.

244
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,708
Yeah, at meals
she always seemed to prefer

245
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,208
eating by herself. I dunno.

246
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,916
Ah! I think I've got
something that struck me

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,083
as weird at the time.

248
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,708
I, uh...
heard she liked sweets!

249
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,166
I've got nothing.
Except maybe that--

250
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,166
[EREN]
Guys. What are we doing?

251
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,458
These are our comrades
we're talking about.

252
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,083
Yeah, sure. Bertholdt
never has a lot to say.

253
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,791
But Reiner's like everyone's
big brother, y'know?

254
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,708
You really think
he's capable of lying to us?

255
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,708
Eren does have a point.
Think about it.

256
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,750
Reiner fought the Female Titan
with everything he had.

257
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,500
Almost got himself squeezed to
a bloody pulp in the process.

258
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,791
--[gasps]
--What's the matter?

259
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,000
He burst free of her grip
at the last minute.

260
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,208
Afterwards, though,
Annie changed her course.

261
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:11,458
In fact, she ran straight
toward where you were.

262
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,833
I-- I mentioned
that you might be

263
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,000
rear of the center rank,

264
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,333
but there's no way
she could've heard me.

265
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,666
She wasn't in earshot
at the time.

266
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,583
You've gotta be kidding.

267
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,125
Do you recall if he seemed
unusually interested

268
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,458
in Eren's location?

269
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:35,416
So, where the hell
do you think he is?

270
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,291
[ARMIN]
Oh, no.

271
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,541
I only brought his position
up in the first place

272
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:48,375
because Reiner asked me where
I thought Eren might be.

273
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,750
Something else.
Once he broke free,

274
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,500
the Female Titan stood
there staring at her palm,

275
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,083
possibly transfixed
by something

276
00:16:56,166 --> 00:17:00,000
he'd carved onto it
with his blades.

277
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,666

278
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,416

don't give them any indication
of what we've discussed.

And under no
circumstances are you

285
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,541
to broach the topic of Annie
Leonhart in their company.

286
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,833
Before we can ascertain whether
they were co-conspirators,

287
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,250
we must find, lure,
and contain them underground.

288
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,000
