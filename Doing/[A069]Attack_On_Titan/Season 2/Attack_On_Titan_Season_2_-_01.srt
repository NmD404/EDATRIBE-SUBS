really been breached?

178
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,583
[NANABA] Ride! I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid lunch

179
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,625
is going to have to wait!

180
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,458
Miche.

181
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,291
[MICHE] Nine of them.
In that swarm up ahead.

182
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,791
[NANABA] They must've
broken through Wall Rose.

183
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,458
[NANABA] Damn it.
We never even got the chance

184
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:40,000
to figure out what in
god's name these things are.

185
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,500
Now, it's too late.

186
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:47,708
Humanity has lost.
This is the end.

187
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,625
Like hell it is.
We're not done.

188
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,750
Not yet. A person only
loses when they give in.

189
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,500
Remember that.

190
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,583
As long as we keep
putting up a fight,

191
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,708
we haven't been beaten!

192
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,625
[MICHE] The second the Titans
reach the woods, we'll split up.

193
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,541
I want four separate teams.

194
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,250
Recruits and soldiers
alike in each unit.

195
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,666
When I give the signal,

196
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,375
we'll scatter in different
directions simultaneously.

197
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,125
Get the word out
to civilians.

198
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,333
Do not engage the enemy!

199
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,041
Which one of you is most
familiar with the area?

200
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,333
Uh, me!

201
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,416
Sir, my home town's
just to the north of here!

202
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,291

like the back of my hand!

203
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,000

204
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,500
What's wrong?

205
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,541
My village.

206
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,041
My village is to the south.

207
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,500
That's where the Titans
are coming from.

208
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,916
I can lead you
to nearby settlements,

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,916
but afterwards...

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,125
...let me go home. Please.

211
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,291
Very well.

212
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,791
Guide the southern team,
then go to your village.

213
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,000
Yes, sir!

214
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,250
I'll come with you.

215
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,666
What? No, you're crazy.

216
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,208
They'll be everywhere.

217
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,666
You think I care?

218
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,416
I was gonna help you
get home anyway, wasn't I?

219
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,625
What about you? You coming?

220
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,000
Of course. Wouldn't
miss it for the world.

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,291
[NANABA]
As you have guessed,

222
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,833
today marks the darkest hour
in humanity's history!

223
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,375
Look sharp. If ever
we needed to give our all,

224
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,541
that time is now!
Don't lose heart!

225
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,666
[GELGAR]
They've reached the woods!

226
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,916
The enemy is on top of us!

227
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,208
[MICHE]
Scatter, now!

228
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,333
Ride for everything
you're worth!

229
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,500
[MICHE] No. They're
coming at us full tilt!

230
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,833

Huh? Holy shit!

231

Uh, understood.

[FEMALE SOLDIER 26B] Tell me
he's not using himself as bait!

236
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,708
I'll go with him!
I can help!

237
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,833
Stay where you are!

238
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,208
We can't spare
any more soldiers!

239
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,333
Give him some credit.

240
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,458
That man's skills are
second only to Captain Levi.

241
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,791

Yeah, well, I'm not the one
who started it this time!

were making fun of me!

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,708
Of course. Did Mikasa
come to your rescue again?

247
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,333
Thank you, dear.

248

Being an adult means learning
how to pick your battles.

251
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,416
You want them to think
that you're strong?

252
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,083
Exercise restraint.

253
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,625

once in a while.
