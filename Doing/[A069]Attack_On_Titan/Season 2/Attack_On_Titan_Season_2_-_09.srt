[EREN] Let me think.
Suppose I wait for an opening.

If I assume Titan form,
running away wouldn't really

Titan form in this condition?

Reiner doesn't seem to think so,

00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,333

transform to full strength?

102
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,458
Does that mean the other Titans
would be able to eat me?

103
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,458

sit on our asses

Well, at least now we know

where we stand. Sort of.

00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,083
[REINER] Speaking of which.
We've been working

00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:26,375
our asses off. No food,
no sleep, no nothing.

those Titans showed up.

Man, we're lucky the wall
hasn't been destroyed.

163
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,458
Still, you'd think that means
they'd give us a break.

164
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:41,291
And don't even get me
started on promotion.

too much to ask, do you?

00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,500
Ugh. Don't give me that.

175
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm not sayin' we
storm in and demand

176
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,291
the rank of captain
or anything.

177
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,791
[YMIR]
No. That's not what I mean.

178
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,958
[REINER] Oh, yeah. Where'd you
find that cannon, by the way?

179
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,958
I owe you one
for saving my bacon.

180
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,750
[YMIR exhales]

181
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,666
[REINER] Really nice of Christa
to patch me up afterwards.

182
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,375
I'm starting to think me
and her might become a thing.

183
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,541
[EREN]
Hey.

184
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,291
Right? It's not just me?

185
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,708
She always treats me
like we're--

186
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,625
[EREN]
Hey!

187
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:49,708
What's wrong with you?
You've got to be kidding me.

188
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,166
Huh? What're you so
pissed about all of a sudden?

189
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,083
Take it easy, man. Was it
something I said, or?

190
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,958
If you wanna die,
then just keep talking!

191
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,000
[YMIR]
Hold up, Eren.

192
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,833
I think somebody's
gone off the deep end.

193
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,625
Is that what this is, Bertholdt?

194
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,500
If you know something we don't,

195
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,541
now would be a good time
to put it on the table.

196
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,166
Huh?

197
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,875
[BERTHOLDT]
Reiner. Snap out of it.

198
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,875
You're not a soldier, okay?

199
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,333
You and I are... We're warriors.

200
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:34,375
[REINER breathes quaveringly]

201
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,000
[MARCO]
Reiner! What are you doing?

202
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,541
[MARCO screams, gasps]

203
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,125
[REINER]
Hey. Why...?

204
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,833
[BERTHOLDT gasps]

205
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:56,125
Why is Marco... being devoured?

206
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:09,083
Right. I see.
That's how things are.

207
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:14,166
[sobs softly]

208
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,125
What the hell's he doing?

209
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:24,541
I have a pretty good idea.
At least I think so.

210
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,416
Didn't add up at first.

211
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,333
Why would the man
who broke the wall

212
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,541
risk his neck to save Conny?

213
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,125
It's like the poor
bastard's personality is

214
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,833
compartmentalized.

215
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,916
Everything he does is
a contradiction in terms.

216
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,583
He can't help it.

217
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,416
On one hand,
he's a warrior bent on

218
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,458
pushing mankind past the brink.

219
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,208
On the other he's
pretending to be a soldier.

220
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,541
I'm thinking maybe he got
a little lost in the role.

221
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,166
See. He can't resolve
those facets of himself.

222
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,375
Can't bear the weight
of what he's done.

223
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,416
The only way for him
to manage his conscience

224
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,166
is to fall for his own act.

225
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,333
He thinks he is a soldier.

226
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,333
This is what you call
a split personality.

227
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,041
He's gone insane.

228
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,250
His heart and mind
are at war with each other,

229
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,625
and judging by
Bertholdt's expression,

230
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,125
this isn't the first stalemate.

231
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,875
Blows me away!

232
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,666
Wow, someone as brutally honest
as you losing their grip--

233
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,666
[REINER]
Shut up! Not another word.

234
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,833
I'm sorry.
Must've really hit a nerve.

235
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,708
[EREN]
Is this some kind of joke?

236
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,833
Where do you get off
pretending to be the victim?

237
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,625
You're wallowing in self-pity?

238
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:51,166
How dare you. What was
going through your head

239
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,083
the day I told you
my story, huh?

240
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,541
Remember that, Bertholdt?

241
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,625
I'm talking to you, lackey!

242
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,833
I told you everything.

243
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,541
You sat there and looked me
straight in the eye.

244
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,500
Watched me relive seeing
my mother eaten alive.

245
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,916
[EREN]
Stop it! No!

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,625
Don't you remember?

247
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,500
Well, it just so happens
the chunk of wall

248
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,625
you kicked out
fell on our house.

249
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:20,125
It's what kept her from
being able to run away.

250
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:24,875
Ring any bells? Take you back?

251
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,208
Let me ask you again.

252
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:32,708
What was going through your head
when I told you that story?

253
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,583
Want me to be honest?

254
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,916
In the moment I felt...
sorry for you.

255
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:52,500
[EREN]
Huh. Sorry for me?

256
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:56,333
So, then. You're not...

257
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:02,625
You're not warriors or soldiers.
You're just murderers.

258
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,375
Psychotic mass-murderers
who snuffed out the lives

259
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,583
of countless people that
never did you any wrong.

260
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,416
Don't you think
I'm aware of that fact?

261
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,916
I don't need you shoving it
down my goddamn throat!

262
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,833
Then stop acting
like you've got any right

263
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,500
to feel sorry for yourself!

264
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,041
We're living in a hell
you two created!

265
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,500
Are you proud of yourselves?

266
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,291
You're not one of us!
You've never been!

267
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,375
You're not even human anymore!

268
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,875
[REINER]
You want an apology?

269
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,875
Is that what you hope to get
out of calling us murderers?

270
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,625
Want us to feel bad?
Want us to take the blame?

271
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,458
Who are you talking to?

272
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,333
The people you thought
you knew don't exist!

273
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,333
They're dead! But hey,
if screaming does it for ya,

274
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:40,000
go ahead and scream
your goddamn head off!

275
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:50,166
[REINER panting]

276
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,875
[EREN]
You're right.

277
00:17:54,958 --> 00:18:00,791
Who am I? What do I know?

278
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:07,750
Still. I've got to do
something. Anything.

279
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,208
I swear to you,
one way or another,

280
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:15,416
the two of you will pay.
And it's gonna hurt.

281
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,166
[YMIR]
You can't be for real.

282
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,708
Huh?

283
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,208
Eren, grow up.
Keep spouting off

284
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,833
childish bullshit like that
and I've got no hope for you.

285
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,000
[EREN grunts]

286
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,458
[YMIR]
Tell me something.

287
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,208
What's with the giant monkey?

288
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,000
[REINER] Monkey?
What're you talking about?

289
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,083
Huh. I thought
for sure you'd know.

290
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,125
That's surprising. From the way
you guys were ogling it

291
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,958
all slack-jawed
I figured we were seeing

292
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,208
some kind of living legend.

293
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,250
Weird.

294
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,291
A monkey? Don't be cute.

295
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,958
Shut up and listen.
Monkey, Beast Titan.

296
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:13,000
Whatever you wanna call him,
he's behind this latest fiasco.

297
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,333
It's why Titans are
cropping up out of nowhere.

298
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:20,958
I get the feeling
he's gauging our strength.

299
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,291
Reiner and Betholdt are
trying to get wherever he is.

300
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,333
It's how they're
getting back home.

301
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,000
Feel free to correct me
if I'm way off base.

302
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,125
[gasps]

303
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,666
Wait. How did you know?
Who are you?

304
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,291
What else haven't you told me?

305
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,666
Be patient. I'm caught up
in circumstances of my own.

306
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,458
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

307
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,833
Eren. If you think
killing these morons

308
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,750
will put an end to all of this,
you are sorely mistaken.

309
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,541
[EREN]
Huh? But then who's the enemy?

310
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,958
The enemy?

311
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,708
Look, if I told you,
things would get too--

312
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:58,000
[REINER] Ymir! There's no future
for this world and you know it.

313
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,333
[YMIR gasps]

314
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,958
[REINER] You have
a solid grasp of things.

315
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,708
What d'you think comes next?

316
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,875
Joining our side wouldn't
be out of the question

317
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,000
if you were so inclined.

318
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,958
[YMIR] And put my faith
in you guys? That's rich.

319
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,625
Neither of you trusts me
as far as you can throw me.

320
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,541
[REINER]
Come on. That isn't true.

321
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,166
We know what you really want.

322
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,041
All you care about
is protecting Christa.

323
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,958
If we can all agree on that,
I don't see the conflict.

324
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,500
I'm being absolutely serious.

325
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,916
Is it so hard to believe we
want what's best for her, too?

326
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,833
Hate to break it to ya,
but you're not the only one.

327
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,916
Then again, you could always
put your trust in Eren,

328
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,083
see where that leads you.

329
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,666
What?

330
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,000
[REINER] You're probably
leaning toward escape.

331
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,500
Better to take a chance with him
than throw in with us, right?

332
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
Because if we
end up taking you,

333
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,583
there's not much hope
of being rescued.

334
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,541
I'll be straight with you.
That much is true.

335
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,833
Even if you came willingly,
we're not in a position

336
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,458
to guarantee your safety.

337
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,791
But if it's Christa
we're talking about,

338
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,375
we might be able
to do something.

339
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,791
[YMIR gasps, snarls]

340
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,208
[REINER] It's your call.
What's it gonna be?

341
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:20,083
Is it Christa's future?
Or your own petty existence?

342
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,833
[EREN] Is there really
no future for this world?

343
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,458
Why? And the monkey.

344
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,375
How does he figure into this?

345
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,708
Come clean!
Who's the real enemy?

346
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,000
Tell me what you know!

347
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,416
Who is it?!

348
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,791
[YMIR sighs]

349
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,250
Couldn't say.

350
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,583
[EREN grunts]

351
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,458
[REINER]
All right, then. Sorry, Eren.

352
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,625
[distant gunshot]

353
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,666
[BERTHOLDT]
The Scouts are here? Already?

354
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,791
[REINER grunts]
Son of a bitch!

355
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:12,500
[EREN]
No. Damn you, Ymir!

356
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,791
[EREN] Only one hour
left until sunset.

357
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:31,916
♪ Closing Song ♪

358
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,083
[NARRATOR]
Night approaches swiftly.

359
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:04,291
The Scouts close in,
intent on rescuing Eren

360
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:07,291
from Reiner and Bertholdt.

361
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,250
The traitorous pair
attempts a bold escape

362
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,125
using their ODM gear.

363
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:17,791
Conflicted, reflecting on
her dark and bloodied past,

364
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:22,166
Ymir offers an alternative.

365
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,208
