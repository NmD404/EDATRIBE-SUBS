Well. They look promising.

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,750

What about this one?

176
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,750
[MAN 35B]
Mm.

177
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,375
[MAN 35A]
Hello there.

178
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,250
How would you feel about
coming to live with us?

179
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,958
Think of it as the start
of a brand-new life.

180
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:35,333
Of course, a brand-new life
needs a brand-new name.

181
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,083
Don't you agree?

182
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,625
[YMIR]
Huh?

183
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,916
[YMIR] That day... That was the
first time I lied to myself.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,583
Told myself I had
no say in the matter.

185
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:50,125
That I never
had a choice. But...

186
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,208
[MAN 35A] It is this Lady Ymir
that inherits the blood

187
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,750
of His Majesty the king.
So long as she graces us

188
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,875
with her presence,
immortality shall be ours.

[clapping]

190
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:09,291
[YMIR] To be fair,
it wasn't all that bad.

192
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:16,666
[YMIR] My food wasn't cold.
I no longer slept in the dirt.

[SISTER]
Lady Ymir.

194
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:22,250
[YMIR] Best of all, I knew what
it meant to feel needed.

195
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,833
For the first time in my life,

196
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,000
I actually meant something
to someone else.

197
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:31,166
That, by far, was more
precious than anything.

198
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,875
Then, one day...

199
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,583
[BELIEVERS holler]

200
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,458
[MAN 35A] It's her fault!
The girl's to blame!

201
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,208
She said the blood of the king
flowed in her veins!

202
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,416
We're only guilty
of believing her!

203
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,958
[YMIR] I was cruelly
reminded that everything

204
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:54,541
I clung to was an act.

205
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,625
Is that so?

206
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,333
I-I only...

207
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:13,041
It's true.

208
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,791
I am Ymir!

209
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,541

runs through me!

If it saved

quite work out that way.

[YMIR yelps]

221
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:01,000
[YMIR] That's when I realized
I'd had it coming all along.

222
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,375
I'd deceived
those gullible bastards,

223
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,125
but that wasn't what I was
being punished for really.

224
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,791
It was for deceiving myself

225
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,708
into thinking
someone needed me.

226
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,375
What else did I expect?

227
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,250
That's what comes of looking
at the world through a veil.

[YMIR]
When I opened my eyes,

237
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:18,500
the first thing
I saw was freedom.

238
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,708
The first thing I thought

239
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,625
was if there's
such thing as fate,

240
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,708
she's a fickle little whore.

241
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,708
[laughs]

242
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,625
Right then and there

243
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,041
I made a vow.

244
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,875
No more deceiving myself.

245
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,416
No more falling
for my own line.

246
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,291
From then on, I'd be real.

247
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,708
[MALE ORDER OF THE WALLS 35A]
So, how did that play out?

248
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,583
Ah, the child was given
the name "Christa Lenz."

249
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,041
Then, she was packed off
to the Cadet Corps.

250
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,625
That is a pity.

251
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,208
Poor wretch. Would've been
better were she never born.

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,791
Are you trying
to pick a fight?

253
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,500
All right, sure.
Makes no difference to me.

254
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,208

And then...

255

What do we have here?

256
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,000

of trying to be nice?

Well, uh.

And then I met you.

Immediately, I could tell.

You and I were the same.

to convince herself of
something she knew wasn't true.

I get it. Believe me.

And don't worry.

I'm not asking you
to understand.

No. What I want
is very simple.

Just let me be honest
with myself one last time.

that I give a damn?

I have the advantage.

283

Any other time you two
would outclass me.

But my Titan form's more agile.

285
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,208
I could leap through
the trees, grab Eren,

00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,000
and rendezvous with the Scouts
before you knew what hit you.

287

to see her again!
