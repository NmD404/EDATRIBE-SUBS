What now? A knife's
the only thing we got.

175
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,666
Should I cut the nape, or--?

176
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,375
Don't risk it. Get grabbed,
you'll get hurt.

177
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,500
[CHRISTA] Then, I think
it would be best

178
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,750
if we head back
upstairs for now.

179
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,125
We have no way
of knowing if that's

180
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,791
the only one who got in.

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,125
Huh?

182
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,666
[CHRISTA]
Conny!

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,125
Huh?

184
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,708

Holy-- What're you doing?

190
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,541
Wait. Are you?

191
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,958
Are you gonna jump out
the window with it?

192
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,916
We've got no other choice.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,041
No! Wait!
Just give me a second!

194
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,458
I think I can
slice its jaw open!

197
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,833
[CONNY] What do we do
if another one gets in?

198
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,041
Not like we'll find another
cannon lying around, am I right?

199
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,458
Probably. Lightning
won't strike twice.

200
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,375
--[grunts]
--Sorry, I know it stings.

201
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,666
Plus, the bone's
most likely fractured.

202
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,375
Of course. It's about
how my luck runs.

203
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,750
We'll need a splint
and a bandage. Easy enough.

[CHRISTA]
The cloth's filthy.

207
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:57,666
I haven't been able to wash
it in forever. I'm sorry.

208
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,666
No sweat. It does the job.

209
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,291
[REINER]
Marry me.

210
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,208
So you gonna
be all right or what?

211
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,125
Think so. Probably.

212
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,541
Y'know, Christa, I, uh--

213
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,625
I got a little
scratched up myself.

214
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,583
Ugh. So just
spit on it or somethin'.

215
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:19,166
Anyway, sorry about
all that, man.

216
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,041
Seems like you're always
having to save my ass.

217
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,000
You and everyone else.

218
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,791
Even Annie put herself
on the line for me once.

219
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,833
I owe you. A lot.

220
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,541
No, no. It's fine.

221
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,708
We have each other's back.

222
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,458
It's what soldiers do.

223
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,916
I don't know.

224
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,583
I doubt I could ever
be that courageous.

225
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,541
Has he always been like this?

226
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,541
The self-sacrificing type?

227
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,916
No. He's changed a bit.

228
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,375
In the old days, Reiner
was more of a warrior.

229
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:59,916
Warrior? I'm not
quite sure I understand.

230
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,083
[YMIR] Anyway, let's scrounge
around for stuff we can use.

231
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,541
If I have to die,
I'd rather not do it

232
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,916
'cause we're being half-assed.

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,833
Oh, wow.
Well, all right then.

for the big ones.

Good thing
we have this tower.

239
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,750
No kidding. Think we might
just survive the night.

240
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,166
We'll check on the recruits.

241
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,875
Okay.

as many as before!

You're kidding!

260
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,750
It's like they're
timing these attacks

261
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,416
as some part of
a larger strategy.

262
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,416
This isn't random at all.

00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,458
I have no business telling
you how to live your life.

349
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,958
It's not my place.

350
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,250
So, I guess
when you break it down,

351
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,875
this is really
just more of a hope.

352
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:45,125
Christa. Live a life
you can be proud of.

the promise we made.

[NARRATOR] "Live a life
you can be proud of."

362
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,416
With those words,
Ymir unleashes

363
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,000
a terrible power few suspected.

364
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:10,125
Between her and Christa
is an unbreakable bond.

365
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,875
A promise made in the depths
of their shared past.

366

Even as Ymir
reveals herself,

367
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,125
Christa, too, transforms.

368
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:22,416
Shedding the veneer
she's clung to for so long.
