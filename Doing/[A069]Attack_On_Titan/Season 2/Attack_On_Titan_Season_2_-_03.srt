00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,416
using consolidated Titan skin.

177
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,625
You're kidding me.

178
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,958
That's what Armin
was trying to say.

179
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,083
[gasps]

180
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,333
So, then--!

181
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,916
Easy. It's rude to steal
someone else's thunder.

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,291
As it stands, we'd be
hard-pressed to find a rock

183
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,000
big enough to plug Wall Rose.

184
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,333
It'd have to be just
the right shape and size,

185
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,500
and we don't have specifics yet.

186
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,208
[ARMIN, HANGE]
But, on the other hand,

187
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,541
where there's
a will there's a way.

188
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,000
Picture Eren utilizing
his hardening ability

189
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,458
while in Titan form.

190
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:52,416
I could... patch the hole.

191
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,083
The sealant should be composed
of the same material.

192
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,458
And the hardened bit
won't dissolve

193
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,333
once you've transformed back.

194
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,083
This might be less of
a long shot than it sounds.

195
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,250
Thoughts?

196
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,541
Well, anything worthwhile
incurs a little risk.

197
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,416
If we can manage
to shore up Wall Rose,

198
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,000
Wall Maria starts
to look fairly promising.

199
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,625
Vital as it is,
the outpost infrastructure

200
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,791
slows us down to a crawl.

201
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,708
The time and resources needed to
transport materials are immense.

202
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,083
But, if supply wagons don't
have to be accommodated,

203
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,375
we can make our way to
Shiganshina much faster.

204
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,291
And what if we decided
to carry out our plan

205
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,750
in the dead of night?

206
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,500
--[HANGE] Night?
--Yes.

207
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,125
When the Titans
are effectively motionless.

208
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,666
That's not bad.
In fact it's genius.

209
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,416
Particularly if
the group is small enough

210
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,708
to slip by undetected.

211
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,750
The straits we're in
are as dire as they come.

212
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,416
But there might just be
the teeniest bit of slack.

213
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,958
Yeah. Just bear
in mind, though,

214
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,583
the whole plan hinges
on whether or not

215
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,708
Eren can seal a hole, again.

216
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,583
[EREN gasps]

217
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,458
It's, uh, probably
unfair of me to even ask.

218
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,208
But do you think you can?

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,458
[LEVI] What he thinks
really isn't the issue.

220
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,708
You either will, or you won't.

221
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,708
That's the reality.

222
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,833
Our comrades are
breaking their backs,

223
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,625
but without you, it's nothing.

224
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,041
Failure isn't an option.

225
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,833
Sir! I know!

226
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,500
I'm prepared to do
whatever it takes!

227
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,875
That's a promise.

228
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,791
My father's cellar.
That's where the answers are.

229
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,541
If there's a grain of
truth in what he told me,

230
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,875
everything depends on
us making it there.

231
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,000
[HANGE]
Here's Ehrmich.

232
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,958
[gasps]

233
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:25,875
No one said stop. A rolling
stone gathers no moss.

234
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,333
This is...

235
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,916
Maybe you expected
to see something quaint?

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,041
This is what happens
when the walls give.

237
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:39,416
[BOY 28A sobs]
Mommy! Daddy!

238
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,833
[gasps]

239
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:45,000
[LEVI]
No. Take it in, holy man.

240
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,916
These are the faces
of human beings

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,250
who've lost everything
they ever had.

242
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:54,083
Human beings you and your
kind abandoned, incidentally.

243
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,375
Hard to look at it, I'd imagine.

244
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,916
But if the church had its way,
this'd be all of us.

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,583
Titans would pour in and
make a feast of what's left.

246
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,541
Shoveling man, woman, and child
down their putrescent gullets.

247
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,333
All humanity
digested as one.

248
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,375
[HANGE]
Once we leave Ehrmich,

249
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,041
we'll be in
Titan territory proper.

250
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,625
Eren. Well enough
to ride a horse yet?

251
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,250
[EREN] Yeah, should be
able to manage one

252
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,833
without much of a hassle.

253
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,166
Saddle up then, soldier.

254
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,125
There's a mount waiting
for you on the left lift.

255
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,000
[EREN]
Right.

256
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,958
Section Commander,
we're pressed for time.

257
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,791
Oh. Thanks, Moblit.
Give me a sec.

258
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,750
So? Seen the light yet,
by any chance?

259
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,208
Oh, goddamn it!
Make up your mind!

260
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:50,916
This isn't some spiritual test!
Lives are on the line!

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,208
Alas, I have no choice.

262
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,333
Neither myself nor
the others who believe

263
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,083
are at liberty
to divulge the truth.

264
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,083
Fat lot a help you are!

265
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,750
Thanks for keeping us company!
It's been fun!

266
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,625
[NICK] I'd offer
my help if I could,

267
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,541
but a duty as great
as this one is beyond me.

268
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,458
The Order of the Walls
abides by the sacred will

269
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,000
--our faith commands us to obey.
--[GIRL] Sir! Thank you, sir!

270
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,875
Whose "sacred will"?

271
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,875
You mean like,
God or something?

272
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,583
I can't answer that.
But what I can do

273
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,791
is provide you with a name.

274
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,208
An individual the sacred will
in its divine wisdom

275
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,416
instructed us to monitor.

276
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,416
Monitor?

277
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,000
It's a person you know.

278
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,875
Someone who enlisted with the
Scout Regiment as of this year.

279
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,333
[ALL gasp]

280
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,500
A child by the name of...

281
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,000
[SASHA]
Important message!

282
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,916
I'm with the 104th Cadet Corps!

283
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,333
Oh, and my name
is Sasha Braus!

284
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,166
[gasps]

285
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,500
[gasps]
No way.

286
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,750
Who?

287
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,333
Sorry. This is for you,
Section Commander.

288
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:58,375
You must find her with
all haste. She is the key.

289
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:02,166
She may know things
we understand but poorly.

290
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,833
And with that,
we come to the end

291
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,458
of what I'm free to share.

292
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,958
[inhales]

293
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,875
The rest I leave
in your capable hands.

294
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,333
But if-if she's in
the 104th Cadet Corps,

295
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,958
she's at the front lines by now!

296
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,875
Then let's go! Come on!
There's no time to lose!

297
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,791
[SASHA groans]

298
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,083
Watch where you're going!

299
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,625
Sasha?

300
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,375
Just where did you
come from all of a sudden?

301
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,916
I was sent to give a message
to Commander Erwin.

302
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,458
Who, then, entrusted me
to deliver this

303
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,083
to you,
Section Commander!

304
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,875
Oh, uh. Okay, then.
Excellent work.

305
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,958
[gasps]

306
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,666
[HANGE] So, who is
Nick talking about?

307
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,250
She was the smallest
one in our class.

308
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,541
Golden hair. Blue eyes.

309
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:53,125
In fact, she's uh...
kinda cute.

310
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,916
The girl who's always
hanging around Ymir.

311
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,291
Excuse me?

312
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,000
[REINER]
How can you read this?

313
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:10,750
Ymir. Do you?

314
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,833
Everyone, wake up!
Get to the tower immediately!

315
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,041
[LYNNE] I couldn't
see them in the dark,

316
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,333
but with the moonlight...

317
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,875
How can they move?
This shouldn't be happening!

318
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,583
The sun went down hours ago!

319
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,666
Wh-What's going on?

320
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,375
Hey, guys.
The hell is that?

321
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,250
It's gotta be a Titan,

322
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,791
but have you ever
seen one that big?

323
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:52,416
Look at it! It's more like,
some kind of beast.

324
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,416
How do we--?

325
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,583
Wait, is it?
It's headed for the wall!

326
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,166
That's the plan.
Are we clear?

327
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,500
[ALL]
Yes, clear!

328
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,750
Right. We have to go! Now!

329
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,791
[LEVI]
Calm down, Eren.

330
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,041
I need you all to listen.

331
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,958
We're going our separate ways.
That's how it has to be.

332
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,583
Erwin had his reasons
for throwing this

333
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:27,958
ragtag squad together, but right
now this is all riding on you.

334
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,250
Armin, you and Hange
are the brain trust.

335
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,333
Use your combined knowledge to
cook up some kind of solution.

336
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,125
Right. Yes, sir!

337
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,166
Mikasa. I don't think
I'll ever get why

338
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,250
you're so attached
to the guy, but,

339
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:44,125
put your skills to good use.
Protect Eren at all costs.

340
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,041
Sir! I intend to!

341
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,916
[LEVI]
And you.

342
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,791
Don't screw this up.

343
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,791
Hey, hey! Back off!
Don't be coming up here!

344
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,625
Ain't'cha got
nothin' better to do?

345
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,458
Bother someone else.

346
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,416
I should be drinking
right now, damn it!

347
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,375
You're standing between me
