00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,041
[NARRATOR] a route
to Shiganshina,

3
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,208
[NARRATOR] the Scout Regiment
encountered a Female Titan

4
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,875
[NARRATOR] seemingly
possessed of sharp,

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,583
[NARRATOR]
cold-hearted intelligence.

00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,166
[NARRATOR] As soldier upon
soldier fell to this new foe,

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,500
[NARRATOR] the
regiment retreated into

9
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,333
[NARRATOR] a forest
of massive trees.

10
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:40,416
[NARRATOR] Though
to what purpose,

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,291
[NARRATOR] no one
appeared to know.

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,041
[EREN] If the Levi Squad can't
stop this thing, then who can?

13
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,875
[EREN] Those men need us!

14
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,166
[EREN] Another one!

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,750
[EREN] Damn it,
he didn't have to die!

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,375
[LEVI] The choice is yours.
You can trust yourself,

17
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,916
[LEVI] or you can trust
the people willing to

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,291
[LEVI] put their lives
on the line for you.

19
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,166
I'm with you!

20
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,250
Fire!

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,791
[EREN] Wait, what?

22
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,375
[EREN] They're going to
take her alive? Seriously?

23
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,208
So what do you
think of us now, Eren?

24
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,375
We managed to
outsmart the damn thing!

25
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,333
Let this be a lesson
to you, greenhorn.

26
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't ever
underestimate the Scouts!

27
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,500
[ORUO] Never again! Agreed?

28
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,000
Agreed!

29
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,083
She's not putting
up much of a fight.

30
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,791
That's no reason
to let our guard down.

31
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,666
[ERWIN] Good work,
leading her here.

32
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,750
[ERWIN] I'm more than
a little impressed.

33
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,583
We couldn't have
without the rear contingent

34
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:56,541
whose lives bought us
time. This belongs to them.

35
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,833
I don't intend
to ever forget that.

36
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,500
That so?

37
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,041
[LEVI] Yes.

38
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,083
Because of their sacrifices,

39
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,000
[LEVI] we can expose
whoever this really is.

40
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,208
Ten to one they're in there

41
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,250
pissing themselves
right about now.

42
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,541
[EREN] An Abnormal?
No, she's more like--

43
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,583
more like the Colossal Titan!

44
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,250
Wait, so does that mean
Commander Erwin was--?

45
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,708
Hey! Snap out of it, runt!

46
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,541
[PETRA] You can
puzzle it all out later.

47
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,083
Right now we need you
focused on pushing ahead.

48
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,541
Right!

49
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,916
Not quite yet, Levi.
A little more insurance.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,625
[ERWIN] Second and third waves!

51
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,583
Fire!

52
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,833
[ERWIN] All reserves!

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,583
[distant weapon fire]

[grunting]

55
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,333
They, uh-- They've
figured out how to climb.

56
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,583
I can see that. Well,
if they make it up this far

57
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,541
we can always go up a
little further, I suppose.

58
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,958
[NANABA] Anyway. I doubt
we'll be here much longer.

59
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,416
[NANABA] I suspect
the order to withdraw

60
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,750
will be coming any minute.

61
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,833
[CHRISTA] What
makes you say that?

62
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,583
[CHRISTA] Those
explosions just now?

63
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,833
[CHRISTA] I hope
everything's alright in there.

64
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,333
Me, too.

65
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,250
[SASHA] Mikasa. You think
that's cannon fire or what?

66
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,458
I mean, nothing else makes
that kind of racket, right?

67
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,625
[REINER] If that's the case,
why didn't we see them

68
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,083
[REINER] bring any cannons in?

69
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,958
What the hell's with
all the noise? Seriously.

70
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,750
Gimme a hand here, Bertholdt.

71
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,750
[YMIR] You happen see what
tree Christa scuttled up?

72
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,125
Sorry. I don't have a clue.

73
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,208
[CONNY] Nothing
makes sense anymore.

74
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,500
[CONNY] What are
we even doing here?

75
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,666
[CONNY] I just wanna go home.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,250
Whaddya say we
get outta the way?

77
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,250
[JEAN] Ugly bastard is
really gettin' the hang of it.

78
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,458
At this rate, he's
gonna try his hand

79
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,958
at buildin' a damn tree house.

80
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,375
The alarming thing is that
this shows that they can learn.

81
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,791
Not a pleasant thought.
Of course, they probably

82
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,541
[ARMIN] all develop
at different rates.

83
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,083
[JEAN] Hey, Armin. They
want us keeping these Titans

84
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,875
[JEAN] outta the forest right?

85
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,541
[JEAN] I think I
just figured out why.

86
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,333
[JEAN] We're here to lure
that Female Titan into a trap.

87
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,416
[JEAN] C'mon.
What else could it be?

88
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,333
[JEAN] It's like you said.

89
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,208
[JEAN] There's a person
inside it steerin' the thing.

90
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,375
[JEAN] Commander Erwin
wants to find out who.

91
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,500
[EREN] So that was
the plan from the start?

92
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,833
[EREN] We weren't flying
by the seat of our pants?

93
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,416
Look, I'm not complaining.
I get keeping it from me.

94
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,458
But, come on! Keeping
you guys in the dark?

95
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,750
You'd think you'd
earned a little more

96
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,958
trust than that, right?

97
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,541
Damn, you're annoying.

98
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,333
I hope you're not suggesting the
captain kept the plan from us

99
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,208
because he thinks
we're a liability!

100
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,750
[EREN] I'm sorry, but I am!

101
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,208
[EREN] There's just no
other way it makes sense!

102
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,666
[ORUO] Enough of this!

103
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,791
[ORUO] Petra! Knock the
teeth out of his skull!

104
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,916
Look, I hate to say it,
but he's got a point.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
[ORUO] Huh?

106
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,375
For being as
supposedly instrumental

107
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,708
to the plan as we were,

108
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,833
[ELD] the captain didn't
give us much to go on.

109
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,375
So, what?

110
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,250
[ELD] That means he doesn't
trust us. Kind of a big deal.

111
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,000
C'mon, you guys.
Think about it.

112
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,375
Maybe Eren isn't the
only one who can change.

113
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,333
[ELD] Maybe someone in
the regiment's a Titan spy.

114
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:14,333
It's the only way all
the pieces fit. You with me?

115
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,916
Yeah. Best explanation.

116
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,791
[GUNTHER] A spy?
Are you sure about that?

117
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,208
[ELD] Well, no. But I'm sure
the commander believes it.

118
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,166
He'd have to. And
I'll wager you anything

119
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,833
the only people
in the know on this

120
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,166
were the survivors
from five years ago.

121
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,375
[GUNTHER] Of course.
That's got to be it.

122
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,541
I concur whole-heartedly.
Hear that, Snivel-drop?

123
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,125
There was a good reason.

124
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,125
Right. Yes. A
perfectly good reason.

125
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,125
It adds up. After
all, in their position,

126
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,875
it's the best way of
narrowing down the list

127
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,083
of suspects to a
manageable number.

128
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,208
[PETRA] Shiganshina's
probably when the spy got in.

129
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,208
So, you think this
person's responsible

130
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,666
for killing Sawney and Beane?

131
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,291
Possibly. In fact,
after it happened,

132
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,625
the commander asked
me this odd question.

133
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,958
What is it you think you see?

134
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,416
Who do you think
the real enemy is here?

135
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,041
So that's what
he meant. Of course.

136
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,250
[ELD] If we'd known the
answer to that question,

137
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,708
he probably would've let us
in on what was happening today.

138
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,250
Though, there again, I really
don't think any of us could've.

139
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,000
[ORUO] Speak for yourself,
my friend. I knew.

140
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,250
I just decided to
keep my own counsel.

141
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,166
Doubtless you appreciate
the reason for my silence.

142
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,875
[PETRA] Which would be?

143
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,541
[ORUO] Oh, come now. Surely
you all know? Dear oh dear.

144
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,541
[ORUO] Perhaps I've
said too much already.

145
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,833
[ORUO] Well,
one day, when you've

146
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,958
[ORUO] reached my
level of expertise...

147
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,333
Look, we all get that you like
to pretend you're Captain Levi.

148
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,333
[PETRA] But that's
not how he sounds.

149
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,333
[EREN] If we pull this off,

150
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,750
[EREN] we might learn
what the Titans are all about.

151
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,041
[EREN] But, even for that...

152
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,750
[EREN] was it worth
letting so many people die?

153
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,875
You think the
commander was wrong

154
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,708
to leave us out of the loop?

155
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,125
Well he certainly
wasn't in the right.

156
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,916
Why put so many
of our lives at risk

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,416
just because one
of us can't be trusted?

158
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,791
Hell, we could've
smoked out the spy.

159
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,166
Maybe saved some good people.

160
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,458
No. He did what was necessary.

161
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,500
Are you seriously
trying to defend him?

162
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,708
Do you know
how many of us died

163
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,291
so the commander
could play intrigue?

164
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,375
[ARMIN] Of course
I do. All I'm saying

165
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,375
[ARMIN] is it's easy
to judge in hindsight.

166
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,208
[ARMIN] At the time, though,

167
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,541
there was no way to know
how things would turn out.

168
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,291
He's a commander,
not a soothsayer.

169
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,208
He had to act on
what he had. Period.

170
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:51,458
[ARMIN] He had to choose: a
handful of us, or all of us?

171
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,583
[ARMIN] What
would you have done?

172
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,916
He made a decision. He
sacrificed a hundred lives

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,833
for the good of mankind.

174
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,958
Eren, I can understand why
you still have your doubts,

175
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,458
but in time you'll come to
realize, just like we all did,

176
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,208
why Erwin Smith was
entrusted to lead the Scouts

177
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,458
and carry humanity's hope.

178
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,583
Or why even someone as cagey
as Captain Levi can trust him.

179
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,291
Indeed. Live long enough

180
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,416
and you'll understand
the weight of it.

181
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,416
[ARMIN] I may be naive but,

182
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,833
there's one thing I
know beyond all doubt.

183
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,875
Genuine harbingers of
change must be able to

184
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,125
do what others won't dare.
Sacrifice their heart.

185
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,875
Accept the burden of
doing the unspeakable.

186
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,625
[ARMIN] Whether we like to admit
it or not, the fact is this:

187
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,708
[ARMIN] To rise above monsters,
we have to abandon our humanity.

188
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,208
[ARMIN] That's
the irony, really.

189
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,583
If you can't let it go,
it's not worth holding on to.

190
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,416
Fire!

191
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,000
[HANGE] Poor thing.

192
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,375
[HANGE] Can't so much
as bat an eyelash, can we?

193
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,583
[HANGE] Must be
terribly frustrating.

194
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,791
[HANGE] Get
used to it, my dear.

195
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,416
Heh. Biology can
often times be a curse.

196
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,125
Case in point, the
more your wounds heal,

197
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,041
the stiffer
your joints become.

198
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,083
[Hange chuckling]

199
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,541
[HANGE] Now what in the world
is the hold-up on the extraction

200
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,541
of our esteemed guest?
It won't get any easier.

201
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,083
[HANGE] Strike while
the iron is hot, I say!

202
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,375
[ERWIN] An impressive ability.
So she can harden her skin

203
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,458
[ERWIN] to protect
portions of her body.

204
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,916
[ERWIN] Similar to the
one who rushed Wall Maria.

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,541
[ERWIN] The Armored Titan,
I believe they called him.

206
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,666
[ERWIN] The question is,
how many blade strikes

207
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,541
[ERWIN] would it take to
finally chip our way through?

208
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,166
[ERWIN] Too many, in
any event. Time is short.

209
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,250
Yes, sir?

210
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,666
Prepare an artillery round.
I want her hands blown off.

211
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,083
With all due
respect, Commander,

212
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,875
there's a risk if we
use the cannons.

213
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,166
The hands will get blown off,

214
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,416
but whatever's beneath
them will too, sir.

215
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,541
[ERWIN] A fine point,
soldier. Which is why

216
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,916
[ERWIN] you'll aim carefully
and sever them at the wrists.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,625
On my signal I want
an all-out salvo.

218
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,083
[SOLDIER] Yes, sir!

219
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,250
[LEVI] Knock knock.
We know you're in there.

220
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,291
[LEVI] Why don't you make
this easy and come on out.

221
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,416
[LEVI] Stop wasting our time.

222
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,333
[LEVI] Seriously, what can
you hope to gain by stalling?

223
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,583
[LEVI] If you're thinking
we'll let you go, we won't.

224
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,375
[LEVI] If you're thinking
about trying to escape, don't.

225
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,500
All you should
be thinking about

226
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,750
are the good men
you killed today.

227
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,166
[LEVI] Not that you would.

228
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,875
[LEVI] That's not your
style, is it? Remorse.

229
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,000
[LEVI] You enjoy killing.

230
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,958
Which means we have
something in common.

231
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,541
'Course, I enjoy
killing Titans.

232
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,083
But it's a start.

233
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,458
I'm sure we can still
find some middle ground.

234
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,000
[LEVI] Oh, that's right.

235
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,250
[LEVI] While we're on
that subject, let me ask.

236
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,291
You're okay with me cuttin' your
limbs off at the joints, right?

237
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,375
[LEVI] I mean,
they'll grow back.

238
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,833
[LEVI] I'm talking
about your actual body.

239
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,583
[LEVI] Don't want
you dead just yet.

240
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,875
[LEVI] Timing wouldn't work.

241
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:54,083
[Female Titan roaring]

242
00:13:54,166 --> 00:14:04,833
[Female Titan roaring]

243
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,833
Nicely done. I almost
lost my composure.

244
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,541
Were those like, death
throes or something?

245
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,125
[MICHE] They're coming.
I can smell them.

246
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,208
From what direction?

247
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,083
From every direction.
Fast. Dozens.

248
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,583
What the hell is this?
They-- They're all going in!

249
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,083

us all've a sudden?

250
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,208
Oh no.

00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,000
You-- You tellin' me
they're all Abnormals?

252
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,666
Who cares? Concentrate
on pushing 'em back!

253
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,250
[ELITE] Engage!

254
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,875
[MIKASA] What's
going on over there?

255
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,458
[SASHA] Wait! Please!

256
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,333
I know that sound.
It used to haunt my sleep.

257
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,375
I'd hear it from the
forest in the dead of night.

258
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,375
Believe me, nothing in
the world screams like that

259
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,083
except a dying animal.
It's the sound of a creature

260
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,541
who knows it's got
absolutely nothing to lose.

261
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,625
It's alright, I
know to be careful.

262
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,583
That is not the
right attitude to have!

263
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,416
You can't just be careful,
you have to be terrified!

264
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,708
Have you ever seen me
terrified of anything?

265
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,625
No! And I'm tellin' ya this'd
be a good time to try it out!

266
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,875
Right.

267
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,375
[MIKASA] I have
to give her credit.

268
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,250
[MIKASA] The girl's instincts

[MIKASA] Eren's in
the center rank, I think.

[MIKASA] That's what Armin said.

00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,000
[PETRA] Then where would we be?

337
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,291
[ORUO] Oh, please.

338
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,708
[ORUO] Why don't you stroke
his forehead while you're at it.

339
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,583
[ORUO] We'd be
exactly where we are now,

340
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,791
without of course having had
to endure his incessant whining.

341
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,291
Don't wait for me
to decorate your path

342
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,166
in pink and white rose petals.
Survive the journey home

343
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,875
and I might be
persuaded to respect you.

344
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,375
The mission isn't over.

345
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,083
Not 'til we're
though the gates.

346
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,500
[ORUO] Do you understand?

347
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,416
Yes, sir. I
completely understand.

348
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,166
Oruo! Petra! I gotta
hand it to ya both.

349
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,291
For someone who wet
themselves first time out,

350
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,583
[ELD] you've come a long way.

351
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,708
[screaming]

352
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,875
I thought we agreed
never to speak of it again!

353
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,958
[EREN] Whoa. Seriously?

354
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,375
Relax. Incidentally, I've never
once pissed myself in battle.

355
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,666
[ORUO] How dare you! I have
the highest kill-count

356
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,625
of anyone on the
damn squad! Argh! Imbecile!

357
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,625
[ELD] You wanna hide that
stain behind your kill-counts,

358
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,041
be my guest.

359
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,291
Shut your hole!

360
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,875
[EREN] So did it, like,
rain down on everyone

361
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,291
[EREN] midair, or what?

362
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,875
[GUNTHER] Enough! No one
cares who pissed who's pants!

363
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,958
Focus on the job at hand!

364
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,000
For the record, my
shorts've always been dry.

365
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,291
Huh?

366
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,000
[GUNTHER] Must be a signal
from the captain himself.

367
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,750
Stow the chatter
'til we're home.

368
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,083
We'll rendezvous
with Levi shortly.

369
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,000
[HANGE] Erwin. Why bother
having him replenish?

370
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,583
There's no time.

371
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,958
We saw the Female
Titan get eaten.

372
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,333
Did we actually see the person
inside suffer the same fate?

373
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,666
[ERWIN] I didn't.

374
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,541
[gasp] You mean...?

375
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,083
[ERWIN] Yes. Your hypothesis
is correct. This isn't over.

376
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,083
We're dealing
with someone like Eren.

377
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,166
[ERWIN] Someone who regenerates
in and out of Titan form.

378
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,083
Suppose that person
equipped themselves

379
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,166
[ERWIN] with
ODM gear in advance.

380
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,958
[ERWIN] Suppose further
that they're also disguised

381
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,541
[ERWIN] in one
of our uniforms?

382
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,541
[ERWIN] What would
their next move be?

383
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,708
[GUNTHER] Captain Levi?

384
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,541
Wait, that--
That's not-- Oh shit!

385
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,916
[all gasp]

386
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,583
[EREN] Gunther! You
okay? What happened?

387
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,041
[EREN] Talk to me!

388
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,000
[gasp]

389
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,791
[ERWIN] How do you
ferret out the enemy...

390
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,583
[ERWIN] when they're
one of your own?

391
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,666
[NARRATOR] Erwin's
plan has backfired.

392
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,375
[NARRATOR] The dreaded Female
Titan comes for Eren yet again.

393
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,000
[NARRATOR] But between
her and her quarry

394
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,000
[NARRATOR] stands a team
of expert Titan slayers.

395
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,500
[NARRATOR] The
Special Operations Squad.
