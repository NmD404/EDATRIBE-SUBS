1
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,416
Hey, Mop-Top!

2
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,416
Sir!

3
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,000
[KEITH] What do they
call you, maggot?

4
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,541
[ARMIN] Armin Arlelt,
from Shinganshina, sir!

5
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,125
Wow, seriously?
Why would your parents

6
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,791
curse you with
such a dumb name?

7
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,666
[ARMIN] It was
my grandfather, sir!

8
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,166
Cadet Arlelt! Why is
a runt like you here?

9
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,708
To help humanity
overcome the Titans!

10
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,250
That is delightful to hear!

11
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,291
You're gonna be a
great light snack for him!

12
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,791
Row Three, About Face, runt!

13
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,208
What do you call yourself?

14
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:24,125
Sir. My name is Thomas Wagner,
I'm from the Trost district!

15
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,458
I can't hear you!

16
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,750
[THOMAS] I'm from
Trost, sir, my name--

17
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,958
Look at him go.
The man is a master

18
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,250
when it comes to
fresh-faced recruits.

19
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,791
That takes me back.

20
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,833
Is a pathetic worm like you
the best Karaness has to offer?

21
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,083
Sir! I'm afraid
that's the case, sir!

22
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,291
Tell your backwoods--

23
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,708
But what's the point
of all the intimidation?

24
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,958
It's a Rite of Passage.
Through stress and denigration

25
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,625
we revert them
into blank slates.

26
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,041
From there, we can mold them
bit by bit into proper soldiers.

27
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,500
He is the first
step in that process.

28
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,916
We seem to really excel
at that back home, sir!

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
[KEITH] Row Four, About Face!

30
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,500
[YOUNG INSTRUCTOR] There
are some he's passing by.

31
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,875
[INSTRUCTOR] A drill instructor
is nothing compared to

32
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,083
[INSTRUCTOR] what those
recruits have seen.

33
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,208
[INSTRUCTOR] They were there.
Witnesses to the hell of

34
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,708
[INSTRUCTOR] the Titan
attack two years ago.

35
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,833
[INSTRUCTOR] You can
read it in their faces.

36
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,916
[INSTRUCTOR] C'mon. Let's go.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,541
What do we have over here?

38
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,958
Jean Kirschtein, sir.
From the Trost District!

39
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,250
And why're you here, cadet?

40
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,833
To join the Military Police,
sir. The best of the best.

41
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,958
[KEITH] That's nice. You want
to live in the interior, do you?

42
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,916
Yes!

43
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,750
[KEITH] No one told
you to sit, Recruit!

44
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,250
If you can't handle
this, Kirschtein,

45
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,083
then forget about
joining the Military Police!

46
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,208
What the hell is wrong with
your face, you smiling idiot?

47
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,208
Marco Bodt at your
service, sir, from Jinae.

48
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,916
South side of Wall Rose. I aim
to join the Military Police

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,541
and give life and limb
in service to the king!

50
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:53,875
Well then. That makes you
an idealistic fool. And a rube.

51
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,333
[KEITH] You want the truth?

52
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,833
The only use the king has for

53
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,958
your life and limbs
are as Titan fodder.

54
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey, Cue-ball. You're up next!

55
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, me? Sir! Conny Springer,
from Ragako village, sir!

56
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,458
You have it backwards,
Conny Springer.

57
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,416
That was the first
thing you were taught.

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,791
This salute
represents the resolve

59
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,083
in your heart to
fight those bent on

60
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,541
the systematic
destruction of our people!

61
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,583
Is your heart
on your right side?

62
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,250
[chewing]

63
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,958
Hey, you there. What
do you think you're doing?

64
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:39,958
[chewing]

65
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,875
You are officially
on my shit list.

66
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,416
Just who in the hell are you?

67
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,458
[swallow]

68
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,458
Sasha Braus from Dauper
village, at your service.

69
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,833
Reporting for duty, sir!

70
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,791
Sasha Braus, huh?

71
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,791
And what is that you're
clutching in your right hand?

72
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,541
A steamed potato!

73
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,875
It sat there in the mess
hall begging to be eaten. Sir!

74
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,750
The theft, I understand.

75
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,791
But here? Why eat
it here of all places?

76
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,875
It looked quite delicious.
And it was getting cold.

77
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,583
So I gave it shelter
in my stomach, sir.

78
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:20,000
Why? I can't comprehend.
Why would you eat that potato?

79
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,166
Are you asking me
why people eat potatoes?

80
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,041
I'm surprised
you don't know, sir.

81
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,458
Here sir. Have half.

82
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,291
"Have half?" Really?

83
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,916
Man, I thought Sadies
was gonna kill Potato Girl.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,500
I know. What a
helluva first day.

85
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,708
[EREN] It's funny. Being
told to run 'til the sun sets

86
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,416
[EREN] didn't seem to
bother her nearly as much as

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,458
[EREN] losing meal privileges
for the next five days.

88
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,208
I think she said
that she's from Dauper.

89
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,250
If I remember right,
that's a small hunting village

90
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,375
up in the mountains.

91
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,208
Hey, what's that?

92
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,666
[MINA] They're dropouts. They'd
prefer to work in the fields.

93
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,166
[ARMIN] But. It's
only the first day.

94
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,750
[EREN] That's the way it is.

95
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,791
[EREN] If you can't handle the
pressure, you've gotta leave.

96
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,500
I can't believe anyone would
rather pull plants than fight.

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,250
I know about some of us,
but you never mentioned

98
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,041
where you were from, Eren.

99
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,041
The same as Armin.
From Shinganshina.

100
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,750
Oh, wow. That means.

101
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,125
You saw it. You
were there that day.

102
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,333
Huh? Quiet!

103
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,875
The Colossal one?
Did you see him?

104
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,291
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

105
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,750
Yeah, okay? I saw the big guy.

106
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,416
Whoa, seriously?

107
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,458
Okay, exactly how tall was he?

108
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,500
He stuck his head
over the outer wall.

109
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,416
Whoa, wait! I heard he stepped
over the wall completely.

110
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,583
So did I!

111
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,541
That was the rumor
in my village, too!

112
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,166
Nah. He was big,
but not that big.

113
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,291
So what did it look like?

114
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,916
It had a mouth like a corpse.
And no skin, just muscles.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,333
And the Armored Titan? The one
that broke through Wall Maria?

116
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,583
Is that what they're
calling it? In all the panic,

117
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,875
[EREN] it was just
another Titan to me.

118
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,291
No way. So,
what were they like?

119
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,541
C'mon. That's enough questions,
alright? I'm sure he'd rather

120
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,500
not relive everything
he went through.

121
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,083
Sorry. We didn't mean to--

122
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,708
[EREN] It's not like that!

123
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,250
[chewing]

124
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,875
Those stupid Titans. They're
really not that big of a deal.

125
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,833
If we focus on mastering the
Omni-Directional Mobility Gear

126
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,208
they give us, then
it's Titan payback time!

127
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,291
[EREN] I've waited years
to be trained as a soldier.

128
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,083
[EREN] All of a sudden,
the reality is sinking in.

129
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,541
I'm joining the Scout
Regiment. Then I'm sending

130
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,000
the Titans back to hell.
I'm gonna butcher them all.

131
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,458
[JEAN] Hey, are you
crazy or something?

132
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,041
Not that it's my
business, but signing up

133
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,458
for reconnaissance is
like a death sentence.

134
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,958
I guess we'll see.
Or at least I will.

135
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,083
You seem content hiding
in the interior with the MPs.

136
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,625
Look, I'm just speaking
honestly here, kid.

137
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,416
I think it's better
than being some loud mouthed

138
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,375
braggart tough-guy
wannabe pretending

139
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,166
he's not as piss-scared
as the rest of us.

140
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,833
Are you trying to pick a fight?

141
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,291
[MARCO] Stop it you guys!

142
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,666
Alright, sure. Makes
no difference to me.

143
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,875
[BOTH] Huh?

144
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,083
Hey. I apologize.
Sorry for calling you names

145
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,458
and dismissing
your choice of career.

146
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,875
Put 'er there,
kid. Whaddaya say?

147
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,791
Right. Yeah, I'm sorry as well.

148
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,125
[JEAN] Umm. Excuse me?

149
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:19,333
I-- Uh. I just
wanted-- I mean.

150
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,416
I've never seen anyone
like you before. I mean, uh.

151
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,708
I'm-- I'm sorry. You have
really beautiful black hair.

152
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,250
Thank you.

153
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,958
Would you lay off?
It's no big deal!

154
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,291
It's just that
you get so worked up

155
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,333
you don't think things through.

156
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,833
Again with this?

157
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,500
[EREN] If you
insist on worrying,

158
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,500
[EREN] worry about
how long your hair is.

159
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,041
[EREN] It's gonna catch
up with you in a bad way

160
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,208
[EREN] when we
start on the ODMs.

161
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,083
Okay, fine. I'll cut it.

162
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,583
[MIKASA] How short
should I go, do you think?

163
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,375
[humming]

164
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,041
What the hell? Leave
my clothes alone, dammit!

165
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,958
[CONNY] What did you wipe on me?

166
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Don't worry. Just my trust.

167
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,875
I'm... finished.

168
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:26,750
[wheezing]

169
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,916
[sniffing]

170
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,458
[shriek]

171
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,708
Could it be? It's bread!

172
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,583
I'm sorry there isn't
more. It's all I could take.

173
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,041
Hey, hang on. You really should
drink a little water first.

174
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:57,333
You-- You're a Goddess,
aren't you? Glory unto you!

175
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,333
Hey. Just what are
you two girls up to?

176
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, uh. She's been running all
day. Without any food or water.

177
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,416
I see. So you're
trying to be "nice," huh?

178
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,583
Eh?

179
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,708
What's the point of breakin'
the rules for Potato Girl?

180
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,791
That mindless act of kindness
gets you absolutely nowhere.

181
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,375
Whatever.

182
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,166
[YMIR] Let's just
get her to bed already.

183
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,458
I'm confused.
Are you being nice?

184
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,625
I'm helping her so that she'll
owe me one in the future.

185
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,833
I intend to make
use of her stupidity.

186
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,291
It's aptitude test
time, so listen up!

187
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,708
There is no place for you
here if you cannot perform!

188
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,250
Fail, and be shipped
to the fields.

189
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,500
[INSTRUCTOR] We're just
drilling the fundamentals here.

190
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,125
You can still determine
a Cadet's knack

191
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,875
for it just by watching.

192
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,708
Like her. Completely steady.

193
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,291
[INSTRUCTOR] She
inherently knows what to do,

194
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,250
[INSTRUCTOR] and how
to make it happen.

195
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,333
[INSTRUCTOR] That's what
aptitude is all about.

196
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,458
[INSTRUCTOR] I'd
say we have several

197
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,208
[INSTRUCTOR] capable
cadets this year.

198
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,041
And what about this guy?

199
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,833
That's precisely
why we run these tests.

200
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,000
He proves that drive
and dedication do not

201
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,750
[INSTRUCTOR] always
translate into capability.

202
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,583
What is your major
malfunction, Jaeger?

203
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,375
Straighten yourself up!

204
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,625
[snickering]

205
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,000
[EREN] Why am I--
How do I work this thing?

206
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,041
This can't be happening!

207
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,916
Just remember the basics
and you should be fine.

208
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,083
No need to try
any fancy maneuvers.

209
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,541
Just focus on your balance.

210
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,291
Then distribute your
weight evenly between

211
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,708
the belts on your
waist and your legs.

212
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,500
Loosen up your
stance a little bit.

213
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,708
If I could do it,
I know that you can!

214
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,708
Okay. A loose
stance, but balanced.

215
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,458
Let's give it a shot, Armin.

216
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,791
Hey, Daz. He was talking big
about butchering all the Titans,

217
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,125
but he got real quiet after
ODM training, didn't he?

218
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,916
I guess it's the fields
for him tomorrow.

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,541
Can't keep wasting
food on the useless.

220
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,708
Eren.

221
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,333
[ARMIN] Worrying
won't solve a thing.

222
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,000
[ARMIN] There's still time
to get some practice in

223
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,333
[ARMIN] come morning.

224
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,250
[EREN] How pathetic. How
am I supposed to kill 'em

225
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,958
[EREN] if I can't
even stand up straight?

226
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,250
[MIKASA] It might be
time to let that dream die.

227
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,333
Whaddaya mean?

228
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,250
I think you should give up
this attempt to be a soldier.

229
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,083
There's a lot more
to fighting and combat

230
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,500
than just throwing
your life away in vain.

231
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,083
What're you saying? After
everything we saw that day,

232
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,666
after what happened to my mom.

233
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,708
You're crazy if you think
I'm just going to walk away.

234
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,083
I get it. But it doesn't
matter how determined you are.

235
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,125
It-- Wait, what do you mean?

236
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,291
Because whether or not

237
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,708
you're fit to be a
soldier isn't up to you.

238
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,000
You misunderstand.
I'm not saying you should

239
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,375
return to the
fields by yourself.

240
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,416
I wouldn't dream of it.

241
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,625
Because wherever you go.
I'm gonna go with you--

242
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,291
[SASHA] So. Uh.
Are you saying...

243
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,000
[SASHA] that you're not
going to finish that?

244
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,583
[CONNY] What's the trick to
posture control? Hard to say.

245
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,250
Guess I got the "gift". You've
just gotta feel it, y'know?

246
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,291
I'm trying to
figure out your trick.

247
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,125
You've screwed
upevery way imaginable,

248
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,416
short of an accidental
equipment-related asphyxiation.

249
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,125
Please guys. You gotta
help me, I'm begging you!

250
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,750
That's funny. Wasn't
it just yesterday you said

251
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,625
"if you can't handle the
pressure, you gotta leave?"

252
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,166
[CONNY] No, wait. Or was it
"if you're a complete idiot,

253
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,375
you gotta leave?"
Something like that.

254
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,375
Oh, come on.

255
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,541
I heard from everyone
you're both really good at it!

256
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,208
[EREN] Bertholdt! Reiner!

257
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,625
Sorry kid. But there
isn't any special trick

258
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,208
to just hanging there.
Not to be harsh,

259
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,500
but if it's advice you want,
I'm not really the guy.

260
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,958
Alright.

261
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,708
[ARMIN] Let's just hope
it comes to you tomorrow.

262
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,500
Hold on. Aren't the two of you
originally from Shiganshina?

263
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,375
Yeah, that's right.

264
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,375
Then you know first-hand
how terrifying they are.

265
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,333
Why on earth would
you want to be soldiers?

266
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,375
I didn't see
the things. Eren did.

267
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,791
He saw their
bloodlust first hand,

268
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,541
before anyone realized
how bad it was.

269
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,208
And I-- I knew I couldn't sit
idly by as the royal government

270
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,333
forced the citizenry
into the failed

271
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,083
territory retrieval operation.

272
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,208
[BERTHOLDT] I see.

273
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,833
So where are
the two of you from?

274
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,958
Oh, Reiner and I? We were
both from a mountain village

275
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,000
just Southeast of Wall Maria.

276
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,166
But. Then that means.

277
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,083
[BERTHOLDT] Yeah. Unlike the
more prosperous river towns,

278
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,833
[BERTHOLDT] our village
didn't receive word right away.

279
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,208
[BERTHOLDT]
The Titans were on us

280
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,083
[BERTHOLDT] before we
even knew what was going on.

281
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:51,875
It happened at dawn. All the
livestock were so restless.

282
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,958
Soon after, we heard
these strange rumblings

283
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,375
that just became
louder and louder.

284
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,000
[BERTHOLDT] Eventually, I
realized those rumblings were

285
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,958
[BERTHOLDT] the sound of
death getting closer. I, uh...

286
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,333
[BERTHOLDT] I looked
out my window, and--

287
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:18,166
After that, well, uh.
Everything is just a blur.

288
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,375
I think we all just panicked.

289
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,666
Hey. Easy now.

290
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,750
You're just getting
yourself worked up again.

291
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:28,375
Sorry. Basically, what I've
been trying to say is this.

292
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:32,416
The four of us aren't
like the rest of-- of them.

293
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,666
"Them" who?

294
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,833
The others here who've never

295
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,083
been witness to
the Titan's horror.

296
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,583
Hey.

297
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:42,750
[chattering and laughter]

298
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,291
[BERTHOLDT] Most of
them are here for show.

299
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,416
To do just what
society expects.

300
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,583
In a world where you're
labeled a coward if you choose

301
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,541
fieldwork by the
time you turn twelve,

302
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,041
propriety demands our service.

303
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:02,583
With that said, I'm really
no different from the others.

304
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,458
[BERTHOLDT] I joined the
ranks hoping for assignment to

305
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,208
[BERTHOLDT] the Military Police.
Tucked away in the Interior.

306
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,958
[BERTHOLDT] If that doesn't
work out, I'll give up entirely.

307
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:15,125
[BERTHOLDT] I don't really have
the fortitude for anything else.

308
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,083
[ARMIN] There's no
shame in caring about

309
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,166
[ARMIN] your life,
Bertholdt. We all do.

310
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,333
Do we?

311
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,875
[REINER] I'm going
to return to the home

312
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,500
[REINER] that was taken from me.
That's all I care about now.

313
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,000
I will do it. No matter what.

314
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:40,833
[BERTHOLDT] What about
you? Why did you sign up?

315
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,875
Why'd I join?

316
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,208
I decided I have to kill them.

317
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,083
[EREN] I won't stop
'til every single

318
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,541
[EREN] Titan is
dead and rotting.

319
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,500
Dead. Every last one.

320
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,416
[REINER] You saw what those
monsters are capable of,

321
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,208
[REINER] and you still
want to take them on?

322
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:12,250
[EREN] Damn right. It's just,
after screwing up the training,

323
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,083
[EREN] I don't know if
I'm cut out to be a soldier.

324
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,583
[REINER] We'll take it from
step one: Belt Adjustment.

325
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,750
[REINER] By tomorrow,
you'll be an expert.

326
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,875
I know you've got what it
takes. I can see it in you.

327
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,375
Am I wrong here?

328
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:49,375
No! I won't fail. Thank you,
Reiner. Thank you.

329
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,625
Eren Jaeger. Are you ready?

330
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:07,291
[EREN] Yes sir! I'm
going to do it. I have to!

331
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,416
[EREN] I may not be
as talented as the rest.

332
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,416
[EREN] But nobody,
nobody, has more guts!

333
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,041
Proceed!

334
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:27,583
[EREN] The moment of truth. I
won't fail again. To hell with

335
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,166
[EREN] working the damn
fields! I'm not giving up.

336
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,208
[EREN] Not without a fight!

[cheering]

338
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,083
[EREN] I did it?
No, I'm doing it!

[gasp]

340
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,000
No! Not yet!

341
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,666
Once more! I can do it!

342
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,625
Lower him.

343
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,041
I-- I'm finished.

344

Wagner! Please exchange
belts with Mr. Jaeger.

345
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,583
Huh? Yes sir!

346
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,541
[KEITH] Your equipment
was defective.

347
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,291
If given a piece of
functional gear,

348
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,208
you might not be
worthless after all.

349
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,083
[KEITH] Quartermaster didn't
notice this broken clasp.

350
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,666
[KEITH] Might have to
visit the Supply Depot

351
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,583
[KEITH] and crack
a couple skulls.

352
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,166
He-- He still did it. Even while
wearing that busted gear.

353
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,083
Amazing.

354
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,250
So, you mean I--
I didn't wash out?

355
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,333
You made the cut.
Now keep training, cadet!

356
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,583
[EREN] I did it.
I really did it!

357
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,625
[EREN] Check it out,
Mikasa! I'm doing it!

358
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,750
[EREN] I can fight the Titans!

359
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,125
[EREN] You don't
have to worry about me!

360
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,583
[EREN] Not anymore!

361
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,958
It seems like
things worked out for him.

362
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,583
Look, his eyes are
saying "check me out!"

363
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,708
They're not.

364
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:10,375
His eyes are saying he doesn't
have to leave me. Not anymore.

365
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,875
[KEITH] Grisha. Today
should bring you pride.

366
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,708
