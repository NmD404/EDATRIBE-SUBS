1
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,291
[ANNIE] You know, Armin.

2
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:23,125
[ANNIE] It's nice that I could
be a "good person" for you.

3
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:27,250
[ANNIE] For now, at least, it
looks like you won your bet.

4
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,750
[ANNIE] But--

5
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,416
I'm going to gamble,
too. And here's my wager!

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,875
[Armin grunts]

7
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,791
[soldiers grunt]

8
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,958
[ALL] Uh!

9
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,000
[Eren gasp]

10
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,333
[shaky breath]

11
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,416
[ERWIN] We believe
we've uncovered the

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,333
[ERWIN] Female
Titan's true identity.

13
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,500
[ERWIN] She's one of us.

14
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,000
[EREN] Annie...

15
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,958
[LEVI] What's the hold up?

16
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,833
Erwin's never late.

17
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,875
They should be here.

18
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,416
At this rate the
damn MPs'll show up first.

19
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,208
That'd be our luck.

20
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,041
Yeah, who can say?

21
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,125
Maybe they're all takin'
a shit. Duty calls, right?

22
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,791
[Eren chuckles]

23
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,625
You're, uh, sure in
a talkative mood today.

24
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,291
[LEVI] So what if I am?

25
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,500
[LEVI] Doesn't mean
I was talkin' to you.

26
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:21,041
[Levi wincing]

27
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,666
It's my fault, sir.
I made the choice.

28
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,375
If I'd have thought
this through none of this--

29
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,875
[EREN] We wouldn't--

30
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,875
[LEVI] You made
a judgment call.

31
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,500
[LEVI] Look, no one expects
you to be clairvoyant.

32
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,791
[door opening]

33
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,708
[foot steps]

34
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,208
[ERWIN] Sorry to
keep you waiting.

35
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,375
Sir. [gasp]

36
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,041
[EREN] What the--?

37
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,250
Why-- Why are you all here?

38
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,416
[ERWIN] We believe
we've uncovered

39
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,416
[ERWIN] the Female
Titan's true identity.

40
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,375
She won't slip away this time.

41
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,291
[ERWIN] The day after tomorrow,
we'll be passing through

42
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,541
[ERWIN] Stohess District
en route to the capital.

43
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,500
[ERWIN] That's
when we'll strike.

44
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,250
[ERWIN] It'll be our first
and only chance to do so.

45
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,833
[ERWIN] Once we've
set foot in the interior,

46
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,708
[ERWIN] the government
will assume custody of Eren,

47
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,916
[ERWIN] and the Scouts'
authority to continue operations

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,583
[ERWIN] will be limited.

49
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:21,000
Thus, unless we
wish to concede defeat...

50
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,833
we must flush
out the enemy now.

51
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,666
So here's what we do.

52
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,458
[ERWIN] While in Stohess,
we use Eren as bait,

53
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:34,000
[ERWIN] luring the target
into this underground passage.

54
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,833
The deeper, the better. Get
her well beneath street level.

55
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,916
[ERWIN] That done, she
should be easily immobilized,

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,791
[ERWIN] even in Titan form.

57
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,666
[ERWIN] If she transforms
before reaching the tunnel,

58
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,916
[ERWIN] well, at
that point she'll be

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,791
[ERWIN] your
responsibility, Eren.

60
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,791
Right. So we know
she'll be in Stohess?

61
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,375
There's no chance she'll
bolt before we get there?

62
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,666
[ERWIN] No. She
won't risk going AWOL.

63
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,166
Wait, you mean she's--

64
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,583
Armin, here, identified her.

65
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,916
She's an MP.
Likely responsible for

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,875
the deaths of
Hange's test subjects.

67
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,666
[ERWIN] And a fellow trainee
in the 104th Cadet Corps.

68
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,750
Wha--? You can't be serious.

69
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,541
I trained with her?

70
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,625
[ERWIN] I'm sorry,
but yes. She's one of us.

71
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,916
No. It can't be.

72
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,458
[ERWIN] Her name
is Annie Leonhart.

73
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,208
God...

74
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,000
[ARMIN] No.

75
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,583
Damn it! That ring!

76
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,375
She must've known
I was lying to her

77
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,875
from the very beginning!

78
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,833
She knew we were
leading her into a trap!

79
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,833
[ARMIN] I could've-- I should've
taken a different approach.

80
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,416
Save the "should've's"
for after we're out of this.

81
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,041
The question now
is what do we do next.

82
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,625
Okay. First we
rendezvous with Squad Three.

83
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,666
Then get the
hell above ground.

84
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,791
We-- We fight
her out in the open!

85
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,166
That means we're
switching to Plan B.

86
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,458
She's all yours, Eren!

87
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,916
Got it?

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
Yeah!

89
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,458
[MALE SQUAD MEMBER]
Over here!

90
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,708
[ARMIN] Squad Three!

91
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,083
Hey, what happened?
Is Plan A a no-go?

92
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,625
Afraid so, yes!

93
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,500
As of now we're going
with the backup option!

94
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,750
[ARMIN] She caved
in the ceiling!

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,208
We've got to pull
them out of there!

96
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,291
[MIKASA] Eren! Get back!

97
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,791
[EREN] What? No! Wait!

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,083
[MIKASA] What was that?

99
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,666
Does she not care
if she kills you, too?

100
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,791
[ARMIN] She took a chance.

101
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,500
It was risky, but she gambled
on Eren's being able to survive.

102
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,166
We're dealing with someone
who's been backed into a corner.

103
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,333
[ARMIN] She's desperate.
That makes her

104
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,416
[ARMIN] all the more dangerous!

105
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,791
[ARMIN] Damn it. We're cut off.
If we try to get airborne

106
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,041
[ARMIN] with our ODM gear,
she'll swat us like flies.

107
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,500
[ARMIN] And if we--

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,125
[ARMIN] If we stay here,
it's only a matter of time

109
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,833
[ARMIN] before we're crushed.

110
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,458
I know what I have
to do! I'll change!

111
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,208
[EREN] I'll shield you
guys just like that time

112
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,833
[EREN] with the cannon fire!

113
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,041
[EREN] Get in close!

114
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:46,833
[ARMIN] But--

115
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,291
Alright. Brace yourselves!

116
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,875
[Eren heavy breathing]

117
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:59,166
[Eren pained shouts]

118
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,958
Oh no! Not again!

119
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,583
Why now?

120
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:11,250
[EREN] We don't have time
for this. Just work, dammit!

121
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,250
Don't try to force it.
You have to have a clear goal

122
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,291
in mind like Hange said!

123
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,875
C'mon, you can do
this. We know you can!

124
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,333
Believe me! I'm trying!

125
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:28,041
[Eren in pain]

126
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,875
[Eren heavy breathing]

127
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,333
[MIKASA] Really?

128
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,500
Are you sure you're not
having second thoughts?

129
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,541
Doubts about Annie?

130
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,125
Eren.

131
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,791
It's her. The Female Titan.

132
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,625
No matter how much you
don't want to believe it,

133
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,000
that won't stop
it from being true.

134
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,583
What did we see?
Back there just now.

135
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,458
[MIKASA] She's
a murderer. Period.

136
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,750
[MIKASA]
This isn't complicated.

137
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,833
Get off my back dammit!
I'm not stalling for time!

138
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,750
[Eren grunting]

139
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,666
[EREN] You think it's Annie?

140
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,250
[EREN] Where's--

141
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,291
Where's your evidence? Tell me!

142
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,916
Obviously the
Female Titan knew

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,625
what you looked
like before she attacked.

144
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,750
[ARMIN] Plus, she
reacted to my use of

145
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,166
[ARMIN] your "Suicidal
Maniac" nickname,

146
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,791
[ARMIN] something only
our classmates would know.

147
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,333
[ARMIN] But the biggest
reason I suspect her

148
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,958
[ARMIN] is that I have
strong reason to believe

149
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,541
[ARMIN] she's the one who
killed Sawney and Beane.

150
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,125
You're kinda goin'
out on a limb there.

151
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,833
Killing two Titans at once
required a precision ODM strike.

152
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,541
It only makes sense
that the killer would've

153
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,166
used the gear they
were most familiar with.

154
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,291
But, there was that
whole equipment inspection.

155
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,541
Annie's totally checked out.

156
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,958
Except, the gear she
presented. Well, it--

157
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,291
[ARMIN] It wasn't
hers. It was Marco's.

158
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,583
[EREN] I don't understand.

159
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,791
[EREN] What's Marco
got to do with all this?

160
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,208
[ARMIN] It's unclear.

161
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,958
[EREN] Maybe you need
to get your eyes checked--

162
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,666
Eren. I know what I
saw, and the fact is--

163
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,416
Okay, we get it. Do you
have anything else on her?

164
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,333
Any sort of concrete evidence?

165
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,791
Nothing, sir.

166
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,958
There's the fact that she
looks like the Female Titan.

167
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,333
That's something, isn't it?

168
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,833
Really? What the
hell's wrong with you?

169
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,541
[EREN] What kind
of evidence is that?

170
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,458
So basically, we're
going after her without proof.

171
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,041
You're kidding me, right?

172
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,625
This is insane!
