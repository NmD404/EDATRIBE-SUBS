00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,208
[NARRATOR] In the year 850, the
Colossal Titan again appeared

00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,250
[NARRATOR] and decimated
yet another barrier

[NARRATOR] between us and them.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,958
[NARRATOR] Once more,
mankind retreated in panic

5
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,541
[NARRATOR] before the
advance of its greatest foe.

6
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,375
[NARRATOR] Brave soul
after brave soul perished.

7
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,125
[NARRATOR] Eaten alive.

00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,500
Eren! No!

[Armin screaming]

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,125
[NARRATOR] Eren, himself,
fell prey to their hunger.

11
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,791
[CONNY] Whoa,
Mikasa is a badass!

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,916
[CONNY] How is
she going so fast?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,750
[ARMIN] No! Mikasa's
using too much gas!

14
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,750
[MIKASA] I'll do
whatever it takes to win!

15
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,708
[MIKASA] Whatever
it takes to live!

16

[battle cry]

17
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,833
[NARRATOR] Just when things
seemed their darkest for Mikasa,

18
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:08,375
[NARRATOR] out of nowhere
came the unlikeliest of allies.

The ODM gear's functional.

00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,875
[ARMIN] And I restocked
your blades.

22
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,625
[ARMIN] Just-- Just
leave me this one, okay?

23
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,375
[ARMIN] It's just that...
I would rather this be my end,

24
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,125
[ARMIN] not being eaten alive.

25
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,625
Why'd you--?

26
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,125
[MIKASA] Armin.

27
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,000
I will not leave you behind.

28
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,541
[ARMIN] But-- I mean--
Titans are everywhere!

29
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,750
You can't jump and
carry me on your back at--

30
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,208
[CONNY] Come on. Let's move.

31
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:40,666
[ARMIN] Please. Don't do
this. It's not going to work.

32
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,916
[ARMIN[ Enough people
have died on my account.

[ARMIN] No!

36
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,833
[ARMIN] Hold on!
I've got an idea!

37
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,250
What is it then?

38
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,333
[ARMIN] Only you two are
capable of pulling this off,

39
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,833
[ARMIN] so it's
really your choice.

40
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:11,333
This may sound crazy, but
I think he might be useful.

41
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,875
Whoa, you mean the Titan?

42
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,958
[ARMIN] He only
attacks his own kind.

43
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,166
He seems to have
no interest in us.

44
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,625
What if we can
somehow steer him to HQ

45
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,583
and let him loose
on the other Titans?

46
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,541
Look, we know he's taken
at least one out already.

47
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,875
We can use him as a weapon!

48
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,250
You have got to be kidding!
How the hell you think

49
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,083
we're supposed
to steer that thing!

50
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,791
Well, something tells me
he's fighting on instinct.

51
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,750
I'm almost sure if you
take down the pair he's

52
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,083
tangling with now,
he'll go look for others.

53
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,041
That'd lead him straight to HQ.

54
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,458
[ARMIN] We're not steering
him so much as luring him.

55
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,375
[ARMIN] I think
it'll work. I really do.

56
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,625
Think? You're asking us to

57
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,833
risk our necks on
a stupid gut feeling?

58
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,083
If I'm right about this,
we can put down the siege

59
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,083
[ARMIN[ on headquarters
in one fell swoop!

60
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,375
[MIKASA] It's worth a shot.

61
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,375
Huh? Seriously?

62
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,541
Better to take a gamble
on Armin's gut feeling

63
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,375
than wait around
to be slaughtered.

64
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,333
If there's a decent
shot, why not take it?

65
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,916
[CONNY] So, basically we're
going to recruit a Titan?

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,958
[MIKASA] Yes. Exactly.

67
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,208
We'll look like morons
if we screw this up.

68
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,416
Yeah. But if we don't, look how
many lives we stand to save.

the Titans come within range,

171
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,208
[ARMIN] the group
fires in all four directions

172
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,375
[ARMIN] simultaneously,
blinding them.

173
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,083
Then the hard part.

174
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,291
[ARMIN] The moment
of truth, as it were.

175
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,791
[ARMIN] Before the
Titans have time to recover,

176
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,791
[ARMIN] seven of us
swoop down from the ceiling

177
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,041
[ARMIN] and strike
their vital regions.

178
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,166
[ARMIN] That's it.
That's the plan.

179
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,541
It puts all our
lives on the line--

180
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,375
We screw up, we're dead.
That's a hell of a risk

181
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,250
[ARMIN] for one attack,
but it's our only chance.

182
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,250
[ARMIN] Seven people
have to slay seven Titans

183
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,791
[ARMIN] in one blow,
at the same time.

184
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,916
We're gonna need the best of
you. The seven soldiers most

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,541
physically gifted and adept
with their paring blades.

186
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,541
You'll be the difference
between life and death

187
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,541
for the rest of us.
I'm sorry. That's how it is.

188
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,000
Seems like a sound plan.

189
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,416
When you get
right down to it,

190
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,000
the risk is the
same for everyone.

191
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,708
Doesn't really matter who goes.

192
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,708
Look, I-- I'm willing
to be talked out of this.

193
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,750
One half-baked strategy can't
be our only option, right?

194
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,666
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

195
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,208
C'mon, with what
we're looking at?

196
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,833
'Cause for our only option,
it's pretty well thought-out.

197
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,208
If we give it our all,
we might just pull this off!

198
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,958
It'll be fine. You just
have to be confident.

199
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,583
You're a better strategist than
you give yourself credit for.

200
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,000
[MIKASA] I'm serious.

201
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,875
That mind's saved Eren
and me more than once.

202
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,958
When did I ever
save you? That's not--

203
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,666
Alright, the lift's ready to go.
Guns are loaded to the stocks.

204
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,375
Let's go kill some Titans!

205
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,041
You didn't realize
it at the time.

206
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,833
We can talk about it later.

207
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,541
[CONNY] Okay. I'm gonna
ask the obvious question.

208
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,208
[CONNY] Can we do
this without ODM gear?

209
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,750
[REINER] No problem. These
guys are only four-meters tall.

210
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,208
[REINER] Their weak spots are
not too far above eye level.

211
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,000
[JEAN] He's right. Size won't be
an issue; the spot's still only

212
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,208
[JEAN] one meter high
and ten centimeters across.

213
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,166
[SASHA] Back 'o the head
to the nape o' the neck!

214
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,416
Worse comes to worst, you can
always just shove one of these

215
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,250
[REINER] up their ass.
That's the other weak spot.

216
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,250
Are you serious?
That's news to me!

217
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,083
Did I miss a day of
training or something?

218
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,833
[JEAN] Come on.
Knock it off, Reiner.

219
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,541
You want your final
words to be an ass joke?

220
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,083
[MARCO] Good.
We're still at seven.

221
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,333
Okay now, nice and easy.

222
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:49,416
[Titan footsteps]

223
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,375
Don't lose your cool!

224
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,833
Fire only when
they're all within range!

225
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,750
[MARCO] Steady.

226
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,958
[REINER] That's right;
wait for it.

227
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,666
[JEAN] Our lives
are riding on this.

228
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,041
[CONNY] Gotta make
this attack count.

229
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,708
[MARCO] Steady...

230
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,833
[Titan footsteps]

231
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,208
[Cadet terrified]

232
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,958
Almost...

233
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,583
Fire!

234
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,791
Got it!

235
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,958
How're you guys?

236
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,000
Uh-- I, uh--
I'm sorry. I didn't.

237
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,208
[CONNY] Oh crap.

238
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,833
[SASHA] I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

239
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,375
Sasha and Conny missed!

240
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,000
Lead 'em the hell back!

241
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,750
[SASHA] I-- Oh, god.

242
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,166
I said I was sorry!

243
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:28,583
[SASHA] Mikasa!
You saved my life!

244
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,708
Are you okay?

245
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,875
Because of you I am!

246
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,041
Then get up.

247
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,583
I owe you one.

248
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,041
No worries.

249
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,875
[REINER] Wow.

250
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,958
By the skin of your teeth.

251
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,708
You're damn lucky you
didn't end up worse off.

252
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,666
[JEAN] They're all dead!
Start loading up supplies!

253
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,083
It worked!

254
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,708
[CADET 1] We're gonna
make it! We're gonna live!

255
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,708
[CADET 2] No more
of 'em coming in!

256
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,083
[CADET 1] Thank you,
crazy-berserker Titan!

257
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,708
I caved. In front
of the whole gang.

258
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,208
I'm never gonna be able
to face any of 'em again!

259
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,125
Damn it, feel sorry
for yourself later!

260
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,708
Focus on escape!

261
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,083
Listen, man. What you said
about me bein' a leader and all.

262
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,791
Don't talk to me like
that again, alright?

263
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,416
Promise me you're not going
to take this the wrong way.

264
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,250
But I don't think you're a good
leader 'cause you're strong.

265
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,375
I think you're a good leader

266
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,500
'cause you know
what it is to be weak.

267
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,041
[MARCO] You're one of us.

268
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,291
[MARCO] You're scared out of
your mind just like we all are.

269
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,833
[MARCO] It makes
you alert; sympathetic.

270
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,958
You made a damn
good call out there.

271
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,875
Got me runnin' for my life.

272
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,666
You're why I can say this.

273
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,500
[CADET] Ready,
people? Let's do this!

274
00:17:53,583 --> 00:18:00,416
[shouting]

275
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,041
[ARMIN] Mikasa?

276
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,166
What're you doing?
We have to leave now!

277
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,583
Look. Down there.

278
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,291
[ARMIN] Cannibalism?

279
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,625
Can he not regenerate
like the others?

280
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,000
This may sound stupid, but I was
hoping he'd be the key for us.

281
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,333
That he'd help
mankind break the cycle.

282
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,416
Turn the tide just long enough
to give us a little ray of hope.

283
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,166
[REINER] She's right.

284
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,541
He's too valuable to just
let die. There's too much

285
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,083
we can learn from him.
I think it's perfectly clear

286
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,000
our priority should be to
ward the scavengers off him.

287
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,875
He's no good
to us picked apart.

288
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,416
[JEAN] Are you
out of your mind?

289
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,208
We've got a path out of this
nightmare and you wanna stay?

290
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,291
Think about it. Having an
Abnormal as an ally would be

291
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,416
an incredible advantage,
right? A cannon's got nothing

292
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,916
on a Titan who likes
to rip apart his own kind.

293
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,166
You-- Do you hear yourself?
He's not like a new friend!

294
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,625
[ARMIN] Oh, no.

295
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,125
It's the one that ate Thomas!

296
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:21,166
[roaring]

297
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:35,500
[growling]

298
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,375
Holy--

299
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,583
[roar]

300
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,291
[JEAN] What was
that you were saying?

301
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,083
[JEAN] 'Cause I think
it's a moot point now.

302
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,583
Alright, enough of this!

303
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,041
Let's leave while we can!

304
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,708
We're lucky the ugly
bastard didn't get bored.

305
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,000
We'd have been
next on the menu.

306
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,166
Look, a Titan's a Titan--

307
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,291
[gasp]

308
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,708
[ARMIN] Mikasa!

309
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:53,708
[heavy breathing]

310
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,125
[gasp]

311
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:15,291
[heart beats]

312
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:25,333
[Mikasa crying]

313
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:33,166
[Mikasa crying]

314
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,291
[ARMIN] It's him.

315
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:58,791
[ARMIN] But... his arm.
His leg. I don't understand.

316
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:05,041
I watched him get
eaten. I watched him die.

317
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,500
[ARMIN] I saw--

318
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:15,041
[Armin crying]

319
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,375
How is this possible?

320
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:26,125
[Armin crying]

321
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,208
Okay. So, uh...

322
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,625
[JEAN] Eren did all this?

323
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,416
[NARRATOR] The overwhelming
desire for revenge;

324
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,625
[NARRATOR] an emotion
powerful enough to alter

325
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,458
[NARRATOR] even
our physical bodies.

326
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,083
[NARRATOR] When
hate transforms you into

327
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,291
[NARRATOR] the very
thing you despise, however;

328
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,750
[NARRATOR] you might
just find the swords

329
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,416
[NARRATOR] of your
allies turned on you.
