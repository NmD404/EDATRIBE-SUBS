1
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,166
[NARRATOR] Trost
District. Year 850.

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,208
[NARRATOR] Under threat
from his own regiment,

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,291
[NARRATOR] Eren Jaeger invokes
his ability to transform,

4
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,375
[NARRATOR] saving Mikasa
and Armin, but striking fear

5
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,750
[NARRATOR] into the hearts
of his fellow soldiers.

6
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,458
[EREN] I've always
been one of you.

7
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,583
I'm human!

8
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,208
[ARMIN] Eren is not
a foe of humanity!

9
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:47,750
For humanity's glory, in what
little time I have left to live,

10
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,500
I will advocate
his strategic value!

11
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,541
[NARRATOR] That brave
stand went unheeded,

12
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,041
[NARRATOR] but for the
intervention of one man.

13
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,875
[NARRATOR] Dot Pyxis.

14
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,416
[NARRATOR] The
highest ranking officer

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,666
[NARRATOR] in the
Southern Territory.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,291
Calm yourself.

17
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,666
Surely, sir, we can at
least do these young soldiers

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,333
[PYXIS] the favor
of hearing them out.

19
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,375
[EREN] I'll do it! I
don't know if I can, but...

20
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,958
I will. I swear!

21
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,625
Excellently said. You
have the heart of a lion.

22
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,541
[PYXIS] Staff officers, hup!
We have a plan to flesh out!

23
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,333
Wait, we--? We can't
actually be moving forward

24
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,291
with this as our
linchpin strategy.

25
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,250
It was just something
I tossed out there.

26
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,375
[EREN] I was thinking
the same thing.

27
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:24,041
'Cept, he seems like a guy
who knows what he's doing.

28
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,458
Has it all under control,

29
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,083
like we can't see
the forest for the trees,

30
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,750
but he's got a
bird's eye view.

31
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,333
Y'think so?

32
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,250
[EREN] I do. Either way, though,
we've got a whole other problem

33
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,125
[EREN] to address before we can
get your plan off the ground.

34
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,333
[EREN] And my gut tells me that

35
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,666
[EREN] the Commander's
keenly aware of it.

36
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,541
Which would be?

37
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,541
Titans aren't our only foe.

38
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,125
[PYXIS] Look sharp, soldiers.

39
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,958
[PYXIS] The fate of mankind
rests on your shoulders.

40
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,625
[SOLDIER 1] Retake
Trost, are they kidding?

41
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,625
[SOLDIER 2] Someone up
top's lost their marbles;

42
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,375
[SOLDIER 2] how'd they expect
us to shore up the hole?

43
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,291
[SOLDIER 3] Is the
brass that out of touch?

44
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,875
[SOLDIER 3] It's a
damn suicide mission!

45
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,625
[SOLDIER 4]
Lost cause, no doubt.

46
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,375
[SOLDIER 4] Defending Wall Rose
is the only real option here.

47
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,250
[SOLDIER 5] Jackasses.
Some bureaucrat's pushing

48
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,166
[SOLDIER 5] this
through for the glory.

49
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,750
I can't-- I can't go back.

50
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,291
We'll die!
We're all gonna die!

51
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,083
[DAZ] I just want
to see my family!

52
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,375
[MARCO] What the
hell, Daz? Calm down!

53
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,708
Stop shrieking
like a sniveling coward!

54
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,166
[ELITE B] Are you tryin'
to give me the impression

55
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,666
[ELITE B] you're a liability?

56
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,125
Sir, please! Look at us.
We're being marched to

57
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,833
an early grave like
lambs to the slaughter!

58
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,916
[ELITE B] You too good
to sacrifice yourself

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,041
for the good of
humanity, soldier?

60
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,250
Or do you prefer I
cut you down right now

61
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,333
as an example
to your comrades?

62
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,208
[DAZ] Do what you gotta do.
I'll take it over being fed

63
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,416
to a Titan like
human candy any day!

64
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,041
Get a hold of yourself!

65
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,041
[DAZ] Let go of me! Let go!

66
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,291
[DAZ] I'm not going
back to that nightmare!

67
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,625
[MALE SOLDIER 1] You hear that?

68
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,958
[MALE SOLDIER 2] Not gonna
lie, he's got a point.

69
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,583
So, uh... Who do
you think's going to

70
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,458
have a nervous breakdown next?

71
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,125
I dunno. But Trost
isn't the way I want to go.

72
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,083
[ELITE A] Come again?

73
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,666
Uh. I was only
kidding around, sir!

74
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,666
Speak up!

75
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,625
What?

76
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,791
At the top of your lungs.

77
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,916
Make as much
noise as you can, cadet.

78
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,208
[ELITE A] You think everyone
else doesn't feel the same way

79
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,875
[ELITE A] about this
stupid idea as you do?

80
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,666
Now stir up a damn distraction
so I can get out of here!

81
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,458
And where exactly to
you think "out of here" is?

82
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,208
Look man, I just
want to see my daughter!

83
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,583
[ELITE A] We're all
dead anyway, right?

84
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,750
[PYXIS] It's thought by
many that before the Titans

85
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,541
[PYXIS] held sway,
mankind consisted of scores

86
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,833
[PYXIS] of different
races, different creeds;

87
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,291
[PYXIS] all scratching and
biting at each other for blood.

88
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not difficult to
believe that second part.

89
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,458
Some wise man or other
is reputed to have said,

90
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,583
though understand
I'm paraphrasing here,

91
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,166
that humanity
required an enemy

92
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,333
greater than itself
just to survive.

93
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,625
[PYXIS] What do you
suppose he could have meant?

94
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,125
This is the first time
I've ever heard it, sir.

95
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,500
I guess... he thought
we'd all join forces?

96
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,791
[EREN] Some wise man.

97
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,291
[Pyxis laughing]

98
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,833
I like the way your mind works.

99
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,458
You're almost as
twisted and cynical as me.

100
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,750
Well, it's obvious to me
the guy didn't have a clue

101
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,500
what he was talking about.

102
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,166
C'mon. Here we are with an
enemy "greater than ourselves"

103
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,875
bearing down and look at us.

104
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,916
[PYXIS] Exactly. If our species
doesn't pull it together soon,

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,416
[PYXIS] Titans will be merely
the instruments of our demise,

106
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,125
[PYXIS] not the cause.

107
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,583
[HANNES] Eren?

108
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,500
Well I'll be damned.

109
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,833
[HANNES] Wait, what? Is he?

110
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,083
[HANNES] That little punk is
telling me to get back to work.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,583
[HANNES] At least I can assume
Mikasa and Armin are alright,

112
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,833
[HANNES] judging by his
attitude. Still, though.

113
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,125
[HANNES] Why in god's name
is he with the Commander?

114
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,708
[PYXIS] Care for a swig?

115
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,333
Uh... yes, sir.

116
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,333
[DAZ] If you're gonna kill me,

117
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,416
[DAZ] just do it
and get it over with!

118
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,708
[ELITE A] Shut up!
Don't think I won't!

119
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,666
[Pyxis clears throat]

120
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:42,166
Attention!

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,916
Take note. The blueprint of

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,625
the Trost Recovery
Operation is this.

123
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,708
[PYXIS] Our primary objective
is to reseal the hole.

124
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,250
[PYXIS] Yes, you heard right.

125
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,291
[PYXIS] What's more,
it will be done manually.

126
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,833
[MARCO] What?

127
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,708
That's impossible. We
just don't have the tech.

128
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,125
As for how the
task will be done,

129
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,375
that's where this
fellow comes in.

130
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,666
Allow me to introduce
Cadet Eren Jaeger.

131
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,666
Wha-- What the hell?

132
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,791
[PYXIS] Don't let
appearances deceive you.

133
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,291
[PYXIS] This young man is
in fact the successful product

134
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,208
[PYXIS] of cutting-edge science.

135
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,958
[PYXIS] Fantastic
as this may sound,

136
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,958
[PYXIS] Cadet Jaeger
possesses the ability to

137
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,250
[PYXIS] fabricate and
control a Titan body, at will.

138
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,750
Uh. Somebody tell me the
Commander's off his rocker,

139
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,166
'cause otherwise I'm just
too thick to get what he means.

140
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,000
Will you just shut up
and pay attention? Idiot.

141
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,958
[PYXIS] Recall the
massive boulder roughly

142
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,250
[PYXIS] a league from the gate.

143
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,625
[PYXIS] Having assumed
Titan form, Cadet Jaeger

144
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,625
[PYXIS] will hoist said
boulder on his back,

145
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,250
[PYXIS] schlep it to
the hole, and voila!

146
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,958
And this is where
you all come in.

147
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,458
Your job will
be to defend him.

148
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:03,208
Yes. Defend a Titan
against his own kind.

149
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,375
[GUSTAV] What do you
mean we don't actually

150
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,583
[GUSTAV] need to fight them?

151
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,916
There's an easier way.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,833
Sorry, I know it's
not my place to interrupt.

153
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,166
I mean no disrespect.

154
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,333
It's alright. Just go on
with what you were saying.

155
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,125
Right. Thank you, sir.

156
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,125
See, whatever else
is going on around them,

157
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,750
Titans are generally drawn
to large groups of people.

158
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,125
[ARMIN] If enough
of us collected in

159
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,541
[ARMIN] the corner
away from the breach,

160
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,500
[ARMIN] we could lure the
Titans out of Eren's path.

161
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,666
[ARMIN] He could be discrete
about moving the boulder.

162
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,125
[ARMIN] He also won't
have to slow his pace

163
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,916
[ARMIN] while we fight
the others off of him.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,041
[ARMIN] And since the Titans
will all be in one area,

165
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,833
[ARMIN] we can pick
them off via cannon fire

166
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,666
[ARMIN] without incurring
causalities of our own.

167
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,333
[ARMIN] Now I'm not suggesting
we leave Eren defenseless.

168
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,750
[ARMIN] That'd be too risky.
We'll need a modest band

169
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,083
[ARMIN] of Elites to
act as his bodyguards.

170
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,791
There's no way of
knowing how many Titans

171
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,791
might come through the hole

172
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,208
while he's trying
to patch it up.

173
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,625
[ARMIN] His security
detail will need to

174
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,375
[ARMIN] be able to handle them.

175
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,875
Easy enough, I think. We can
retool the plan around that.

176
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,458
The thing is, we're making
a huge assumption here.

177
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,583
Namely that Eren even
in full-on Titan mode

178
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,625
is strong enough
to move the rock.

179
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,333
[ARMIN] I mean,
to be perfectly honest,

180
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,125
[ARMIN] there's very little
reason for us to suppose he can.

181
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,583
[ARMIN] I have my
doubts. Serious ones.

182
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,833
As do I. Sending people
to their doom on a whim

183
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,791
isn't a tactic I'm fond of.

184
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,291
Uncertainty's killed
too many already.

185
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,041
But the Commander's
right. We must do this.

186
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,541
Agreed. We're working
against the clock here.

187
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,583
[ANKA] Titans are
still lumbering into Trost

188
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,083
[ANKA] as we speak.

189
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,750
There already may be more
than we can handle, frankly.

190
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,958
The longer we wait, the worse
our chances of success become.

191
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,000
And it goes without saying,
the better our chances

192
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,250
they'll bust through Wall
Rose and wreak untold havoc.

193
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,166
There's something else, too.

194
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,583
Even the bravest of us can't
indefinitely bottle our fear.

195
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,791
Not before something gives.

196
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,416
[ELITE B] The kid can
lift a rock that big?

197
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,375
Is this real? Is he saying
we finally have an advantage?

198
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,875
They're lying! I'm
not gonna be drawn into

199
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,083
sacrificing myself
for this crap!

200
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,583
We're just disposable
tools to you people!

201
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,208
You expect us
to live and die by

202
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,916
whatever the hell
comes out of your mouth!

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,500
[ELITE C] You mean
he's a human weapon?

204
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,000
[ELITE D] C'mon. They're
obviously full of it.

205
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,541
[ELITE E] We're being played.

206
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,500
This is not how I'm goin' out.
Good luck to the rest of ya.

207
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,291
[MALE SOLDIER 1]
I'm out of here!

208
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,541
[MALE SOLDIER 2] Me too!

209
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,041
[MALE SOLDIER 3] Yeah,
screw a bunch of this!

210
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,333
[ELITE B] So help me god,
I'll execute you on the spot!

211
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,416
To hell with you!

212
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,250
My family gets
the time I have left!

213
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,958
This is getting out of hand.

214
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,333
I know. If we don't act now,
the whole thing'll break down.

215
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,875
Traitors! I'll kill
you where you stand!

216
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,958
Desertion is answered by death!

217
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,791
[soldiers panicking]

218
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,083
Anyone wishing to leave
will by my personal order

219
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,375
[PYXIS] not be
charged with treason!

220
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,625
Those who have seen
a Titan first hand

221
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,208
will not be expected to
revisit such horror again.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,333
[PYXIS] Whomever
this applies to,

223
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,041
[PYXIS] you may leave
with my blessing.

224
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,583
[PYXIS] Additionally, anyone
with family or loved ones

225
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,583
[PYXIS] they would spare from
the same trauma may also leave.

226
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,791
[PYXIS] The crown will continue
to recognize your service.

227
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,041
[PYXIS] Thank you
and good luck!

228
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,000
[GIRL] Daddy!

229
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,500
I couldn't live with myself.

230
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,875
My daughter's my all.

231
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,500
[ELITE A] Daddy's coming,
sweetheart. Don't you worry.

232
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,291
Now, think back four years ago.

233
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,666
[PYXIS] Namely, the operation
to retake Wall Maria.

234
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,541
[PYXIS] I bring it up
because you all deserve

235
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,333
[PYXIS] to have your
suspicions confirmed.

236
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,750
[PYXIS] Officially, we
labeled it reconnaissance.

237
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,000
[PYXIS] But in fact, as
most of you probably know,

238
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,000
[PYXIS] it was little
more than a purge;

239
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:53,000
[PYXIS] a thinly disguised
exercise in population control.

240
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,500
[PYXIS] We knew this in
our hearts, of course we did.

241
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,250
[PYXIS] Yet we
turned a blind eye.

242
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,291
[PYXIS] We supported
the state-sponsored myth

243
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,291
[PYXIS] because the deaths
of our fellow human beings

244
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,666
[PYXIS] allowed us to
survive. Pure and simple.

245
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,041
The guilt is ours. We
share the blame. All of us.

246
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,875
[PYXIS] The citizens of Wall
Maria sustained themselves on

247
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,083
[PYXIS] the wholesale
slaughter of the refugees

248
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,791
[PYXIS] who'd
flown to us for help.

249
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,541
[PYXIS] But turnabout
is fair play, is it not?

250
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,541
[PYXIS] If Wall Maria succumbs,
the population will fall

251
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,458
[PYXIS] by a whole
other order of magnitude!

252
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,750
[PYXIS] The lands comprising
Wall Sina wouldn't support

253
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,666
[PYXIS] half the
people now living.

254
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,750
[PYXIS] If we're wiped
off the face of the earth,

255
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,750
[PYXIS] the culprits will
not have been the Titans,

256
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,375
[PYXIS] let me assure you.

257
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,583
[PYXIS] No, no. We'll
have done it to ourselves.

258
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,000
[PYXIS] If the line isn't drawn
now, it won't be drawn at all.

259
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,333
If we must die...

260
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,166
[PYXIS] let us die here!

261
00:13:53,250 --> 00:14:00,500
♪

262
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,375
[EREN] I don't know if I'll
actually be strong enough

263
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,583
[EREN] in Titan form to lift
that rock in the first place.

264
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:09,458
[EREN] But, I'm sure
as hell going to try.

265
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,916
[EREN] Maybe this is naïve.

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,625
[EREN] Maybe we're
running on false hope,

267
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,375
[EREN] but so what?
I have to power through.

268
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,666
[EREN] For them. For all of us.

269
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:25,208
[EREN] My role-- No. My duty,
is to make false hope real.

270
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,750
[PYXIS] Good, you're all here.

271
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,208
[PYXIS] You have one
mission and one mission only.

272
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,375
[PYXIS] Protect Eren Jaeger.

273
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,541
[PYXIS] Any risks associated
with this operation

274
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,208
[PYXIS] are yours to eliminate.

275
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,833
[PYXIS] Which, I'm
sure you'll surmise,

276
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,125
[PYXIS] means out of everyone,
your jobs are the worst.

277
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,666
Our success or failure
will depend on you.

278
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,916
In fact, it's safe to say

279
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,791
the fate of mankind
will reflect your own.

280
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,333
[RICO] Sir.
May I ask something?

281
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,875
Of course.

282
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,625
Are you certain about this?

283
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,458
Pinning our hopes
on Jaeger, I mean.

284
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,666
Rico, don't.

285
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,458
I'm sorry. I assume
we all have our doubts.

286
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,541
Sir, please.
With all due respect,

287
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,333
the kid's abilities
are an unknown quantity;

288
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,208
we don't have the first
idea what he will or won't do.

289
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,458
[MITABI] If he
can't lift the rock,

290
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,958
[MITABI] or worse,
he goes rogue,

291
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,000
[MITABI] a lot of lives will
have been lost for nothing.

292
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,625
You make a good point.
Perhaps we ought to just

293
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,125
give ourselves up
to the Titans willingly.

294
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,916
[PYXIS] Personally,
the idea makes me sick.

295
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,916
[PYXIS] I'm a sore loser.

296
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,958
You'd think I'd be used to it.

297
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,208
I've been stuck on the
losing side since day one.

298
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,875
[PYXIS] I'm a stubborn
old fool, though.

299
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,625
[PYXIS] Just once I'd like to
know what victory feels like.

300
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,125
[PYXIS] Even if I have to
resort to extreme measures.

301
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,166
Naturally, sir!

302
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,875
I'm sure we all
feel the same way!

303
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,666
Then I suppose we'll
just have to wait and see.

304
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,041
The boy's abilities may
be an "unknown quantity,"

305
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll give you that...

306
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,666
But I'll take it over the
known quantity of our options.

307
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,708
[GUSTAV] Sir. It's time to get
the decoy operation on its feet.

308
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,708
Ian Dietrich.

309
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,708
[PYXIS] Rico Brzenska.

310
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,625
[PYXIS] Mitabi Jarnach.

311
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,583
[PYXIS] You are the Garrison
Regiment's best and brightest.

312
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,291
Win this one for humanity.

313
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,666
[ALL] Sir!

314
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,500
Excellent. Ian, I'm
assigning you squad leader.

315
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,416
On-site contingencies
will be yours to deal with.

316
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,750
Uh. But, sir. That is--

317
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,125
I have no objections.

318
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,541
Neither do I.

319
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,916
Please, sir. I'm
not competent enough.

320
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,583
[PYXIS] Now, now.

321
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,333
You appreciate
alcohol, do you not?

322
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,541
Sir?

323
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,333
You know a good vintage.

324
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,833
You know a
shoddy one, as well.

325
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,833
So, there it is.

326
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,750
Sir!

327
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,791
[ARMIN] I'm so sorry, Eren.

328
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,041
[ARMIN] I was just
talking out of my head.

329
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,375
[ARMIN] It wasn't
my intention for you to

330
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,750
[ARMIN] be pulled
into all this.

331
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,500
Stop apologizing. The
fact is you have a gift

332
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,500
for strategy
