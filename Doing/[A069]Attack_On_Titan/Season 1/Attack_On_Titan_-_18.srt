1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:24,208
[ERWIN] It's officially begun.
The 57th Recon Mission!

2
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,166
[ERWIN] Scouts, move out!

3
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,416
[ERWIN] Intel suggests
that the cellar of

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,916
[ERWIN] Jaeger's
home in Shiganshina

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,958
[ERWIN] holds a vital
secret regarding our enemy.

6
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,791
[ERWIN] That's our destination.

7
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,833
[NESS] You rookies
will be here. Between the

8
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:47,416
[NESS] wagon defense squad
and the Scout support squad.

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,125
[NESS] You will
run spare horses,

10
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,833
[NESS] as well
as relay signals.

11
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,625
Beyond that will be
uninterrupted Titan territory.

12
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,583
We'll be more
or less on our own.

13
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,166
[GUNTHER] The only thing
to fall back on out there is

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,083
[GUNTHER] Commander Erwin's
long-range scouting formation.

15
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,541
[GUNTHER] The special ops
squad will be positioned here.

16
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,750
[ARMIN] We're not
dealing with an Abnormal.

17
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,500
[ARMIN] This thing's
showing intelligence!

18
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,250
[ARMIN] Like the Colossal.

19
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,833
[ARMIN] Like Eren!

20
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,791
[ARMIN] It's a human being
wrapped in a Titan body!

21
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,208
[JEAN] The moves on this one,
she's like a damn athlete!

22
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,208
[JEAN] We are so screwed!

23
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,583
[JEAN] What? She's
protecting her weak spot?

24
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,791
[JEAN] Damn it!
There's nothing I can do.

25
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,833
Jean! Don't let that
suicidal maniac die in vain!

26
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,458
[JEAN] Why did she stop?

27
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,833
[ARMIN] She did it!
She's the one who killed him!

28
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,541
[ARMIN] I told him the
right wing was suicide

29
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,916
[ARMIN] but he
went along anyway!

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,666
[ARMIN] And how he's
dead, thanks to her!

31
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,708
Oh no.

32
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,666
Odds are that bought the
platoon more than enough time.

33
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,083
I say we follow suit,
and get outta here!

34
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:18,250
[ARMIN] What? Wait. No.

35
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:22,291
[ARMIN] She's--
She's going for Eren!

36
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:05,541
[whistle call]

37
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,958
[REINER] Where'd they get
this? How old's your gear?

38
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,541
[ARMIN] Don't worry about it.

39
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,625
[ARMIN] It came off like it's
supposed to, so it didn't break.

40
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,541
[ARMIN] Should still
be in decent shape.

41
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,333
All right. That's
something, then.

42
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,041
Still down a horse, though.

43
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,208
Not an ideal situation.

44
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,666
[whistle call]

45
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,583
We can't get movin' again
until Jean's ride shows up.

46
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,750
[JEAN] Just my luck.

47
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,375
[JEAN] Reiner's horse comes
back like an old lover.

48
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,583
[JEAN] Why the hell's
mine gotta go AWOL?

49
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,666
[whistle call]

50
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,541
[JEAN] Damn it.
We can't afford to

51
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,583
[JEAN] stay out in
the open like this.

52
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,250
[JEAN] If worse comes to worse,

53
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,916
[JEAN] one of us'll
have to get left behind.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,250
[JEAN] What are we supposed
to do? Draw straws?

55
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:56,291
[JEAN] Armin's hurt. Reiner's
too big to ride with safely.

56
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,833
[JEAN] Maybe I should
just take my chances

57
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,208
[JEAN] horse-retrieving on foot.

58
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,500
Dammit!

59
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,000
[JEAN] How messed up
is it that we might even

60
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,666
[JEAN] have to
even consider that?

61
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,625
[JEAN] Out of the
frying pan, into the fire.

62
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,291
[JEAN] It's what we get for
narrowly escaping death.

63
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:18,333
[whistle call]

64
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,583
[shaky breath]

65
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,333
[REINER] Armin.

66
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,916
[REINER] You with me?

67
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,125
I guess your head's still
a little shaken up, huh?

68
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,583
Um. I might still be
a little foggy, yeah.

69
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,791
It's okay. The
choice isn't gonna be

70
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,250
any easier with
you thinkin' clearly.

71
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,250
[REINER] One of us is
gonna have to stay here.

72
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,125
[REINER] We need
to figure out who.

73
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,791
Wait a sec! I mean
shouldn't we at least

74
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,708
fire off a smoke signal first?

75
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,416
If everyone kept
going straight, Row Four,

76
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,666
Squad Three ought to be in
close proximity to us by now.

77
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,541
Well, that's the emergency
signal, but who knows?

78
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,125
I doubt anyone's
gonna see it and think,

79
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,250
"Hey, somebody must
need an extra horse."

80
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,250
Armin. Listen. We
only wait three minutes.

81
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,916
If no one shows, we
have to decide who stays.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,916
[ARMIN] It should be me.

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,750
But, if I'm going to be
left out here in the open,

84
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,916
I need you to relay a message.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,250
If possible, give it
only to Commander Erwin.

86
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,708
[JEAN] Hang on, Armin!

87
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,916
[JEAN] Looks like you'll be
able to tell him yourself.

88
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,541
Someone answered
the call! Hell yes!

89
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,208
They've got two horses in tow!

90
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,041
Huh?

91
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,000
[JEAN] Whoa, that's--

92
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,625
[JEAN] It's Christa!

93
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,208
Hey guys, you alright?

94
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,958
[JEAN] Well, damn! That's
my li'l runaway! [chuckling]

95
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,166
[JEAN] Easy, Buchwald.
It's okay. I forgive you.

96
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,791
[CHRISTA] Poor thing.
He ran to me like

97
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,791
[CHRISTA] the devil
was on his tail.

98
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,416
[CHRISTA] So did
you guys fight a Titan?

99
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,458
Oh, no! Armin, your
head! You've been hurt!

100
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,333
[ARMIN] It's nothing. Promise.

101
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,250
[REINER] I'm impressed
someone actually answered

102
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,750
[REINER] our distress signal.

103
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,500
Well I wasn't far away, so.
That and I found the horse.

104
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,708
A lot of people wouldn't have
risked the trek over here.

105
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,958
You're as noble as
the steeds you tame.

106
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,875
We're all in your debt.

107
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,875
It was nothing.

108
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:30,625
I'm just-- I'm just
glad that you're all okay.

109
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,958
What would we do without you?

110
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,708
[ARMIN] She's an angel.

111
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,083
[JEAN] A goddess.

112
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,041
[REINER] One day, my wife.

113
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,916
[CHRISTA] Okay. I suppose we'd
better rejoin the formation.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,875
[JEAN] Yeah! They'll order
a retreat any minute now!

115
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,666
[JEAN] I'll just say it.
I'm glad we survived,

116
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,458
[JEAN] but heading
back after only an hour?

117
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,083
[JEAN] Not really something
to be proud of, if you ask me.

118
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,583
[JEAN] And while we're on the
subject, is anybody else curious

119
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,916
[JEAN] why she's headed
away from the command squad?

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,375
[CHRISTA] She?

121
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,041
[JEAN] Green smoke?

122
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,125
[ARMIN] Looks like we're
not heading back after all,

123
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,333
[ARMIN] just changing course.

124
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,333
Yeah, but that
doesn't make sense!

125
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,958
What the hell? Is Commander
Erwin out of his mind?

126
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,541
Every one of us
has the authority

127
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,458
to declare the mission failed.

128
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,083
Why isn't anyone speaking up?

129
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,333
Is the command squad too
far ahead to see their signals?

130
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:33,041
Possibly. But either way,
I think our course is clear.

131
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,166
Assume command's got this.

132
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,125
[LEVI] Smoke signals. Green.

133
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,083
[LEVI] Oruo, pass it on.

134
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,166
With pleasure, sir!

135
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,875
[EREN] Things seem to be going
pretty smoothly for the moment.

136
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,291
[EREN] Still. I wonder
how it really is.

137
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,166
[EREN] My gut tells
me the frontline's

138
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,041
[EREN] already
taken a serious hit.

139
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,791
[MAN] Reporting, sir!

140
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,708
[MAN] An oral message! It
appears the right-wing spotters

141
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,125
have been wiped out!

142
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,500
[MAN] The early warning
network is compromised.

143
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,541
[MAN] One of you will need to
relay the message down the line.

144
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,250
You heard the
man, Petra. Go on.

145
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,916
Sir!

146
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,458
[EREN] The right wing? That's
where Armin's positioned!

147
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,333
[EREN] Still. He wasn't
with the outliers.

148
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,666
[EREN] He and the others
were more toward the center.

149
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,750
[EREN] Surely the Titans
haven't made it that far in?

150
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,083
[EREN] Black smoke?

151
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,500
An Abnormal!

152
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,958
Eren. Fire the signal.

153
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,583
Yes, sir.

154
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,625
This is a disgrace.
Lotta good the formation does

155
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,250
if the bastards can
bore into it that deeply.

156
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,500
[EREN] So close. Too close.

157
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,375
[EREN] Just under
that smoke, someone--

158
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,708
[EREN] someone's fighting.

159
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,125
[DARIUS] Damn it.

160
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,666
I'm right in front of you!
Look down, you monster!

161
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,833
Now!

162
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,375
[DARIUS] We've got you now!
You're clever, but I'd like to

163
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,916
[DARIUS] see you defend
all three weak spots at once!

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,583
Cut the Achilles'
Heel! The spinal cord!

165
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,833
Whatever brings the
bitch to her knees! Attack!

166
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,083
For the soldiers you've killed!

167
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,375
We're gonna
make sure this hurts!

168
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,291
She jumped?

169
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,500
[SOLDIER] Put me

[SOLDIER 2] Your guess
is as good as mine.

188
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,125
[SOLDIER 2] We should
be heading south, not east.

is to enter this forest.

[BOTH SOLDIERS] Yes, sir!

198
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,083
Excuse me, sir. It looks
as though the center rank

199

is heading straight
into the forest.

Won't we run smack dab into

Bizarre. But so be it.

208
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,958
Commander Erwin must
have something in mind.

209
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,791
Perhaps the situation
compels him to improvise.

210
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,208
That gives me a
lot of confidence.

211
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,916
Maybe he's looking
for a nice, shady spot

[JEAN] We'd be sittin' ducks.
He's got to know that.

218
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,875
Yeah, we're just passing through
on the way to somewhere else;

219
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,666
no one in his right mind
would make us stop here.

Okay. What the
hell's going on?

230
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:18,291
So. Hey. Only the center rank
is going into the forest then?

231
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,125
[CONNY] What about
the formation?

232
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,166
Apparently it's breaking up.

233
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,416
[MIKASA] The path isn't wide
enough for the side ranks.

234
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,041
[MIKASA] We have to go around.
It's the only tactical option.

235
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,166
Even if it means
we're useless as spotters.

236
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,416
But couldn't we have just
avoided the forest altogether?

237
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,833
The commander misread a map and
realize it too late, or what?

238
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,000
No clue. Maybe we're
here to shake the threat

239
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,458
that's been on our right.

240
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:46,541
The trees make a decent
cover, I suppose. Maybe.

241
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,791
[JEAN] Do you believe this B.S.?

242
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,708
[JEAN] Am I the only one who
wonders what happened with

243
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,375
[JEAN] the whole "logistics
base," thing? Or why we didn't

244
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,708
[JEAN] go galloping home after
the Female Titan showed up?

245
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,541
[JEAN] Why're we suddenly
all playing birdhouse?

246
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,416
[JEAN] Oh wait, no.
I know the last one.

247
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,125
[JEAN] No, Titans allowed in the
center rank's nature retreat.

248
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:22,250
Fool. He's got no
idea what's going on.

249
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,666
He'll hear you.

250
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,750
What do I care? He's
not explaining anything

251
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,458
to the ones risking
their lives. Look at him.

252
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,875
He acts all
calm and in control,

253
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,791
but you can
see he's petrified.

254
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,333
What do you mean?

255
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,375
They say when officers in the
field are deemed incompetent

256
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,708
by their men they
can be relieved of duty.

257
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,791
Or in more extreme
cases, they can die from

258
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,541
mysterious stab wounds to
the back. I suppose there's

259
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,541
all kinds of accidents
that could happen out here.

260
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,083

thinking of doing...

261
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,958
Look, I'm just talkin'.

262
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,875
and I need to vent, alright?

263

I'm not gonna start a mutiny.
Well, not yet anyway.

264
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,416
[JEAN] Just answer me this.

265
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,083
You agree with this strategy or
is it a bunch of crap? Really.

266
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,416
[JEAN] 'Cause you look like
you know something I don't.

267
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,458
Well, um.

268
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,041
[SQUAD CAPTAIN] 5-meter
Titan approaching!

269
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,625
[ARMIN] Why did the commander
opt to bring us here?

270
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:29,583
[ARMIN] I can't make sense
of it. What was he thinking?

271
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,500
[ARMIN] No. That's wrong.

272
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,333
[ARMIN] That's not the
question I should be asking.

273
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,875
[ARMIN] The real puzzle is this:

274
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,416
[ARMIN] if the Female Titan
is in fact pursuing Eren,

275
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,000
[ARMIN] does Erwin know?
Is that why we're here?

276
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,041
[EREN] Captain! Captain Levi!

277
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,458
[LEVI] What?

278
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,541
C'mon, sir! We're in a forest!

279
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,458
We won't see a Titan 'til
it's right on top of us!

280
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,041

totally cut off!

281
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,375
Something's coming up
on the right, isn't it?

282
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,208
[EREN] So what are
we supposed to do?

283
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,750
[EREN] Avoid Titans
or defend the wagons?

284
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,916
Quit whining and move
on from the obvious already.

285
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Neither of those
is an option anymore.

286
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,125
Wha--? What are
you talking about?

287
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,333
Haven't you noticed
what's arond you?

288
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,000
Take a look at
these big ass trees.

289
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,666
[LEVI] Perfect environment for
ODM gear, wouldn't you say?

290
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,916
[LEVI] Take my advice, Eren.
Calm down and use your head.

291
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,625
[LEVI] The best survival
tool is your brain.

292
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,750
[EREN] Yes, sir!

293
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,541
[EREN] He's right. I'm new to
this, so virtually everything

294
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,916
[EREN] about it's gonna
throw me for a loop.

295
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,416
[EREN] Simple answers
are for children.

296
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,083
[EREN] Only way
to learn is by doing.

297
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,208
[EREN] If I want to
cut it with these guys,

298
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,750
[EREN] I've gotta stop
cryin' to be spoon-fed.

299
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,916
Doesn't make sense.
What are we doing here?

300
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,541
There's gotta be a reason.

301
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,916
[ORUO] I mean they know,
right? They gotta!

302
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,458
[EREN] Huh?

303
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,416
[EREN] Wait. Are we
all in the dark here?

304
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,583
[EREN] What the hell's
going on? Really?

305
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:13,708
[EREN] Does that mean,
even Captain Levi's clueless?

306
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,750
[ARMIN] Break it down
to its simplest elements.

307
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,708
[ARMIN] If the Titan
really is after Eren, then...

308
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,333
[ARMIN] there's only one
reason for our being here.

309
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:27,208

and he intends to confront her!

out, right? Right?
