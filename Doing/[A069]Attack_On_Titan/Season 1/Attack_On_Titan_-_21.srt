1
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,750
[ERWIN] It's officially begun.
The 57th Recon Mission!

2
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,416
[ERWIN] Scouts, move out!

3
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,583
[NARRATOR] After
setting forth to establish

4
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,125
[NARRATOR]
a route to Shiganshina,

5
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,375
[NARRATOR] the Scout Regiment
encountered a Female Titan

6
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,958
[NARRATOR] seemingly
possessed of sharp,

7
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,041
[NARRATOR]
cold-hearted intelligence.

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,666
[ARMIN] We're not
dealing with an Abnormal,

9
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,583
[ARMIN] this thing's
showing intelligence!

10
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,333
[ARMIN] It's a human being
wrapped in a Titan body!

11
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,541
[NARRATOR] As soldier upon
soldier fell to this new foe,

12
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,833
[NARRATOR] the
regiment retreated into

13
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,791
[NARRATOR] a forest
of massive trees.

14
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,916
[NARRATOR] Though
to what purpose,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
[NARRATOR] no one
appeared to know.

16
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,708
[EREN] If the Levi Squad can't
stop this thing, then who can?

17
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,250
[EREN] Those men need us!

18
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,625
[LEVI] The choice is yours.

19
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,708
[LEVI] You can trust yourself,

20
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,083
[LEVI] or you can trust
the people willing to

21
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,583
[LEVI] put their
lives on the line for you.

22
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,291
I'm with you!

23
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,958
Fire!

24
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,500
[LEVI] Oh, that's right.

25
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,791
[LEVI] While we're on
that subject, let me ask.

26
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,833
You're okay with me cuttin' your
limbs off at the joints, right?

27
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,875
[LEVI] I'm mean,
they'll grow back?

28
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:49,458
[LEVI] I'm talking
about your actual body.

29
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,125
[LEVI] Don't want
you dead just yet.

30
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,958
[LEVI] Timing wouldn't work.

31
00:01:54,041 --> 00:02:01,583
[Female Titan roaring]

32
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,208
[ERWIN] Think about it.
The enemy was prepared

33
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,125
[ERWIN] to make
sacrifices. Enormous ones.

34
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,208
[ERWIN] So committed to
maintaining her secret,

35
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,583
[ERWIN] she would
rather let herself be

36
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,000
[ERWIN] cannibalized
than exposed.

37
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,708
[ERWIN] All hands, withdraw!

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,041
[ERWIN] Redeploy the formation!

39
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,166
[ERWIN] Return to
Calaneth District!

40
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,916
[HANGE] Erwin. Why bother
having him replenish?

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,416
[HANGE] There's no time.

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,708
[ERWIN] We saw the
Female Titan get eaten.

43
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,375
[ERWIN] Did we actually
see the person inside

44
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,958
[ERWIN] suffer the
same fate? I didn't.

45
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,791
[gasp] You mean?

46
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,250
[ERWIN] Yes. Your hypothesis
is correct. This isn't over.

47
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,250
We're dealing
with someone like Eren.

48
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,583
[ERWIN] Someone who regenerates
in and out of Titan form.

49
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,458
[ERWIN] Suppose that
person equipped themselves

50
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,500
[ERWIN] with
ODM gear in advance.

51
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,666
[ERWIN] Suppose further
that they're also disguised

52
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,208
[ERWIN] in one
of our uniforms?

53
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,958
[ERWIN] What would
their next move be?

54
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,000
[GUNTHER] Captain Levi?

55
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,958
Wait, that--
That's not-- Oh shit!

56
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,375
[EREN] Gunther!

57
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,125
[gasp]

58
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,875
[ERWIN] How do you
ferret out the enemy...

59
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,750
[ERWIN] when they're
one of your own?

60
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,375
[ERWIN] When the Colossal
Titan breached the wall

61
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,000
[ERWIN] and disappeared,
theoretically,

62
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,083
whoever was inside
had with ODM gear.

63
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,500
They would have used it in
escape before the steam cleared.

64
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,916
It's possible the
same thing happened here.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,458
I don't see how, sir.

66
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,291
Based on Eren's condition when
he emerged from Titan form,

67
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,166
I think it's safe to assume
that something like that

68
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,958
is highly unlikely.

69
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,250
[HANGE] His equipment
was broken.

70
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,458
[HANGE] Parts of his
uniform were missing.

71
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,166
[HANGE] More importantly, Eren
was so spent he couldn't even

72
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,166
[HANGE] stand on his own
two feet without assistance.

73
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,166
The Female Titan's ability
to summon reinforcements

74
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,833
was unlike anything
we've encountered before.

75
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:48,750
Our failure to anticipate that
factor cost us the operation.

76
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,666
[ERWIN] Evidently, there are
different levels of mastery

77
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,333
[ERWIN] to the Titan ability.

78
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,000
[ERWIN] We were naive to
think that a mere novice

79
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,208
[ERWIN] like Eren
would set the standard.

80
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,625
If we're to stop
this enemy, it's clear now

81
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,125
that we'll need to
broaden our way of thinking.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,250
[JEAN] So if we're
goin' home, that means

83
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,541
the operation's
a success, right?

84
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,041
Hopefully so.

85
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,166
If that is the case, then that
might mean they've already

86
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,125
discovered the
Female Titan's identity.

87
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,416
[JEAN] I wouldn't mind
knowin' that myself.

88
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,958
[JEAN] Still, I'm
impressed with the commander.

89
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,458
[JEAN] How'd he know
she'd come after us

90
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,500
[JEAN] once we took
Eren beyond the Wall?

91
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,291
[ARMIN] Think about it.
During the Trost invasion,

92
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,375
[ARMIN] did it strike you
as odd the way the Titans

93
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,583
[ARMIN] suddenly halted
their advance midway through?

94
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,666
[JEAN] Huh?

95
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,958
They must have
intended some purpose

96
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,791
when they destroyed
the front gate,

97
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,458
[ARMIN] but they never made
a move on the inner gate.

98
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,083
[ARMIN] Nor did they
interfere with Eren

99
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,916
[ARMIN] when he
sealed the breach.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,541
[ARMIN] Perhaps, something
happened which made them

101
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,208
[ARMIN] re-evaluate
their plan entirely.

102
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,625
And what would that be?

103
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,958
Something drew their focus away
from the Wall's destruction.

104
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,750
Something that forced
them to call off the attack.

105
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,750
You mean Eren's
transformation?

106
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,666
[ARMIN] That's the
most logical conclusion.

107
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,791
Wait, but then
that would mean--

108
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,041
It means they were there.

109
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,583
[ARMIN] Whoever called off
the attack saw Eren transform.

110
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,916
[ARMIN] It means the
enemy is one of us!

111
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,250
Gunther!

112
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,125
[ORUO] Go kid! C'mon!

113
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,875
Keep moving!

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,625
[EREN] We-- We're
just leaving him?

115
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,458
Who is that?

116
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,958
[ELD] Keep 'em away from Eren!

117
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,333
Damn it! Hey, Eld.
What're we doin', huh?

118
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,875
There isn't time
to get the horses.

119
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,333
Make for HQ at full speed!

120
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,416
Is that the Female Titan?
Or did she have an accomplice?

121
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,833
Damn! Whoever it is,
they're gonna pay!

122
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,166
Even if it's
the last thing I do!

123
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,083
[EREN] The Female Titan?
No. That can't be right!

124
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,875
[EREN] I thought we caught her!

125
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,958
[ERWIN] We have to consider
that if the enemy was

126
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,708
still able-bodied
when they escaped,

127
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,250
then it's entirely
possible they can

128
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,666
make the Titan
reappear as well.

129
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,458
[ORUO] I hate being right!

130
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,500
No time to lose! Move it!

131
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,333
[ELD] She's coming for us!

132
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,375
[EREN] Damn you! Not again!

133
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,625
I'll kill you! I swear I will!

134
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,125
No! Don't!

135
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,541
We've got this! The
three of us can handle her!

136
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,875
You get back
to base! Go! Now!

137
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,166
[ERWIN] This enemy
forces us to rethink

138
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,208
[ERWIN] everything
we've learned.

139
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,750
What seems the
most logical strategy

140
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,416
might prove to be the
worst course of action.

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,583
Mark my words.
The time will come

142
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,750
when risking everything is
the only choice left to us.

143
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,083
[EREN] I can fight her, too!

144
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,916
[ELD] Just go! This is
our best course of action!

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,375
We can not afford
to put you at risk!

146
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,708
Have you learned nothing?

147
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,000
After all this, you
still doubt our skills?

148
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,875
Is that true, Eren?

149
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,500
I thought you had faith
in us. That you trusted us!

150
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:22,833
And unless we can take that
risk, humanity can never win.

151
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:32,083
[EREN] I have faith
in the Levi Squad!

152
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,083
[EREN] Good luck!

153
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,750
[warcry]

154
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,291
[gasp]

155
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,666
[ELD] We've blinded her!
That should give us at least

156
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,458
[ELD] a minute before
she can regenerate!

157
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,208
[PETRA] We'll finish
her well before then!

158
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,500
[ORUO] To hell
with capturing you!

159
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,541
[ELD] We're gonna kill you!

160
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,541
[PETRA] We're
gonna carve you up!

161
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,875
[ORUO] We'll make
you pay, bitch!

162
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,041
[ELD] Covering your
neck isn't gonna save you!

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,458
[ELD] We'll just keep
slicing those shoulders

164
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,958
[ELD] 'til your
arms are worthless.

165
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,291
T[ELD] rust me, we know
what we're doing. No mercy!

166
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,083
[PETRA] We'll
cut you to ribbons!

167
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,333
[ORUO] Lop off your arms!

168
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,875
[ELD] Send you to hell!

169
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,375
[ORUO] They're down!
