00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,916
[NARRATOR] two terrifying
new breeds of Titan appeared:

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
[NARRATOR] the Colossal
and the Armored,

00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,750

through the outer walls as if

Titan onslaught advanced,

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,416

to withdrawal behind Wall Rose.

13
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:54,083

to stop the Titan onslaught.

00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,416
[ARMIN] Eren will most
likely spring into action

175
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,583
[ARMIN] and be long
gone before that happens.

176
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,875
[ARMIN] Why am I thinking
of that at a time like this?

177
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,875
[ARMIN] Is it-- Is it because
this is the end for us?

178
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:14,791
[ARMIN] When it's all said and
done, at the moment of truth,

179
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:19,333
[ARMIN] I was a coward.
Same as right now.

180
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,958
[ARMIN] I can't count
the number of times

181
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,000
[ARMIN] they've
come to my rescue.

182
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,166
[ARMIN] I was always so weak.

183
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,416
[ARMIN] I could never
reciprocate the favor.

184
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,416
[ARMIN] I still
haven't earned the right

185
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,083
[ARMIN] to think of
myself as their equal.

186
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,750
[ARMIN] I-I can't afford to
try and repay their kindness

187
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,500
[ARMIN] by going with them.

188
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,541
[ARMIN] I'd only end
up slowing them down.

189
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:58,250
[ARMIN] I'm afraid this
might be the last time

190
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,750
[ARMIN] the three of us
will ever be together.

191
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,458
Listen, I won't--

192
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,166
Just wait a second, would ya?

193
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,916
If you recall, I
said I had two ideas.

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,166
Armin, I trust you to
make the right decision.

195
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,750
Eh? Huh?

196
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,166
Now hear me out.

197
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,625
And yes, I'm aware of how
unrealistic this plan is.

198
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,250
The best-case scenario?

199
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,083
[EREN] I try to use my
Titan ability strategically.

200
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,375
Under Military direction.

201
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,833
This might sound crazy...

202
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,541
[EREN] but if you
think you can convince

203
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,416
[EREN] the Garrison Regiment,
right here and now,

204
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,666
[EREN] that I present
no threat to them,

205
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,041
I'll trust you and
we'll go with that option.

206
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,791
That's my second idea.

207
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,666
[EREN] If you don't
think you can get it done,

208
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,583
then my last resort
is the first idea.

209
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,000
[EREN] You've got fifteen
seconds to decide.

210
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,916
[EREN] Think you
can get it done?

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,458
[EREN] Listen, I'll respect
your opinion either way.

212
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,500
[ARMIN] Eren. Why
would you leave such

213
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,208
a major decision up to me?

214
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,458
[EREN] Because you
keep a level head.

215
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,875
You always choose well, no
matter how ugly things get.

216
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,708
I figure that's
worth relying on.

217
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,041
W-When have I done that?

218
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,875
C'mon, you do it all the
time. Take five years ago.

219
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,708
[EREN] If you hadn't gone
to Mr. Hannes for help,

220
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,375
[EREN] Mikasa and I would've
been eaten by the Titans.

221
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,333
[ARMIN] That's how you see me?

222
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:44,125
[ARMIN] You don't think I'm
a poor excuse for a friend?

223
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,458
[ARMIN] I had convinced
myself that I was

224
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,875
[ARMIN] just a
burden to all of you.

225
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,000
[ARMIN] But you never--

226
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,583
[ARMIN] You never thought
of me that way at all!

227
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,916
Armin!

228
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,166
[EREN] Our time's up!

229
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,500
[RICO] Artillery crew
has reloaded, Captain!

230
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,041
It's your call, sir.

231
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,250
[ARMIN] Eren and Mikasa
have enough faith in me to

232
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,000
[ARMIN] put their lives
in my hands, and I have

233
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,083
[ARMIN] complete
trust in the two of them.

234
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,250
[ARMIN] More than
anyone else in this world.

235
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:18,583
[ARMIN] And that fact alone
is all the convincing I need!

236
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,625
[ARMIN] I will
persuade them, trust me.

237
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,500
You two just act
as non-aggressively

238
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,833
as you possibly can, agreed?

239
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,750
[ARMIN] Since Eren first
appeared and fought as a Titan,

240
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,416
[ARMIN] something has been
gnawing at the back of my mind.

241
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,541
[ARMIN] I haven't had a chance
to collect my thoughts yet,

242
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,708
[ARMIN] but I can do this!

243
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,791
[ARMIN] I'll just
have to think as I talk!

244
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,708
Halt! Halt!

245
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,125
[WOERMAN] Is this supposed
to be your true form, Monster?

246
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,458
[WOERMAN] I don't buy it!

247
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,458
[WOERMAN] I'll give the
signal to fire, I mean it!

248
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,041
Eren is not a foe of humanity!

249
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,375
We're willing to cooperate
with Military Command

250
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,833
and share everything we've
learned about his powers!

251
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,833
Your pleas fall on deaf ears!

252
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,375
He revealed his true form,

253
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,791
and because of that threat,
he cannot leave here alive!

254
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,166
[WOERMAN] If you
insist that he's not

255
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,916
[WOERMAN] an enemy
of ours, show me proof!

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,666
[WOERMAN] Otherwise,
we'll blast him back to

257
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,375
[WOERMAN] whatever
nightmare he crawled out of!

258
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,708
You don't need any proof!

259
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,625
[ARMIN] That's right!
There's no need at all!

260
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,166
[ARMIN] The fact
of the matter is

261
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,375
[ARMIN] it doesn't matter
what we perceive him to be!

262
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,583
[WOERMAN] What?

263
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,208
The reports say hundreds
of soldiers saw him.

264
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,416
[ARMIN] And those
who were there say

265
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,125
[ARMIN] they saw him
fighting other Titans!

266
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,333
[ARMIN] And that
means they saw him

267
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,541
[ARMIN] get swarmed
by the Titans as well.

268
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,208
To put it plainly, the
Titans saw him the same way

269
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,208
they see each and every
human being; as their prey!

270
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,833
And it doesn't matter
how else you may look at it!

271
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,416
That is an irrefutable fact!

272
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,375
[MALE GARRISON]
Kid's gotta point.

273
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,083
[WOERAN] Prepare to attack!

274
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,125
[WOERMAN] Don't let yourself
be swayed by his cunning lies!

275
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,458
[WOERMAN] The Titan's
behavior has always been

276
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,000
[WOERMAN] beyond
our comprehension.

277
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,041
[WOERMAN] I wouldn't put it
past 'em to assume human form.

278
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,541
[WOERMAN] He's
speaking our language

279
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,041
[WOERMAN] in an
attempt to deceive us!

280
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,708
I refuse to let them continue
this behavior unchecked!

281
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,291
[ARMIN] It's hopeless.

282
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,125
[ARMIN] He let logic
give way to hysteria!

283
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,916
[ARMIN] Too frightened
to think it through.

284
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,000
[ARMIN] Eren! Mikasa!

285
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,791
I am a soldier!

286
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,291
And I have dedicated my heart

287
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,083
to the restoration
of humanity, sir!

288
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,833
[ARMIN] Nothing
could make me prouder

289
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,625
[ARMIN] than dying
for such a noble cause!

290
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,666
[ARMIN] If we were to use his
Titan ability and combine it

291
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,750
[ARMIN] with the
manpower we have left,

292
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,333
[ARMIN] I believe we can do it!

293
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,666
[ARMIN] We can retake this city!

294
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,333
[ARMIN] For humanity's glory,

295
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,708
[ARMIN] in what little
time I have left to live,

296
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,250
I will advocate
his strategic value!

297
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,208
[IAN] Captain Woerman.
His words are worth

298
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,875
[IAN] considering, sir.
Maybe we should--

299
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,416
Quiet! 

300
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,750
[WOERMAN] Don't let
their words sway you.

301
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,333
[WOERMAN] They're all traitors!

302
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,208
[WOERMAN] I swore
an oath as an officer.

303
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,833
[WOERMAN] I will crush
all insubordination!

304
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,875
[MAN] That's enough.

305
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,791
[MAN] You should really
do something about your

306
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,041
[MAN] nervous disposition,
Captain Woerman.

307
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,666
[WOERMAN] C-Commander Pyxis?

308
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,333
[PYXIS] Can you not see this
soldier's heartfelt salute?

309
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,458
I've only just arrived,

310
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,500
but I'm quite aware
of our situation.

311
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,916
Gather our reinforcements.

312
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,708
I think we could at least
do these young soldiers

313
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,125
[PYXIS] the favor
of hearing them out.

314
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,916
[NARRATOR] According to reports
from the Scout Regiment,

315
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,458
[NARRATOR] it was
anticipated that the Titans

316
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,583
[NARRATOR] would
appear from the south.

317
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,333
[NARRATOR] These reports
were proven accurate when

318
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,500
[NARRATOR] the Titans
attacked Shiganshina District,

319
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,500
[NARRATOR] located on the
south side of Wall Maria.

320
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,166
[NARRATOR] Therefore, it
was surmised that their next

321
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,541
[NARRATOR] most
likely target would be

322
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
[NARRATOR] the
fortified city of Trost,

323
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,000
[NARRATOR] on the
southern side of Wall Rose.

324
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,333
[NARRATOR] Dot Pyxis.
The commanding officer

325
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,000
[NARRATOR] responsible
for the southern territory.

326
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,125
[NARRATOR] The man in charge of
the defense of Trost district.

327
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,416
[NARRATOR] The man given
full authority over preserving

328
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,000
[NARRATOR] humanity's most
vital remaining territory.

329
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,666
[PYXIS] Nope. Not any of you.

330
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,958
Eaten by a Titan
wouldn't be so bad,

331
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,333
if it was a sexy lady one.

332
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,916
[NARRATOR] The man
also notorious for

333
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,416
[NARRATOR] being
genuinely eccentric.

334
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,125
[WOERMAN] What the
hell is going through

335
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,375
[WOERMAN] the Commander's head?

336
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,083
Going up there
with those freaks

337
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,416
[WOERMAN] and not
bringing any bodyguards!

338
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,750
Well, sir. That's the Commander.

339
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,041
He's well known for taking
a less traditional approach.

340
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,750
[IAN] Captain Woerman.

341
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,166
We have finished
assembling the troops, sir.

342
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,708
[WOERMAN] Ah. Well done.

343
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,666
[PYXIS] That's that.
So, visiting this cellar

344
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,000
[PYXIS] should
clear everything up?

345
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,250
Yes, sir. Well,
at least I think so.

346
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,208
[PYXIS] For the moment,
there is no way to validate

347
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,416
[PYXIS] all of the
claims you've made.

348
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,250
For now, I'll just
catalogue them in here.

349
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,791
With that said,

350
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,416
[PYXIS] I can usually
tell the difference

351
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,833
[PYXIS] between the
unctuous and the sincere,

352
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,458
[PYXIS] which
is why I personally

353
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,750
[PYXIS] guarantee your safety.

354
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,416
[PYXIS] You're Cadet Armin
Arlelt. Is that correct?

355
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,666
[ARMIN] Yes sir!

356
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,458
[PYXIS] You mentioned
a plan to harness this

357
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,208
[PYXIS] so-called "Titan
Ability" and then utilize

358
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,833
your friend's power
to retake the city.

359
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,166
Do you believe it
could work? Or were you

360
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,000
grasping at straws to
try and save your hides?

361
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:33,000
Uh, well-- Both, Commander.

362
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,541
[ARMIN] I was going
to suggest that Eren,

363
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,541
[ARMIN] using his
strength as a Titan,

364
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,875
[ARMIN] could lift
that giant boulder.

365
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,625
[ARMIN] We could use it to
block off the wrecked gate.

366
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,166
That was the best
idea I was able to

367
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,375
[ARMIN] come up
with on the spot.

368
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,541
[ARMIN] I-I just wanted
to make everyone see how

369
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,333
[ARMIN] Eren's ability
might provide a solution

370
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,083
[ARMIN] to the
problem we all face.

371
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,125
Hm.

372
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,583
[ARMIN] Granted, I was
pretty desperate to survive.

373
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,208
"Desperate to survive," huh?

374
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,333
That's as credible
a reason as any, son.

375
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,166
[PYXIS] Ahhhh.

376
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,041
[PYXIS] What do
you say, Cadet Jaeger?

377
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,458
Say, sir?

378
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,708
That hole. Do you think
that you can plug it up, son?

379
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,375
Well, I-- I don't know.

380
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:32,375
[EREN] It's possible.
But at the moment, I don't

381
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,708
[EREN] understand my
power any more than you do.

382
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,416
It's just, I sort
of feel irresponsible

383
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,208
giving you an answer,
'cause I don't really know.

384
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,166
[PYXIS] Ah, yes. Of
course, my apologies.

385
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,541
[PYXIS] I asked you
the wrong question.

386
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,833
Are you willing to,
Cadet Jaeger. Or not?

387
00:21:53,458 --> 00:22:03,416
♪

388
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:13,458
♪

389
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:21,625
♪

390
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,458
[EREN] I'll do it.

391
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,541
I'll do it!

392
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,375
I don't know if I
can seal that hole.

393
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,041
[EREN] But... I'll do it!

394
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,750
[NARRATOR] Despite having
fled in terror before,

395
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,583
[NARRATOR] the survivors
choose to stand on

396
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,875
[NARRATOR] the field
of battle once again.

397
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,000
[NARRATOR]
Eren's mind is made up.

398
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,458
[NARRATOR] "I will
be everyone's hope."
