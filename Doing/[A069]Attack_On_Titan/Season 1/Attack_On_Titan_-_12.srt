1
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,041
[NARRATOR] In the year 845,

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,083
[NARRATOR] two terrifying
new breeds of Titan appeared:

3
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,041
[NARRATOR] the
Colossal and the Armored,

4
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,708
[NARRATOR] barreling through
the outer walls as if

5
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,458
[NARRATOR] wholesale
destruction was child's play.

6
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,125
[NARRATOR] The
territory couched within

7
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,875
[NARRATOR] the circle of
Wall Maria was abandoned.

8
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,833
[NARRATOR] Twenty percent
of the human race perished.

9
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,750
[NARRATOR] As the
Titan onslaught advanced,

10
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:46,000
[NARRATOR] our only choice was
to withdrawal behind Wall Rose.

11
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,625
[NARRATOR] In the year 850, the
Colossal Titan again appeared

12
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,583
[NARRATOR] and decimated
yet another barrier

13
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,750
[NARRATOR] between us and them.

14
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,250
[NARRATOR] Once more,
mankind retreated in panic

15
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,166
[NARRATOR] before the
advance of its greatest foe.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,833
[NARRATOR] Brave soul
after brave soul perished.

17
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,708
[NARRATOR] Eaten alive.

18
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:06,208
Eren! No!

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,416
[NARRATOR] Cadet Eren
Jaeger, tragically consumed

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,125
[NARRATOR] early
on in the battle...

21
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,000
[NARRATOR] later
emerged miraculously

22
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,750
[NARRATOR] from the
fallen body of an Abnormal.

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,208
Attention!

24
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,416
[NARRATOR] Dot Pyxis,
unconventional commander

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,333
[NARRATOR] of the entire
Southern Territory,

26
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,333
[NARRATOR] witnessed firsthand
Eren's Titan form in action.

27
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,583
[NARRATOR] Taking note of
the boy's incredible strength,

28
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,166
[NARRATOR] a plan
worthy of the commander's

29
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,458
[NARRATOR] fabled
eccentricity was hatched.

30
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,666
[PYXIS] Recall
the massive boulder

31
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,416
[PYXIS] roughly a
league from the gate.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,708
[PYXIS] Having assumed
Titan form, Cadet Jaeger

33
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,708
[PYXIS] will hoist said
boulder on his back,

34
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,125
[PYXIS] schlep it
to the hole, and voila!

35
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,916
[PYXIS] Should we succeed,
history will be made!

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,333
[PYXIS] Today is the day!

37
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,833
[PYXIS] Trost regain
shall stand as a reclamation

38
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,083
[PYXIS] of pride
and hope beyond measure!

39
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,375
[PYXIS] A leap greater
than we have ever taken!

40
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,333
[roaring]

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,916
[NARRATOR] And yet, despite
Eren's ironclad resolve,

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,166
[NARRATOR] the plan teetered
on the brink of collapse

43
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,750
[NARRATOR] even as it began.

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,875
[GUSTAV] We've managed to
corral most of the Titans

45
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,333
[GUSTAV] in the corner
furthest from the breach.

46
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,125
[GUSTAV] Combat has been
avoided as much as possible.

47
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,833
[GUSTAV] But still,
20% of our forces are lost.

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
[PYXIS] Not lost.

49
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,500
[PYXIS] They did not
die of losing their way.

50
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,708
[PYXIS] They were sent
to their deaths. By me.

51
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,958
[PYXIS] This is the threshold
of our extinction, soldiers.

52
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,291
[PYXIS] If my actions
ensure mankind's survival,

53
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,291
[PYXIS] history may call
me "butcher" all it wants.

54
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,291
Ackerman, look out!

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,958
Hey! Ackerman!
Stand down! Now!

56
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,791
Get away from him.
That's an order!

57
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,291
Eren! I know you're
in there somewhere.

58
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,125
I know you recognize me!

59
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,750
[MIKASA] That's
right! Come on!

60
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,291
[MIKASA] Snap
the hell out of it!

61
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,000
[MIKASA] We've got
a breach to seal up!

62
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,333
[RICO] We've failed.

63
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,666
It was foolish to pin our hopes

64
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,208
on something we
didn't fully understand.

65
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,333
[gun shot]

66
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:26,125
[MIKASA] Eren! Listen
to me! You're human!

67
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,583
Get out of there!

68
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,791
[MITABI] What the hell?

69
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,166
You tellin' me the kid was
a regular Titan all along?

70
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,166
Eren!

71
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,500
[ELITE E] Captain!

72
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,541
[ELITE E] We've got two
Titans bearing down on us

73
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,291
[ELITE E] from the front;
a 10-meter and a 6-meter!

74
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,791
[ELITE F] Heads up!
There's a 12-meter

75
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,791
[ELITE F] closing in
on us from the rear!

76
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,458
Ian, that's it.
Please. Just look at him.

77
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,541
We need to get out of
here; the plan's a bust.

78
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,791
Agreed. Full withdrawal.

79
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,916
We have to leave him as he is.

80
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,125
[ELITE A] Red smoke.
That's not good.

81
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,750
Sir, at best
I'm afraid it means

82
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,083
the elite squad
hit quite a snag.

83
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,125
[ELITE B] This was pointless.

84
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,708
[ELITE B] My friends
died like animals.

85
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,125
[SOLDIER 1] No!
Look! Over there!

86
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,250
[SOLDIER 2] What?
What's happening?

87
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,791
[MARCO] It's over.

88
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,166
They failed.

89
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,708
But, how?

90
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,166
[MARCO] Whoa! Armin!
Where are you going?

91
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,708
[ELITE A] Commander.

92
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,500
I recommend we revert
back to defending the gate.

93
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,250
Just give the word, sir.

94
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,708
[PYXIS] Denied.

95
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,708
Sir, shall I order a retreat?

96
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,875
[PYXIS] Absolutely not.

97
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,791
Continue luring the
enemy to the edge of town.

98
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,333
The Elite Squad is well-helmed;

99
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,791
they have leave to
make their own decisions.

100
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,500
[PYXIS] We proceed as planned.

101
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,625
[PYXIS] This was an
all-or-nothing proposition.

102
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,791
[PYXIS] I will allow those
at the vanguard to determine

103
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,500
[PYXIS] if and when we deviate.

104
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,875
[PYXIS] We are not in a position
to deliver a verdict of defeat.

105
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,083
But, we are in a position
to fight to the last breath.

106
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,583
It's humanity's debt.
It's what we owe the fallen.

107
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,541
[MITABI] Ian! Snap out of it!
What are you waiting for?

108
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,666
[MITABI] Give the order!

109
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,333
Hey, it's not like
this is your fault!

110
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,375
Come on! Look, this plan
was doomed from the start!

111
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,708
[MITABI] We all get that.
Was it worth a shot?

112
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,958
[MITABI] Sure, whatever!

113
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,750
[MITABI] We did the
best with what we had!

114
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,916
[MITABI] But all
we've got left now

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,791
[MITABI] is going
back over the wall.

116
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,166
[IAN] Stop!

117
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,000
Easy. Now's not the time.

118
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,541
[IAN] Team Rico,
take out the 12-meter

119
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,083
[IAN] approaching from behind.

120
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,000
[IAN] Team Mitabi and I will
handle the two front-runners.

121
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,416
Are you nuts?

122
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,416
[IAN] In case you've forgotten,
I'm the one in charge!

123
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,375
Now do as you're
ordered, soldier!

124
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,166
We are not leaving
Jaeger defenseless, period.

125
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,666
[IAN] Change of plans.
Our job now is to keep

126
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,958
[IAN] the others off him
until he can be recovered.

127
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,583
Whether we like it or not,
he's still our last best chance.

128
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,583
[IAN] We're not
about to abandon him.

129
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,625
[IAN] We're
expendable; he isn't.

130
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,750
[IAN] He can't just be replaced.

131
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,708
Please! Don't talk to me
about our last best chance!

132
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,666
He's a failure countless
soldiers have died because of!

133
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,333
Just look at him,
Ian! Are you saying

134
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,625
you want more of
us to die saving that?

135
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,125
That's right.
Down to the last man!

136
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,250
If that's what
it takes, so be it!

137
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,041
What the hell's
up with the red smoke.

138
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,166
What happened to him?

139
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,500
I don't know, but
Armin's gone to see.

140
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,958
But I-- I think
it'll be alright.

141
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah?

142
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,458
Of course! I mean...

143
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,041
[MARCO] this is Eren
we're talkin' about.

144
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,375
Right.

145
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,041
I don't wanna be that guy,

146
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,875
but this whole thing
feels kind of pointless.

147
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,791
Hell, when's the last time
a fight against the Titans

148
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,500
didn't feel like that,
huh? The best thing now?

149
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,041
Do what we can
from losing any more.

150
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,625
[CONNY] I don't like
the idea of so many of us

151
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,208
[CONNY] being dead for nothing.

152
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,916
[JEAN] We have
to pick our battles.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,916
[JEAN] If we want to
wage all-out war someday,

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,250
[JEAN] we have to conserve
all the manpower we can.

155
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,791
[JEAN] This was the right call.

156
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,375
Just be patient.

157
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,791
[CONNY] Was it the
right call, though?

158
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,041
Yes! Of course it was!

159
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,625
[CONNY] Live to fight
another day, is that it?

160
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,625
Right. I'm in.

161
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,125
[RICO] Ian, you
can't be serious!

162
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,125
[IAN] What other hope
against the Titans do we have?

163
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,916
[IAN] You know
something I don't?

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,958
This is it.
This is all we've got,

165
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,250
and you damn-well know it!

166
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,125
I am making a
judgment call here.

167
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,000
If you have a
better plan, speak up!

168
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,500
[IAN] How else are we
ever going to get out from

169
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,958
[IAN] under their feet?
I'm all ears here!

170
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,250
If you're asking me how
else we'll defeat the Titans,

171
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,000
obviously I have no idea.

172
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,833
See? That's why we can't
afford to beat a retreat.

173
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,458
Not just yet.

174
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,458
[IAN] We may not know
what else is in there,

175
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,208
[IAN] but there's hope.

176
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,083
And as long as that's the case.

177
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,666
We're gonna fight
to the bitter end.

178
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,208
[IAN] Look at us.
Always scraping by.

179
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,375
[IAN] Always on the run.

180
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,625
[IAN] Don't you-- Don't
you want it to be over?

181
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,000
[IAN] Don't you
want to make a stand?

182
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,541
[IAN] Well, this
is how it's done!

183
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,083
This is just-- This is madness.

184
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,666
Hey!

185
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,125
[RICO] I think you're right.

186
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,708
[RICO] If we're to stand,
this is the only way.

187
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,125
Just this once.

188
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,375
Let's fight a fight that's
not just a battle of attrition.

189
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,125
Let the bastards
taste humanity's wrath.

190
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,333
Right. My team will
address the 12-meter Titan

191
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,041
[RICO] coming from the rear.

192
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,166
[MITABI] Well? We got the
two in front or don't we?

193
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,291
Right.

194
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,625
Thank you, Captain.
That was brave.

195
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,708
No, it wasn't.
There's no thanks needed.

196
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,916
Fact of the matter
is I was petrified of

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,833
the mess you were
about to get into.

198
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,875
But you're free
now. So do your thing.

199
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,958
Make good use of
that inborn skill.

200
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,500
Sir.

201
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,083
[IAN] Go save the man you love.

202
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,875
It's not like that.

203
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,750
[MIKASA] What? Why haven't his
injuries repaired themselves?

204
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,208
[MIKASA] Did the earlier
damage compromise him?

205
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,500
[MIKASA] Oh, Eren. What
is this doing to you?

206
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,708
[MIKASA] Oh god, what if you
won't be able to change back?

207
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,166
[MIKASA] No, I've got to stop.

208
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,750
[MIKASA] I'm thinking about
it too much, that's all.

209
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,500

to focus on doing.

210
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,083
[ARMIN] Eren. Misaka.
What's going on?

211
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,416
[EREN] What's-- Where am I?

212
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,333
[EREN] What am--
What am I doing?

213
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,375
[EREN] Am I sitting?

214
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,333
[EREN] I can't see.

215
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,916
[EREN] What day is it?

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,875
[EREN] Wait.

217
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:03,125
[EREN] Oh. That's
right, of course.

218
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,208
[EREN] Weird.

219
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,166
[ARMIN] Eren.

220
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,875
Come on, what are
you doing? Wake up!

221
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,125
[ELITE C] Here's the plan:

222
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,458
[ELITE C] we don't let
a single one of these

223
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,791
[ELITE C] ugly S.O.B.'s
wander outta this corner.

224
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,208
[ELITE C] Focus
on luring them here

225
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,916
[ELITE C] and keeping
them here, understood?

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,583
[ELITE C] Do not, I repeat,
do not engage them in combat

227
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,625
[ELITE C] unless you
absolutely have to.

228
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,333
[ELITE C] I want you on the
ground, three cadets per team.

229
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,625
When you reach the
wall, jump. That clear?

230
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,375
Die, and you'll piss me off.

231
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,083
[ELITE C] If a Titan goes
astray, we'll put him down.

232
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,291
Whaddya mean "if"?
It's not like we can

233
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,416
count on them
to follow protocol.

234
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,375
[ANNIE] What if our
situation gets risky?

235
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,208
Are we free to act at
our own discretion or what?

236
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,333
[ELITE C] Whatever'll
make it easier on you.

237
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,250

Kirschtein, move out!

Son of a bitch-- Behind us!

240

[ELITE E] It's a 13-meter!
And from the looks of it,

241
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,000
[ELITE E] he's about
to pounce on Jaeger!

242
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,250
[ELITE F] Heads up!
We've got four more

243
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,625
[ELITE F] coming
through the gate!

them 10-meters at least!

Right. Rear! Ackerman! Yours!

Keep it away from
him at all costs!

248
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,750
Hold the rest off here!

249
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,875
Will do!

250
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,416
[MIKASA] Elite or
not, two teams can't

251
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,541

four Titans at once.

252
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,416

[MIKASA] Where are they
coming from all of a sudden?

254
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,416
[MIKASA] There aren't enough
of us to attract this many.

they're coming for Eren!

[ARMIN] Mikasa!

257
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,083
Why'd the plan go belly-up?

258

[MIKASA] Armin?

259
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,125
Why on earth is he
just slumped here like this?

260
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,875
[MIKASA] Get away.
It's dangerous!

261
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,125
[MIKASA] Something went wrong.

262
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,000
[MIKASA] He lost control
and wound up like that!

263
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,208
[MIKASA] I tried
to snap him out of it,

264
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,791
[MIKASA] but I couldn't
get him to respond.

265
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,125
[MIKASA] He's been out like
this for the past few minutes.

[ARMIN] But the plan?

267
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,375
[MIKASA] We've had to shift
tac. Right now all we can do

268
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,583
[MIKASA] is protect him.
He's defenseless.

There's just so many.
