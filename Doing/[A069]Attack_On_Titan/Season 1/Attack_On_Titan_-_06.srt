1
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:57,125
Wake up! Armin! Hey!

2
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,083
[CONNY] Can you hear me? C'mon!

3
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:03,833
Snap out of it! I need you
to talk to me! Say something!

4
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,833
[CONNY] There you
are. You with me now?

5
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,166
[CONNY] What's going
on? Where's your squad?

6
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,791
[ARMIN] Squad?

7
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,708
Alright, let's
get you on your feet.

8
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,416
You shouldn't
be out here alone.

9
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,041
And what the hell you got all
over you that's so damn slimy?

10
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,708
[CONNY] What happened?

11
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,458
[Armin screaming]

12
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,875
You're worthless!
Why can't you just die?

13
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,500
Hey, you need to
pull yourself together!

14
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,541
Damn you!

15
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,541
[CONNY] Where is everyone?

16
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,875
[YMIR] Let it go, Conny.

17
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,375
He's it. There
rest of 'em are dead.

18
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,916
Damn it, don't talk like that!

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,583
We can't assume
he's the only one!

20
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,583
Take a look around
you; isn't it obvious?

21
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,583
We can't waste any
more time here with him.

22
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,125
We've gotta move on.

23
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,083
You're not making any sense.
Why would the Titans ignore him?

24
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,666
I dunno. Maybe they thought he
was already dead or something.

25
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,875
When you get right down to it,
that's the real tragedy here.

26
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,625
[YMIR] Eren and the
others bust their asses,

27
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,583
[YMIR] and the one
left standing is him.

28
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,833
Alright. That does it, bitch.

29
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,875
I'm gonna shut your
mouth up permanently!

30
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,916
Both of you stop it right now!

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,500
Look, we're all at the
end of our tether, okay?

32
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,000
We're seeing our friends
being killed like animals.

33
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,708
It's normal to be upset.

34
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,708
Look at my Christa
keepin' the peace!

35
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,416
You're so gonna
have to marry me

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,958
when all this crap
is over! [laughing]

37
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,541
[CONNY] Yeah, well...

38
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,916
She'd best get a
hold of that mouth.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,833
Alright. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

40
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,333
Are you able to stand?

41
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:36,291
Sorry to be a nuisance.
Don't worry about me.

42
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,541
I'll rendezvous
with the rear guard.

43
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,291
But-- Armin!

44
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,208
[MALE CADET] Conny, hop to!

45
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,833
[MALE CADET] We've been
given orders to advance!

46
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,958
[ARMIN] I was wrong. This
world hasn't become hell.

47
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:01,083
It's been hell. I just
couldn't see it before now.

48
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:07,416
We're condemned. All of us.
Have been from the beginning.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,791
[ARMIN] Strength
preys on weakness.

50
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,000
[ARMIN] It's a very
straightforward

51
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,208
[ARMIN] arrangement, actually.

52
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,666
[ARMIN] And my
friends... They--

53
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:26,291
[ARMIN] They tried. They
knew how the world worked.

54
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:32,083
[ARMIN] They wanted
to be strong. For me.

55
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,875
[ARMIN] Someone who
only brought them down.

56
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,083
[ARMIN] In their
eyes, I was a victim.

57
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,416
[ARMIN] I needed protection.

58
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,250
[ARMIN] But all I
wanted was to stand

59
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,791
[ARMIN] shoulder-
to-shoulder with them;

60
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,375
[ARMIN] to be strong,
like they were.

61
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,791
[ARMIN] To be worth something.

62
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,708
[ARMIN] And this
is how it all ends up.

63
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,541
[ARMIN] Eren tried
to protect me and--

64
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,416
Hanna. What are
you trying to do?

65
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,458
Oh god, Armin! Help me, please!

66
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,458
Franz quit breathing
and I can't wake him up!

67
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,375
[HANNA] He won't respond
to CPR! Come on, baby!

68
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,125
[HANNA] You got
this! Stay with me!

69
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,541
Somebody help us!

70
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,666
Hanna, please. It's
not safe on the ground,

71
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,875
we need to get
you on a rooftop--

72
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,375
[HANNA] No! I'm not
leaving him like this!

73
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,125
You really don't
understand, do you?

74
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,583
Hanna, I'm sorry. Franz is-

75
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,833
Please stop.
Please stop doing that.

76
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,041
[ARMIN] I can't.

77
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,000
[ARMIN] I-- I can't take it.

78
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,208
[ARMIN] This is hell.

79
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,666
[frantic shouting]

80
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,000
What in the hell is wrong with
you people? I don't think you

81
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,750
fully appreciate how
bad the situation is!

82
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,958
Oh, I appreciate it just fine,
believe me! You wanna make it

83
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,291
out of here alive,
stop whining and help!

84
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:23,125
[crowd shouting]

85
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,833
You're a soldier! Do something!

86
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,708
Make him move that damn wagon!

87
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,041
I'm not exactly sure--

88
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,125
Take your best
shot, little man.

89
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,666
I'm the president of
this town's merchant guild.

90
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,708
Uh-- Well, I--

91
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,791
Who do you think pays all
the bills for the food you

92
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,458
and your buddies crap out?
Or maybe you've got some

93
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,791
finances tucked away to fund
the racket you call a job?

94
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,375
Now shut up and push!
This cargo's worth more than

95
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,208
you people make
in your whole lives!

96
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,583
[MERCHANT] Nobody's
getting out of here unless

97
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,875
[MERCHANT] the
wagon's in front of 'em!

98
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,250
[MERCHANT] There's a
reward in it if you help!

99
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,875
[WOMAN] Don't worry, sweetheart.

100
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,416
[WOMAN] Daddy's
going to use those big,

101
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,208
[WOMAN] loud cannons he showed
us to scare the Titans off.

102
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,500
Mommie, look. There.

103
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,500
[screaming]

104
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,791
Push it through, dammit!

105
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,750
If you don't, that
thing's gonna kill us all!

106
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,666
[WOMAN] Stop! You'll
trample the children!

107
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,375
Someone wanna tell me why the
son of a bitch is ignoring us?

108
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,833
It's an Abnormal; stop
trying to figure him out!

109
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,000
He's too fast! There's
no way we'll overtake him

110
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,083
before he reaches the gate!

111
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,708
Just stay on him!

112
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,083
[MIKASA] Excuse me.
What is all this?

113
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,000
Couldn't have asked
for better timing!

114
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,666
Force these useless
morons to push my wagon!

115
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,666
I'll pay you handsomely!

116
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:09,083
Seriously? Soldiers
are dying back there.

117
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,875
Laying down
their lives for you.

118
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,833
All because this
is taking too long.

119
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,541
Yeah, that's their job.
You expect me to shed a tear

120
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,958
'cause they gotta fulfill
the duties they signed on for?

121
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,250
They're supposed to be willing
to lay down their lives!

122
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,291
Don't get all high-handed
on me just 'cause you finally

123
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,458
gotta earn your damn
keep after all these years!

124
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,708
[quiet chatter]

125
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:39,541
Yeah. No arguing with that.
You're absolutely right, sir.

126
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:43,125
Guess it's what you call
the greater good. Still.

127
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,000
Sometimes it's not
the life or the death

128
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,750
of a soldier that makes
the biggest difference.

129
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't you even dare! Your
commander and I are old friends!

130
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,625
One word from me and
you'll be court marshaled!

131
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,083
[MERCHANT] Believe it!

132
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,291
That word gonna come
from beyond the grave?

133
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,333
No! Wait!

134
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,250
Sir, maybe we should uh--

135
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,333
Pull the damn wagon out.

136
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:24,541
[chatter]

137
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,791
[GIRL] You're amazing!

138
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:32,041
You've saved our lives, miss.
All of us are in your debt.

139
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,750
[IAN] Good work,
Ackerman. I'm impressed.

140
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,375
[MIKASA] I did what I could
here, sir. But, thank you.

141
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,750
I need to be a bit more
careful in the future.

142
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,166
I inadvertently dulled
both of the blades.

143
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,958
I'll do better next time.

144
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,333
What on earth have
you had to live through

145
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,500
to be so non-chalant.

146
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,416
I'm sorry. That
was uncalled for.

147
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,416
Why do I have to
suddenly think of you now?

148
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,333
[MIKASA] I'm finished, Momma!

149
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,416
What do you think?
Did I do good?

150
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,541
Oh, darling. It's absolutely
fantastic! Excellent work!

151
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,916
Aww, thank you!

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,083
We've kept this style of
embroidery a special family

153
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,791
secret for heaven knows
how many generations.

154
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,583
One day, when you have
children of your own,

155
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,833
you'll be able to
pass the secret on to them.

156
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,208
Huh? I don't understand;
how can I have children?

157
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,958
[MIKASA'S MOM] Uh. Honey,
why don't you explain?

158
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,416
Yeah! Please, Daddy?

159
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,375
Well I'm not sure I'm really
an expert on the subject.

160
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,583
But you know what? That nice
Dr. Jaeger's scheduled to

161
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,750
pay us a visit today.
Maybe you could talk to him.

162
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,125
[knock-knock]

163
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,333
[MIKASA'S DAD] Ah!
Speak of the devil!

164
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,791
[knock-knock]

165
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,875
[MIKASA'S DAD] Just a moment.

166
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,166
[knock-knock]

167
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,500
[EREN] Her name's Mikasa?

168
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,333
Yes, and she's
just about your age,

169
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,958
so try to get along, okay?

170
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,666
There aren't really that
many children around here

171
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,625
and I'd rather you not
grow up to be an outcast.

172
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,416
If she's nice to me, then
we won't have a problem.

173
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,250
Eren. Look for
the bad in people

174
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,875
expecting to find
it and you will.

175
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,833
That's odd. Are they home?

176
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,875
[knocking] Mr. Ackermann!
It's Dr. Jaeger!

177
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,791
Is anyone there?

178
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,041
Well are they or aren't they?

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,958
[EREN] Dad? What's wrong?

180
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,000
[GRISHA] Damn it.

181
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,958
Look around. Can you
see the daughter anywhere?

182
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,791
Perhaps she's outside.

183
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,416
[EREN] I don't think so.

184
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,541
This is bad. I need to alert
the Military Police of this

185
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,416
while the trail's warm. Wait for
me at the foot of the mountain.

186
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,750
[GRISHA] Understood? Say that
back to me. Word for word.

187
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,375
[GRISHA] Eren!

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
[MAN 1] Uh-huh. All I'm
sayin' is she better go

189
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,458
[MAN 1] for a decent price.

190
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,375
[MAN 1] I didn't get blood
on my hands for nothing.

191
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,375
Look at her face and
tell me what's she's worth.

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,583
[MAN 1] Sure, she's cute
and all. Just young.

193
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,250
[MAN 1] Wouldn't
go for her myself.

194
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,291
Then I guess we're lucky you're
not the one we're sellin' to.

195
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,500
Plenty of folks'd
pay a premium.

196
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,708
She's exotic; what they
used to call an "Oriental."

197
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,250
You know about all that, right?
Back when there used to be

198
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,958
different breeds of
people. A bunch of 'em from

199
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,291
the Far East came
scramblin' here for safety.

200
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,708
[MAN 2] The old
perverts in the capital

201
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,500
[MAN 2] really go for
that sort of thing.

202
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,916
[MAN 2] This li'l beauty's
gonna fetch a mint at auction.

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,541
[MAN 2] It's great business;
she's the last of her kind.

204
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,666
[MAN 2] All the rest
of her people died out.

205
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,875
Tell me another one.

206
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,750
It's not like she's
a pureblood or anything.

207
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,791
Her old man wasn't "Oriental."

208
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,125
Good point there.

209
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,375
The mother would've been
a nice addition, right?

210
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,041
Too bad she's in pieces!

211
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,041
Gimme a break! What
was I supposed to do?

212
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,583
She was puttin' up a fight!

213
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,166
[MAN 2] So you couldn't have
just knocked her unconscious?

214
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,416
[knock-knock]

215
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,125
We were just talking
about you, Doctor--

216
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,791
Sorry. Hope we're
not interrupting.

217
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,750
[MAN 1] Let's take this nice and
easy. I don't imagine anybody

218
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,458
[MAN 1] wants their skulls
split open by this little guy--

219
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,291
[struggling scream]

220
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,333
This bitch is out of her mind!

221
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,125
Run, Mikasa! Run
as fast as you can!

222
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,791
Stop it; you're scaring me.

223
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:33,041
I want you to be scared!
Move it! Get away from here!

224
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:33,750
[struggling screams]

225
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,416
[MIKASA] Dad?

226
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,708
Screw it. You
ain't worth this crap!

227
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:54,125
You stupid bastard! The plan
was to only kill the father!

228
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,791
She was nuts!
I'm supposed to let her

229
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,250
[MAN 1] gouge my eyes
out with those shears?

230
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,791
[MAN 2] I don't want to
hear it! Just bag the kid!

231
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,041
[MAN 1] Fine!

232
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:07,375
[MAN 1] Hey. Let's not give
me any attitude, alright?

233
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,000
If you're feelin' feisty,
this is what you get.

234
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,458
So cold.

235
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,750
[EREN] Oh, I'm sorry.

236
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,375
[MAN 1] Don't move from
that spot, you little vermin.

237
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,500
How did you even
you find this place?

238
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:46,833
Uh. Well, I was in
the woods and got lost.

239
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,541
[EREN] I saw your cabin and--

240
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,208
Lost in the woods, huh? A kid
your age shouldn't be out there

241
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,458
on his own to begin with.
Big bad wolves are liable to

242
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,958
[MAN 1] pounce on
you from outta nowhere.

243
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,375
It's alright now, though;
you'll be safe here.

244
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,291
My buddy and I'll
be happy to take y--

245
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,083
[EREN] I appreciate that,
sir. But I'm not stupid.

246
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,916
And I'm the last
thing you'll ever see.

247
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,875
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

248
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,250
Hey, you little
bastard! Get back here!

249
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,750
[Eren screaming]

250
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:36,666
[EREN] You're an animal! You
hear me? No! You're a disease!

251
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,666
This is what you get,
you son of a bitch!

252
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,583
This is what you get
for being what you are!

253
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,500
Die! Die!

254
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:03,916
The hard part's
over. You're safe now.

255
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,458
Anyway, Mikasa, right?

256
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:13,166
My name's Eren.
I'm Dr. Jaeger's son.

257
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,541
I met your folks once or
twice while I was with him.

258
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,625
[EREN] We were stopping by
your house today for a checkup.

259
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,083
[EREN] We saw...

260
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,500
What happened
to the third one?

261
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,625
This is all
your doing, isn't it?

262
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,333
[MAN] Answer me, you little
bastard! You did this!

263
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,708
I'm gonna kill you!
You're gonna die!

264
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,583
Take-- Take him out.

265
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,416
[EREN] Fight!

266
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,000
Kill or be killed.
Fight for your life!

267
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,875
[EREN] It's--
It's the only way.

268
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,041
Who the hell do you think
you are, you little brat?

269
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:07,625
[EREN] The only way
to live is to fight!

270
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,875
I can't. I don't
think I can do this.

271
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:27,041
[MIKASA} And all of
a sudden, I remembered.

272
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,916
[MIKASA] I'd seen it all before.

273
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
[MIKASA] Many, many times.
Since the day I was born.

274
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,958
[MIKASA] It'd been all
around me. Forever.

275
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,166
[MIKASA] But...

276
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,250
[MIKASA] I always
looked the other way.

277
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:54,750
[MIKASA] Yeah. The
world is a cruel place.

278
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,916
[MIKASA] And it's home.

279
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,333
[MIKASA] All of a sudden,
my body wasn't shaking.

280
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:15,958
[MIKASA] I was in total
control. Focused. Ready.

281
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,291
[MIKASA] All of a sudden,
I could do anything.

282
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,875
[MIKASA] "Fight."

283
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,041
[MIKASA] "Fight!"

284
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,750
[MIKASA] Fight!

285
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,041
[Mikasa screaming]

286
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,125
[ELITE] Stabbed through
the heart from behind.

287
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,500
Surely a couple of kids
couldn't've done this.

288
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,458
Damn it, son. I made it
clear I wanted you to wait

289
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,666
at the foot of the mountain.
Do you even understand

290
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,916
the magnitude of what
you've done here today?

291
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,416
Sorry, Dad. I'm not gonna
feel bad for what happened.

292
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,916
They were animals
disguised as humans

293
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,625
who needed to be put down.

294
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,000
Listen to yourself!

295
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,791
[EREN] By the time the
Military Police got here,

296
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,875
[EREN] they'd have been
long gone and you know it!

297
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,041
[EREN] We couldn't
afford to wait!

298
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,916
That's not what
I'm arguing about!

299
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,250
You threw caution to the wind

300
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,916
and survived by pure luck!

301
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,375
[GRISHA] You're strong, yes,

302
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,833
[GRISHA] but you are
too damn young to be

303
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,666
[GRISHA] so casual about
gambling with your life!

304
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,500
But, I-- I didn't know how
else I was supposed to save her.

305
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:35,458
Mikasa. Remember me?
We met a few times before

306
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,208
when you were just
a tiny little thing.

307
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:44,208
Yes, Dr. Jaeger. So, um--

308
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,916
Sorry, can you just
tell me how to get home?

309
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,791
[MIKASA] It's cold. I'm tired.

310
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,291
There's really nowhere
else for me to go.

311
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,750
[EREN] Don't worry.
You can keep it.

312
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,333
That ought to keep
you warm, right?

313
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,125
I think so.

314
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,916
Mikasa, how would you feel
about coming to live with us?

315
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,375
[MIKASA] What?

316
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,791
I can't even imagine
what you've been through.

317
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,958
[GRISHA] But I do know
you need your share of rest.

318
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,416
[EREN] What's the problem?

319
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,958
[EREN] Don't think
about it. Just come on.

320
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,791
We gotta get home.

321
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,125
Yeah. Okay.

322
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,208
[MIKASA] The world's
a cruel place.

323
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,708
[MIKASA] If you want to
live, you have to fight.

324
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,791
[IAN] That's it. We're done.

325
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,125
Now scale the wall.

326
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,166
I should help the
vanguard withdraw, sir.

327
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,833
Ackerman! Wait!

328
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:27,250
[MIKASA] It's a cruel world,
but I have a place in it.

329
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,958
[MIKASA] Eren. As long
as you're part of my life,

330
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,916
[MIKASA] I can fight
to the bitter end.

331
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:14,458
[NARRATOR] "It's a cruel world,
but I have a place in it."

332
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,583
[NARRATOR] Mikasa races
through hell to be beside
