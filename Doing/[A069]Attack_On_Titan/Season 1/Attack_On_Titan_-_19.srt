1
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,791
[LEVI] Blades drawn. Now.

2
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:27,166
[LEVI] It'll happen in the
blink of an eye. Be ready.

3
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,375
Go! Move it!

4
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,291
[GUNTHER] Holy shit!

5
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,666
How the hell are we supposed to
pull evasive maneuvers in here?

6
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,916
It's catchin' up!

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,708
Captain! Engage the ODM gear?

8
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,250
[PETRA] Captain!

9
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,458
[SOLDIER] Where you goin'?

10
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,500
[PETRA] Rear Reinforcements!

11
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,291
[grunts]

12
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,750
[screams]

13
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,625
[screams]

14
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,166
Captain! Your orders!

15
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,916
It's dangerous!
Let's take it out!

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,791
[ORUO] Tell us to engage, sir!

17
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,708
[GUNTHER] She's gaining on
us! Let's just take her out!

18
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,583
That's the whole reason
we're here, isn't it?

19
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,583
Right, sir? Captain!

20
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,041
[EREN] Your
orders, sir! Please!

21
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,125
Everyone cover
your ears. Now.

22
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,708
[ALL] Huh?

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:55,083
[high pitched ringing]

24
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:41,375
[high pitched ringing]

25
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,416
Was that an acoustic round?

26
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,625
Remind me, what is our mission?

27
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,083
Is it to simply act on impulse
in the heat of the moment?

28
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:53,000
[LEVI] Let me answer that
question for you. It's not.

29
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,625
This squad's mission is
to keep this brat alive,

30
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,958
whatever the cost.

31
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,958
Don't forget it.

32
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,416
[EREN] It's not
just to police me?

33
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,875
We keep pushing forward,
on horseback. Is that clear?

34
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,416
As a bell, sir!

35
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,791
But for how long? We
can't keep running forever!

36
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,541
She's right on
top of us as it is.

37
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,458
If we don't do something soon--

38
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,833
[EREN] No!

39
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,125
They keep coming!
They're all gonna die unless

40
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,791
we turn around
and do something!

41
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,958
Eyes front! Stop
lookin' behind us!

42
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,041
Seriously?

43
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,333
Keep pace with the group!

44
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,291
Maintain top speed
or we're all dead!

45
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,833
Eld, please! Help
them! If the Levi Squad

46
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,208
can't stop this thing, then
who can? Those men need us!

47
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,500
[EREN] Another one!

48
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,416
[EREN] Damn it,
he didn't have to die!

49
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,583
Come on,
there's still one left.

50
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,375
We can save him
before it's too late!

51
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,541
Do as you're told,
Eren! Eyes forward!

52
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,291
How can all of you just ignore
what's happening back there?

53
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,125
Are you tellin' me to
abandon my comrades? Is that it?

54
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,583
Damn it, yes!

55
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,000
Stop whining and do as
your captain tells you!

56
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,083
[EREN] Why are we
letting people die?

57
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,833
[EREN] If this is part
of some bigger picture,

58
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,916
[EREN] why can't
someone explain it to me?

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,041
"Ask not the reason why,
ask but to do and die!"

60
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,375
You'd understand
what that meant

61
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,875
if you weren't such
a useless greenhorn!

62
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,666
[ORUO] Now stifle it.
Behave like a soldier!

63
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,583
[EREN] No.

64
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,708
[EREN] I can do
this without them.

65
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,708
[EREN] I don't need
to rely on anyone else.

66
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,583
[EREN] I'm a
squad all to myself!

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
No, Eren! Stop!

68
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,458
You're only permitted
to assume Titan form

69
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,208
when your life's
in extreme peril!

70
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,041
That was the agreement!
You swore an oath!

71
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,416
[PETRA] Eren!

72
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,291
[LEVI] I wouldn't blame you.

73
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,083
Do as your
conscience dictates.

74
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:10,791
But Eren, listen.
You are not inherently evil.

75
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,208
You're ability to change
doesn't make you a monster.

76
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,041
That said, it could
be the other way around.

77
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,458
How're you supposed to
know where to draw the line?

78
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,125
Whether you lose control
or freely give it up.

79
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,541
Maybe it's the same.

80
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,208
And slaughter every
Titan that crosses my path!

81
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,083
[LEVI] Look, Eren. We don't
agree because our experience

82
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,958
[LEVI] brings us to
opposing views. That's life.

83
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,458
[LEVI] At the end of the
day, there's no reason

84
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,708
[LEVI] to go
against how you see it.

85
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:42,583
[LEVI] The choice is yours.
You can trust yourself.

86
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,000
[LEVI] Or you can trust
the people willing to

87
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,458
[LEVI] put their lives
on the line for you.

88
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,791
I don't know which way
is better. I never have.

89
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,708
Should I act on my own
instincts, or put myself

90
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,500
in the hands of my
comrades and trust them.

91
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,416
Either way,
there's no guarantee.

92
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,791
In the end, you
choose what you choose.

93
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,416
If afterwards, your regrets
are at a minimum, good for you.

94
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,666
[PETRA] Eren!

95
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,166
Trust us.

96
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,333
[LEVI] Good news. There
may be a way to stop you

97
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,250
[LEVI] without killing you.

98
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,333
[EREN] Sir?

99
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,875
[LEVI] In your Titan form.

100
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,333
We may have some
middle ground after all.

101
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,333
A fail-safe if you will.

102
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,958
The method I've come up with
will only leave you mutilated.

103
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,833
Well, at least in theory.
Depends on individual skill.

104
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,125
Essentially, we
cut the entire nape

105
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,666
[LEVI] from the body,
with you inside.

106
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,541
Your arms and legs'll
be severed halfway down

107
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,166
in the process,
but you'll survive.

108
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,291
[LEVI] As a matter of fact,
they'll probably just grow back,

109
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,166
[LEVI] lizard-style.
Creepy little bastard.

110
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,750
Hold on a sec.

111
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,458
I'm not really
sure how they do it.

112
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,750
I mean, they might but

113
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,250
maybe it's not worth
the risk that they won't.

114
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,041
Oh, I see. You're
only up for this

115
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,083
if there's no risk
involved whatsoever.

116
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,458
[EREN] No...

117
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,916
Then be prepared.
We're in the same boat.

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,458
If you go on a rampage you
could kill us. So we're even.

119
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,541
Yes, sir. Seems
perfectly fair to me.

120
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,791
[HANGE] Just to be clear,
I have the go-ahead, right?

121
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,166
We can't afford not to run
tests. So yes, you're good.

122
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,000
Just try to keep him from going
rogue right out of the gate.

123
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,166
[HANGE] Oh, not to
worry. I have a plan.

124
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,708
[HANGE] Eren. I know you're
still a mystery to yourself,

125
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,666
[HANGE] but we learn as we go.

126
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,958
[HANGE] Knowledge is always
worth the risk. I believe that.

127
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,875
[HANGE] You ready
down there, my dear?

128
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:06,958
[HANGE] When
we're good to begin,

129
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,458
[HANGE] I'll fire
off a smoke signal.

130
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,541
What happens after
that's entirely up to you.

131
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,458
Ready when you are, Commander!

132
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,916
If the boy loses control,
this well should hold him

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,541
'til he wears himself out.
If not, we'll go with

134
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,791
Levi's method. Perfect.

135
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,833
[EREN] Alright.

136
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:31,041
[EREN] It's been a while.
Since Trost, actually.

137
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,958
[EREN] I've got to
keep a hold of myself.

138
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,500
[EREN] The Levi Squad's
well within their jurisdiction

139
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,250
[EREN] to kill me
if I lose control.

140
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,083
[HANGE] Hmm.

141
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,791
I don't understand it.
Perhaps he missed the signal?

142
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,041
Perhaps. Or perhaps
we're just naive to

143
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,416
expect he can
turn it on and off.

144
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,000
[LEVI] Eren! Enough!
We're done for today.

145
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,166
Did something
go wrong down there?

146
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:15,416
I'm sorry. I don't
think I can do it now.

147
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,500
You're telling me the
bite wounds on your hands

148
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,750
show no sign of healing?

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,625
None, sir.

150
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,500
No offense, but you're not
much good to us in this form.

151
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:34,083
If you can't change, our plans
for Wall Maria go up in smoke.

152
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,041
Pull it together.
And yes, that is an order.

153
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,666
Yes, sir.

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,958
C'mon, don't lose heart,
kid. You'll get it.

155
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,541
Maybe, I don't know.

156
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,708
[ORUO] Well, that's one
hell of a way to learn

157
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,875
[ORUO] you're more
human than suspected.

158
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,500
Look at it this way, it's
a lot better to find out now

159
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,583
than in the field. Back
to the drawing board, huh?

160
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,958
He's right. No such
thing as being too careful

161
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,208
when so much is ridin' on you.

162
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:09,375
[EREN] How-- How can
they all be so damn calm?

163
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,125
[EREN] Are they
actually relieved

164
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,708
[EREN] I can't
turn into a Titan?

165
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,375
Is everything okay?

166
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,916
[EREN] Yeah.

167
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,916
[struggling]

168
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:38,625
[SOLDIER 1] What the--?

169
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,208
[SOLDIER 2] Titan steam?

170
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,416
What the hell's
going on over there?

171
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:53,583
[struggling]

172
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,000
Dammit why now?

173
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,666
[LEVI] Calm down.

174
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,875
I'm sorry, Captain.
I-- I don't know how I--!

175
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:06,041
The situation is
complicated. Now, calm down.

176
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,541
[HANGE] Please be
what I think it was.

177
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,375
[HANGE] Please be
what I think it was.

178
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:41,041
[Hange excited shouting]

179
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,166
[ELD] Eren! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

180
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,750
Sir, please.

181
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,833
No one gave you permission
to transform, did they?

182
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,041
I said calm down--

183
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,625
Answer the question,
Eren! What got into you?

184
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,750
Leave it. Explanations
can come later.

185
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,833
First thing's first.
You need to persuade us

186
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,541
you're not hostile like
your life depends on it!

187
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,541
Huh?

188
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,041
[GUNTHER] Prove
it or we kill you!

189
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,958
The burden of
proof is yours, kid!

190
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,416
So much as twitch an arm
and I'll lob your head off!

191
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,833
This is the first and
only warning you'll receive!

192
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,416
[ORUO] I can end
you in a heartbeat!

193
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,875
[ORUO] Do you
understand me, boy?

194
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,083
Oruo! How many times
do I have to say it--

195
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,125
Captain! I need you to
step away. You're too close!

196
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,625
Right now, I believe
you're the ones

197
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,625
who need to step away. Do it.

198
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,291
Why on earth--?

199
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,416
A gut feeling!

200
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,333
Eren better say something!

201
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,291
[EREN] I don't--
[ORUO] Don't try anything cute!

202
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,625
[GUNTHER] Prove
you're not hostile!

203
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,041
[ORUO] Now!
[EREN] Seriously, I don't--

204
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,958
[ELD] This is serious!
We will kill you!

205
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,458
[ORUO] I'll do it!
I swear to god!

206
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,000
[ELD] Are you with us or not?

207
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,833
[GUNTHER] Can you not hear me?
[ORUO] That's it! He's dead!

208
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,666
Be quiet! All of
you just be quiet!

209
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,166
Eren!

210
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,958
I wanna touch the arm!
I wanna touch the arm!

211
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,916
Pretty please
with sugar on top!

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,833
Let me touch
this glorious thing!

213
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,291
I don't think that's
such a good-- Wait, no!

214
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,041
[HANGE] Argh! Son of a bitch!

215
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,000
[HANGE] That mother is
hot when there's no skin!

216
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,125
[HANGE] This is the best
day in the history of science!

217
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,541
[MOBLIT] You're a maniac!
You hear me? A maniac!

218
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,208
Are you not burning
up? What's it like?

219
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,750
How is it connected
to your hand?

220
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,916
Oh you have to show me!
I really, really wanna see!

221
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,083
[EREN] Wait, yeah. I should
just be able to pull it out.

222
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,875
[EREN] Come on!

223
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,625
[struggling]

224
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,666
Are you ignoring me?
Don't try anything stupid!

225
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,875
[Eren stuggling]

226
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,041
[HANGE] No! What are you
doing? That's too soon!

227
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,625
I wanted to put
it under the knife!

228
00:14:53,875 --> 00:15:00,000
[heavy breathing]

229
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,708
Sorry, Captain.

230
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,583
So you feelin' okay or what?

231
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:10,333
[heavy breathing]

232
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:15,583
[EREN] Not... exactly... No...

233
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,708
[EREN] That was quite a
wake-up call, let me tell ya.

234
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,083
[EREN] 'Til their
blades were drawn,

235
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,416
[EREN] I had no idea
how little they trusted me.

236
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,041
And what did you expect?

237
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,416
A suspicious nature
was the top of my criteria.

238
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,916
[LEVI] Traditionally, you're
not considered a real Scout

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,458
[LEVI] 'til
you come back alive.

240
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,875
But out there, there's always
so little intel to go on.

241
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,000
So many uncertainties
and unknowns

242
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,750
it's a miracle any
of us come back alive.

243
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,041
[LEVI] You have
to be reactive, quick.

244
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,166
[LEVI] Hit the ground running
while anticipating the worst.

245
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,833
That doesn't make
them heartless, though.

246
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,958
They're not just a
bunch of mindless machines.

247
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,958
Whatever that might've
looked like out there today,

248
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,125
I can promise you that

249
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,166
every single one of
them was conflicted.

250
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,833
[MOBLIT] Captain Levi.
[LEVI] Hm?

251
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,875
[MOBLIT] Section Commander
Hange would like a word, sir.

252
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,666
[LEVI] Man. How long of a
shit were you taking, anyway?

253
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,666
[HANGE] Oh, long enough
to get the job done.

254
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,375
[HANGE] Thank you for asking.

255
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,541
Meeting the brass can
do a number on your bowels.

256
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,708
But enough about that.

257
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,458
[HANGE]
Feast your eyes on this.

258
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,625
[EREN] That's the spoon, right?

259
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,500
[HANGE] The very one.

260
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,000
Your spontaneous Titan
arm erupted into being

261
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,125
while holding it. Like so.

262
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,250
Resting between the
thumb and the index finger.

263
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,708
The world operates on chance,
so coincidences are expected.

264
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,458
But this begs something more.

265
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,666
This utensil wasn't warped
by the heat or by the pressure.

266
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,875
Any thoughts on the matter?

267
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,125
Uh... All I know is
that I went to pick it up.

268
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,875
When I did the arm
came out of nowhere.

269
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,000
[HANGE] Interesting.

270
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,625
This might explain why you
couldn't change in the well.

271
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,416
I'm certain of it.

272
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,250
[HANGE] Slaying Titans.

273
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,791
[HANGE] Blocking cannon fire.

274
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,041
[HANGE] Lifting big rocks.

275
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,833
[HANGE] In each instance
before assuming Titan form

276
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,166
[HANGE] seemingly at will, there
was a distinct goal in mind.

277
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,833
I believe it's
possible that self-harm

278
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,375
isn't the only catalyst
of transformation.

279
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,166
It appears as
though a clear objective

280
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,333
is a crucial
ingredient as well.

281
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,208
I think you might
be on to something.

282
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,583
This last time was a lot like

283
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,833
the time with the
cannon ball. But I--

284
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,750
[EREN] I transformed
into a Titan

285
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,791
[EREN] just to
pick up a damn spoon?

286
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,000
[EREN] That's insane.

287
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,291
So, uh. What I'm getting
out of this is what you pulled

288
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,583
wasn't something
you did on purpose?

289
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,333
No, sir.

290
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,750
[sigh]

291
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,958
[gasp]

292
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,750
What the--? What the
hell you think you're doing?

293
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,875
[GUNTHER] Ow.

294
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,750
'Kay, that hurts like a
son of a bitch. Damn, kid.

295
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,208
I'm impressed you
can sink your teeth in

296
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,541
that deep without shrieking.

297
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,291
We made a judgment
call today and it was wrong.

298
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,666
Consider this our
way of apologizing.

299
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,708
That is if you can find it
in your heart to forgive us.

300
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,083
Huh?

301
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,833
We have to make spur of
the moment decisions, okay?

302
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,416
Make the best call we
can with what we know.

303
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,541
It's our job to
keep you in check!

304
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,833
The fact is we were scared.

305
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,083
That's no excuse, I know.

306
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,208
You've every right to be upset.

307
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,750
But-- All that aside,

308
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,958
we're doomed if we
can't trust one another.

309
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,916
Just as you are
if you can't trust us.

310
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,166
[PETRA] Eren.

311
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,125
I'm asking you.

312
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,833
[PETRA] Trust us!

313
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:09,541
♪

314
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:13,541
[LEVI] Eren! C'mon!
Make up your damn mind!

315
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm with you!

316
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,291
[SOLDIER] No!

317
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,750
[EREN] Forgive me!

318
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,875
[GUNTHER] Target
is accelerating!

319
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,625
Just keep moving!
We'll outrun the bitch!

320
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,000
[EREN] Outrun it?
Are you kidding me?

321
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,416
[EREN] We keep riding with
our backs to her like this,

322
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,125
[EREN] we'll be crushed
before we know what hit us!

323
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,625
[EREN] No.
We're at death's door.

324
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,541
[EREN] We've seen our
comrades die left and right.

325
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,333
[EREN] And we're
still moving forward.

326
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,208
[EREN] They trust the
captain, and he trusts them.

327
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,250
[EREN] That's
what this is about.

328
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,833
[EREN] That's why they
can all keep moving.

329
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:22,416
[EREN] I-- I need
to be a part of it.

330
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:28,708
[EREN] I need to trust
them, like they trust me!

331
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,083
[gasps]

332
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,666
Fire!

333
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,125
Everyone hitch your
horses a bit further on.

334
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,041
Switch to ODM gear.

335
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,541
I have to break
away for a little while.

336
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,791
Eld's in charge
'til I get back.

337
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,000
[LEVI] Tuck Eren
somewhere out of sight,

338
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,666
[LEVI] away from
the Female Titan.

339
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,541
[LEVI] And see to my horse.

340
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,875
Wait, what?

341
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,666
[EREN] They're going to
take her alive? Seriously?

342
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,458
So what do you
think of us now, Eren?

343
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,166
We managed to
outsmart the damn thing!

344
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,166
Let this be a lesson
to you, greenhorn!

345
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,916
Don't ever
underestimate the Scouts!

346
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,708
[ORUO] Never again! Agreed?

347
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,458
Agreed!

348
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,291
She's not putting
up much of a fight.

349
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,958
That's no reason
to let our guard down.

350
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,833
[ERWIN] Good work
leading her here.

351
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,916
I'm more than
a little impressed.

352
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,541
We couldn't have
without the rear contingent

353
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,541
whose lives bought us
time. This belongs to them.

354
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,000
I don't intend
to ever forget that.

355
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,666
That so?

356
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,125
[LEVI] Yes.

357
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,875
Because of their sacrifices,

358
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:23,875
[LEVI] we can expose
whoever this really is.

359
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:24,875
Ten to one they're in there

360
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,250
pissing themselves
right about now.

361
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,833
[NARRATOR] Erwin
Smith's top-secret plan to

362
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,708
[NARRATOR] capture the
Female Titan has succeeded.

363
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,458
[NARRATOR] But as the
Scout Regiment attempts to

364
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,708
[NARRATOR] reveal
her true identity,

365
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:21,083
[NARRATOR] they find a
nasty shock waiting for them.
