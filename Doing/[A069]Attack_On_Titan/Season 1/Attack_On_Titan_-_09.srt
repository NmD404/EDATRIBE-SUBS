00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,750
So, you're
saying everyone who

174
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,791
isn't here now
didn't uh... you know.

175
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,375
Yeah.

176
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,500
Wait. What about Mikasa?

177
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,000
[CONNY] No, no. She's good.

178
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,333
[CONNY] She made it in after
us with the group Jean led.

179
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,583
Hey, Jean! Where
in the world's Mikasa?

180
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,625
[YMIR] She get hurt or what?

181
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,000
[CONNY] Hey. Talk to us.

182
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,416
[JEAN] I'd tell you if I could.

183
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,333
[JEAN] They slapped
us with a gag order.

184
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,250
[CONNY] Whoa.
You're joking, right?

185
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,791
[YMIR] That's nuts.

186
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,875
[JEAN] They're nuts if they
think people aren't gonna talk.

187
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,416
[JEAN] Word'll get out,
and when it does...

188
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,833
Well, that is, if we survive.

189
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,583
[HANNES] You gotta hand it
to the Engineering Corps for

190
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,875
[HANNES] puttin' the heap
of rancid Titan corpses

191
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,791
[HANNES]
to good use, I suppose.

192
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,458
[HANNES] Still just
a barricade, though.

193
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,333
[HANNES] We can't
get too comfortable.

194
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,750
Stay on your toes.

195
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,333
Whatever happens next,
it's bound to happen here.

196
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,916
This is the proverbial
line in the sand--

197
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,750
Hey, something wrong?

198
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,583
Sir. My apologies.
I completely agree.

199
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,708
I'm just a little
preoccupied about

200
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,458
my friends in the Vanguard.

201
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,416
There was a messenger
on the way to HQ

202
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
with this look on his face.

203
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:53,000
Kid. Difficult as it may be,
you've got to wrangle your mind

204
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,708
to stay focused on
what's here in front of us.

205
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,916
[ELITE] Is it true what they
say about you saving those

206
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,916
[ELITE] kids five
years ago, sir?

207
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,666
[ELITE] They're
cadets now, right?

208
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,083
[ELITE] Won't they be
at the Vanguard, too?

209
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,916
That's right.

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,375
I'm really sorry, sir.

211
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,500
Don't know why I felt
the need to bring it up.

212
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,125
They're good.

213
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,916
Some tough little bastards.

214
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,791
Believe me, they know
what it takes to stay alive.

215
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,500
One of 'em's just about the
best fighter I've ever seen.

216
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,166
The other's so stubborn
it can drive you crazy.

217
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,666
Loads of inner strength.

218
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,375
And their friend's
a certifiable genius.

219
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,791
They'll be fine.
Not a doubt in my mind.

220
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,875
[WOERMAN] Cadets Eren
Jaeger, Mikasa Akermann,

221
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,458
[WOERMAN] and Armin Arlelt!

222
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,875
[WOERMAN] The three
of you have jointly

223
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,833
[WOERMAN] committed
an act of high treason!

224
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:43,541
Whether or not a swift execution
is the result depends on you!

225
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,041
What?

226
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,000
[WOERMAN] Any attempt to move
from where you stand now,

227
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,500
[WOERMAN] anything I deem
the least bit suspicious,

228
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,375
[WOERMAN] will be met with
cannon fire. Do not test me.

229
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,125
[WOERMAN] Answer carefully.

230
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,500
[WOERMAN] Eren Jaeger.
What exactly are you?

231
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,583
[WOERMAN] Human? Or Titan?

232
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,000
[EREN] Wh-What is
that supposed to mean?

233
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,041
[EREN] Why are they all
glaring at me like that?

234
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,708
[EREN] It's like-- Like
they're looking at a monster.

235
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:16,750
[EREN] Oh god. Is
that what they think?

236
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,208
I'm sorry, sir!
I don't understand!

237
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,250
Son of a bitch
is playing innocent.

238
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,458
Answer me, damn you!

239
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,208
Evasion will get you nowhere!

240
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,291
[WOERMAN] Don't try to
stall with pretend ignorance!

241
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,541
[WOERMAN] You won't stand a
chance! You'll be blown to hell

242
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,333
[WOERMAN] before you can
assume your true form!

243
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,583
What true form?

244
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,083
Please! Scores
of us saw it happen!

245
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,458
[WOERMAN] You emerged from
the carcass of a fallen Titan

246
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,958
[WOERMAN] in full
view of your comrades!

247
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,875
[WOERMAN] A creature of unknown
origin, ability, or allegiance

248
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,916
[WOERMAN] has slipped through
and infiltrated Wall Rose,

249
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,875
[WOERMAN] and that
creature is you.

250
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,375
[WOERMAN] Under
the circumstances,

251
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,458
[WOERMAN] your being sanctioned
by His Majesty is neither

252
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,916
[WOERMAN] here nor there.
You are a risk I am

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,833
[WOERMAN] well within
my rights to eliminate!

254
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,541
I will not let
the situation stand!

255
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,625
[WOERMAN] Every moment I
squander mulling over your

256
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,833
[WOERMAN] supposed innocence
puts us all in further

257
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,250
[WOERMAN] jeopardy from attack
by the Armored Titan!

258
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,958
Hell! For all I'm aware,
you're a tactical diversion

259
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,750
precisely for
that purpose! I'm sorry.

260
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,583
Humanity's fate
hangs in the balance!

261
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,250
[WOERMAN] I cannot waste any
more time or manpower on you!

262
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,125
[WOERMAN] Do you understand?

263
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,416
[WOERMAN] My conscience will
not falter to watch you die!

264
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,875
Nor should it.

265
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,666
As soldiers, they all know
the price of their position.

266
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,166
If they're this
committed to defiance

267
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,208
under threat
of death, so be it.

268
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,875
They won't be persuaded.

269
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,458
And as you say, it's
just a waste of time.

270
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,250
Sir, please! This may
be our best chance!

271
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:40,125
[ELITE] We'll expend far less
artillery if he's in human form!

272
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,708
[MIKASA] Excuse me!

273
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:46,000
I wouldn't. Not while
I'm standing here.

274
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,666
[MIKASA] Unless anyone's feeling
up to the task, in which case,

275
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,458
well, I 'm happy to
demonstrate my own technique.

276
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:57,625
On you. And every last inch
of your traitorous flesh.

277
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,916
Sir. There's something
you should know.

278
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,125
She was assigned to the
elites fresh out of training.

279
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,166
Equal to a hundred
soldiers, easily.

280
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,791
[IAN] If we lost her,
it'd be quite the tragedy.

281
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,333
Okay. Somebody talk to me now.

282
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,833
The hell is all this?

283
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,916
Mikasa! You can't
take them all on!

284
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,666
Even if you took down a few,

285
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,833
there's nowhere
left for you to run!

286
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,250
Whoever comes at
Eren, deals with me.

287
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,833
I'll take on the entire
regiment if I have to.

288
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,250
I don't give a damn what
they try to throw at us.

289
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,791
[ARMIN] This isn't the only
way! They're just scared.

290
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,625
[ARMIN] They don't
understand what's happening!

291
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,416
[ARMIN] We need to calm
down and just talk it out!

292
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,791
[EREN] Am I the only one here
who doesn't think I'm a Titan?

293
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,333
[EREN] Damn it! Why can't
I remember how I got here?

294
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:51,666
[EREN] I'm too weak to stand up,
and if I say the wrong thing...

295
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,583
[EREN] Is this it for me?

296
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,625
[EREN] Killed by people.

297
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,833
[EREN] What was that he
said about me coming out of

298
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,541
[EREN] a Titan carcass
in front of everyone?

299
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,750
[EREN] Is he insane?

300
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,458
[EREN] Why is no
one making any sense?

301
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,791
[EREN] That was
all just a dream!

302
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,916
[EREN] Or...

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,541
[EREN] No. My sleeve. My arm.

304
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,000
[EREN] Am I really one of them?

305
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:24,666
[EREN] That's not possible.
It's just now I--

306
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,041
[WOERMAN] One more time!

307
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,875
Are you a human
being or a Titan?

308
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,666
[EREN] I-- I don't
know what to say.

309
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,333
[EREN] My life's not
the only one at stake.

310
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,041
[EREN] But, I mean I've
always been one of you.

311
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,166
I'm human!

312
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,750
So you say.

313
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,916
[WOERMAN] I'm
left with no choice.

314
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,833
[WOERMAN] Forgive me.

315
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,458
[WOERMAN] When push
comes to shove...

316
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,708
[WOERMAN] all
of us are monsters.

317
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,333
Armin! Head for the
wall! I've got Eren!

318
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,541
Wait, no--!

319
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,791
[GRISHA] Eren.

320
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,791
[GRISHA] Behave while I'm
gone and I'll let you in on

321
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,791
[GRISHA] what I've been
doing in the cellar.

322
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,333
[GRISHA] Listen to me.
It's vital that

323
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,125
[GRISHA] you keep this
key on you at all times.

324
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,041
[GRISHA] Whenever
you look at it,

325
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,375
[GRISHA] let this
thought flood over you:

326
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,208
[GRISHA] "I must
return to that cellar."

327
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,291
[GRISHA] I'm going to give
you a little something

328
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,250
[GRISHA] to make you
forget for the time being.

329
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,916
[GRISHA] I'm sorry.

330
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,666
I wish there was more
time to explain all this.

331
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,708
[GRISHA] When the time
comes though, know that you

332
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,500
[GRISHA] must reclaim Wall
Maria and head for the cellar.

333
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,500
[GRISHA] It won't be
pleasant, but in my heart,

334
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,750
[GRISHA] I know what
I'm doing is for the best.

335
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,083
When the ability confuses you,

336
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,000
let their memories
act as your guide.

337
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,291
[GRISHA] Eren!

338
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,875
[GRISHA] One day, the truth
will come out. I swear to you!

339
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,458
[GRISHA] The journey
will be a painful one.

340
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,166
[GRISHA] But it
is yours to make!

341
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,500

342
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,833

345
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,875
[WOERMAN] Did we get him?

346
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,250
Dear god.

347
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:35,833
[distant screaming]

348
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,958
[NARRATOR] Armin pleads
for the life of his friend,

349
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,750
[NARRATOR] desperate
to convince their comrades

350
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,125
[NARRATOR] Eren isn't
the monster he seems.

351
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:20,041
[NARRATOR] But however
eloquent, however passionate,

352
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,375
[NARRATOR] reason finds no
hold in minds wracked by fear.
