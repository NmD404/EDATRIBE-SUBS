1
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,041
[MP] When did you
last replace your shaft?

2
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,458
After the mop up, sir.
That was six days ago.

3
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,250
Right. She's clear.

4
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,583
Okay, you're good. Who's next?

5
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:10,291
I'm with squad 42.
Christa Lenz, sir!

6
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,416
[MP] Well, let's take a look.

7
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,333
[CADET] So now we can
actually get in trouble

8
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,083
for killing Titans?

9
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,916
Yeah, it's crazy, but they
were valuable test subjects.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,333
I know that. What I
don't understand is why

11
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,416
they're trying to find
the killer among the cadets.

12
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,291
[CADET] Right, we're
worn out enough as it is

13
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,833
[CADET] from cleaning
up the battlefield.

14
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,625
[CADET] Who'd have the energy?

15
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,416
Guess someone hated
lookin' at those Titans

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,875
even more than I did.

17
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,500
Mm. The sad thing is they
may've actually helped

18
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,958
the Titans more than anything.
All that knowledge lost,

19
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,166
and for what, someone's
personal revenge?

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,833
It just doesn't
make any sense.

21
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,041
Well, it might sound dumb,
but I'm glad they did it.

22
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,500
Before I'd actually seen
a Titan, I was convinced

23
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,500
I wanted to be a Scout
and take 'em all on.

24
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,750
[CONNY] Now I never wanna
lay eyes on one again.

25
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,541
[CONNY] And today, we have'ta
pick which Regiment to join.

26
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:11,250
[CONNY] Jean. Are you
really gonna do it?

27
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:23,500
[crying]

28
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,250
[JEAN] I guess regret's
the order of the day.

29
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,000
[JEAN] Right about now, we're
all wondering why the hell

30
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,666
[JEAN] we ever
put on this uniform.

31
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,958
[JEAN] Standing here,
watching our friends burn.

32
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,208
[JEAN] How could we possibly
think anything else?

33
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,916
Sorry, Marco.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,625
[JEAN] I don't even
know which of these bones

35
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,541
[JEAN] are yours, anymore.

36
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,208
[JEAN] If I hadn't
become a soldier,

37
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,583
[JEAN] I would've never had
to worry about who's next.

38
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,416
[EREN] So, you're tellin'
me it's better to just

39
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,250
[EREN] cut our
losses, is that it?

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,416
Let all the death and
destruction be meaningless?

41
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,791
[JEAN] We have to fight. I know
that's the right thing to do.

42
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:22,708
[JEAN] But I also know I'm not
a suicidal maniac like he is.

43
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,625
[thuds]

44
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,250
Huh?

45
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,333
Promise me you're not gonna
take this the wrong way.

46
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,875
[MARCO] But I don't
think you're a good leader

47
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,375
[MARCO] 'cause you're strong.

48
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,791
I think it's 'cause you
know what it is to be weak.

49
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,458
[MARCO] You're one of us.

50
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,500
You're scared out of your
mind, just like we all are.

51
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,333
It makes you
alert; sympathetic.

52
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,916
[JEAN] So, what
am I going to do now?

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,958
Hey guys. Question for you.

54
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,166
[YMIR AND CHRISTA] Huh?

55
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,250
So have you decided yet?

56
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,708
Which regiment
you're gonna join?

57
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:12,541
I've made my choice.
It'll be rough, but--

58
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:17,791
Dammit. I'm gonna
join the Scouts!

59
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:23,958
[Jean crying]

60
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:32,500
Ah, hell. Hey, Annie.
You think Jean meant it?

61
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,625
[CONNY] You think
he's serious about

62
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,125
[CONNY] signing
up with the Scouts?

63
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,916
Wait. Jean said that?

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,291
Who cares?

65
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,375
So you're sticking
with the MPs, huh?

66
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,333
I'm really startin' to think
I might go that way, too.

67
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,000
Tell me something.

68
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,666
If someone ordered you
to die, would you do it?

69
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,416
[CONNY] W-What? Of course not.

70
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,125
Well, then my advice
is do what's best for you.

71
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,291
[ANNIE] And what
about you, Armin?

72
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,208
[ARMIN] Oh, uh,
I think I might.

73
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,666
If the situation
truly called for it.

74
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,000
And I knew that my
sacrifice might save others.

75
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,583
[ARMIN] Not that I'd want to.

76
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,666
So, you've decided then.

77
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,916
[ARMIN] Mm. I've planned to
join the Scouts from the start.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,333
[CONNY] Come on.
Not you too, Armin?

79
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,708
[ANNIE] I'm impressed.
For a mouse, you've got guts;

80
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,083
[ANNIE] I'll give you that.

81
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,375
Uh. Thanks, I guess.

82
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,333
[ARMIN] You know,
I'm beginning to suspect

83
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,916
[ARMIN] you care
more than you let on.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,416
Huh?

85
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,166
[ARMIN] It's just, the way
you're trying to discourage us

86
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,875
[ARMIN] from the Scouts,
you're looking out for us.

87
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,750
Is that why you're
joining the MPs?

88
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,541
I bet you think you can
do some good there too, huh?

89
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,041
No, not really.

90
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,458
I just want to live.

91
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,833
The only person I'm
looking out for is myself.

92
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,500
[GUNTHER] After that whole
inspection, they didn't turn up

93
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,875
one person who used their
ODM gear without permission.

94
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,625
So who could'a done it?

95
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,500
Beats me. And right now,
I'm more concerned with

96
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,291
the recruitment
drive tonight.

97
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,166
How many cadets are
crazy enough to join

98
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,125
the regiment with
the highest casualties?

99
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,625
Hey, Eren! You
know if anyone in

100
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,916
[GUNTHER] your class is
thinking about joining us?

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,541
Yeah, there're a few.

102
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,125
Or, at least, there were.

103
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,041
I'm really not so sure now.

104
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,958
[GUNTHER] Fall in!

105
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,166
[LEVI] Make ready, people!
We're going on patrol.

106
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,375
[BOTH] Yes, sir!

107
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,750
Good morning, captain!
Reporting for duty!

108
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,083
[LEVI] Eren.
You will stay within

109
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,958
[LEVI] ten meters
of me at all times.

110
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,291
The only reason that you're
out of your cell is because

111
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,541
I'm keeping an eye
on you. Understood?

112
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,750
Yes, sir!

113
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,333
[LEVI] Let's ride!

114
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,958
[LEVI] Hyah!

115
00:07:49,041 --> 00:08:03,166
♪

116
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:16,208
[nervous chatter]

117
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,916
[ARMIN] Jean! You're
really set on the Scouts?

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,291
Yeah.

119
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,750
Whoa, are you serious? I
mean. Aren't you terrified?

120
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,333
Huh? Of course I'm scared,
I'm not an idiot here.

121
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,000
[CONNY] Uh. Then why are you--?

122
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,875
[JEAN] Because I am
scared of the Titans.

123
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,666
[JEAN] And I want to
do somethin' about it.

124
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,875
Huh?

125
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,958
[JEAN] But listen, I
understand that joining

126
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:42,166
the Scouts isn't for everybody.
I won't guilt trip you.

127
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,833
Unlike a certain
suicidal maniac.

128
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,916
Eren, huh?

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,125
Guess he's already been a Scout
for a while now, hasn't he?

130
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,416
[SOLDIER] Cadets! Fall in!
Head over to the platform!

131
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Time to make your
choice! Move it!

132
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,791
At the end of the day, there's
nothing that anyone could

133
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,750
say to persuade you
into risking your life.

134
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,750
[JEAN] Same goes for me.

135
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,958
So believe me when I say
this decision is all mine.

136
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,458
[ERWIN] Good evening.

137
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,333
[ERWIN] I am Erwin Smith,
Commander of the Survey Corp,

138
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,958
[ERWIN] also known
as the Scout Regiment.

139
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,583
[ERWIN] Today, you will
choose your regiment.

140
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,291
Let's cut to the chase
here. The Scouts need you.

141
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,916
We need all the
warm bodies we can get.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,458
[ERWIN] After the recent Titan
attack, you now know first-hand

143
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,458
[ERWIN] the horrors of
which they are capable.

144
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,375
[ERWIN] As well as the
limits of your own skill.

145
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,750
[ERWIN] However...!

146
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,541
This battle's
aftermath gave humanity

147
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,083
a new chance for victory.

148
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,291
I refer to Eren Jaeger.

149
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,541
[ERWIN] After selflessly
risking life and limb,

150
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,250
[ERWIN] he has proven,
beyond a doubt,

151
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,000
[ERWIN] his unwavering
loyalty to our cause.

152
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,500
Hope lives in him.

153
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,083
Eren didn't just help to
deter the Titan invasion.

154
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,291
He's offered us a means to

155
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,291
discern the truth
of their origin!

156
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:11,000
[various chattering]

157
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,541
[ERWIN] Intel suggests that
the cellar of Jaeger's home

158
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,541
[ERWIN] in Shiganshina
holds a vital secret

159
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,708
[ERWIN] regarding our enemy.

160
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,000
[ERWIN] We will form an
expedition to find this secret.

161
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,416
[ERWIN] Find it.
And use it to break free

162
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,541
[ERWIN] from the Titans'
tyrannical hundred-year reign

163
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,291
once and for all!

164
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,041
[gasping]

165
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,583
The cellar, huh?

166
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,000
[CADET 1] Things have
progressed this far?

167
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,625
[CADET 2] If we can figure
out what makes 'em tick,

168
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,666
[CADET 2] we can hit
'em where it hurts!

169
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,750
[ARMIN] I know the Scouts

170
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,583
[ARMIN] but going public
with this is out of line!

171
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,833
[ARMIN] Maybe it's a
ploy. A covert strategy?

172
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,500
[ARMIN] Question is
if he's baited the hook,

173
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,958
[ARMIN] who does
he intend to catch?

174
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,500
[ERWIN] Before we can
reach the aforementioned

175
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,958
[ERWIN] cellar in Shiganshina,

176
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,291
[ERWIN] another problem
must be dealt with.

177
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,708
We must first
retake Wall Maria.

178
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,208
Of course, this is much
easier said than done.

179
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,833
[ERWIN] And now
that the gate at Trost

180
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,458
[ERWIN] has been
rendered inaccessible,

181
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,291
[ERWIN] we'll be forced
to stage future operations

182
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,083
[ERWIN] from the Calanath
District, further east.

183
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,708
Thus, the battalion route
we've spent the last four years

184
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,541
[ERWIN] establishing is now
completely useless to us.

185
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,625
[ERWIN] Over the course
of those four years,

186
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,916
[ERWIN] we've incurred
losses in excess of 60%.

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,416
[ERWIN] 60% in four years.

188
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,625
[ERWIN] That's a
horrifying figure.

189
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,250
[ERWIN] One month from now,

190
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,708
we will conduct a recon
mission outside the walls.

191
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,166
Recruits from
among your ranks

192
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,041
will be expected
to take part.

193
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,208
[ERWIN] I estimate a
third of them will die.

194
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,666
[ERWIN] After four years,
most will be dead.

195
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,291
[ERWIN] But those who
endure will be amongst

196

capable soldiers alive.

197
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,625
Now having heard this
dismal state of affairs,

Can you give your heart?

201

[ERWIN] Can you give
everything for humanity?

00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,333
Apparently it's all true.

339
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,541
When I was a Titan I--
I tried to kill Mikasa.

340
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,208
"Apparently?" As in
you don't remember

341
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,500
whether you did or not?

342
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,166
So basically, you
can transform into a

343
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,583
14-meter tall monster
at will, but when you do,

344
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,875
[JEAN] you don't actually
have full control over it?

345
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,541
Not yet. But that's right.

346
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,333
Do you hear that everyone?
What a fine situation this is.

347
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:31,166
Our lives and the fate of all
mankind rest on his shoulders.

348
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,583
[JEAN] I'm guessin' we'll
probably all end up like Marco,

349
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,708
[JEAN] dead well before
Eren even knows it.

350
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,416
Stop it! What's the point
in chastising Eren now?

351
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,750
Just give it a rest.

352
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:45,416
[JEAN] Listen, Mikasa. Unlike
you, most of the rest of us

353
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,375
aren't willing to
just throw our lives away

354
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,291
for him on a whim.

355
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,416
[JEAN] We need a
reason. The truth.

356
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,583
We want to know what we're
laying our lives down for.

357
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,250
[JEAN] Otherwise,
we might hesitate

358
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,625
[JEAN] when
the time is at hand.

359
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,250
[JEAN] What we want is
a guarantee from Eren.

360
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,708
[JEAN] Show us what you're
worth. Prove it to us.

361
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,625
[JEAN] We're asking
you to make us believe

362
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,958
[JEAN] that you're
worth dying for.

363
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,375
[JEAN] You think
you can do that?

364
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:22,000
If you can, then we're
with you. All the way!

365
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,750
[EREN] Right.

366
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,666
[GARRISON] Commander.
The time approaches.

367
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,083
[GARRISON] Titans in the
vicinity have been lured away!

368
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,791
[GARRISON] Gate opens
in thirty seconds!

369
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,916
Awesome, it's the Scouts!

370
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,416
See that symbol? They call
it the Wings of Freedom!

371
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
[GIRL] So cool!

372
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,666
[DARIUS] This is it! The
day has come for humanity

373
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,875
to take another step forward!

374
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,291
[DARIUS] Now let's
show those Titans

375
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,458
[DARIUS] exactly
what we're made of!

376
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,458
[cheering]

377
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,250
[GARRISON] Open the gate!

378
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,458
[ERWIN] Forward!

379
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:31,250
[ERWIN] It's officially begun.
The 57th Recon Mission!

380
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,666
Scouts, move out!

381
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,083
[NARRATOR] The Scout
Regiment takes up its

382
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,750
[NARRATOR] long-range
scouting formation,

383
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,166
[NARRATOR] and begins to
make progress beyond the wall.

384
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,750
[NARRATOR] Their efforts,
however, come to an abrupt halt.

385
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,666
[NARRATOR] A new
foe presents itself.

386
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,583
[NARRATOR] An enigmatic
Titan displaying intelligence.
