173
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,375
I'll kill them all.

174
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,291
Every last one.

175
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,000
Eren.

176
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,083
[NARRATOR] In terrified haste,
The Central Government

177
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,791
[NARRATOR] declared the
Outlier Districts a lost cause

178
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,875
[NARRATOR] and decreed
all mankind retreat

179
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,750
[NARRATOR] behind Wall Rose.
Estimates held that nearly

180
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,791
[NARRATOR] ten-thousand
lives were lost

181
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,791
[NARRATOR] to the
Titan offensive.

182
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:20,875
Eren. Carla. Mikasa.
Please be alive!

183
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:28,583
[GRISHA] Eren! Stay
with me, boy! Wake up!

184
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,208
[EREN] Stop it!
Please, you're scaring me!

185
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,000
[EREN] I don't understand
what you're trying to do!

186
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,958
[GRISHA] You don't have to!
Just give me your arm!

187
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,416
[EREN] No! You're insane!

188
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
[EREN] Mom's death pushed
you off the deep end!

189
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,875
[GRISHA] Shut up!

190
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,083
[EREN] Get off! Let me go!

191
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,333
Damn you, this
is the only way!

192
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,375
[EREN] You're not
making any sense!

193
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,541
[GRISHA] You cannot
forget the key!

194
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,333
[GRISHA] Whatever you
do, you must reach it!

195
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,291
[GRISHA] It's the
way to the Truth!

196
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,125
[GRISHA] One day
you'll understand!

197
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:07,083
[bells ringing]

198
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:11,166
Hey. It's okay.
You were just dreaming.

199
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,541
Dad was-- It felt so real.

200
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,875
Nightmare. Shake it off.

201
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,875
Yeah.

202
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,708
[MIKASA] Come on.

203
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,916
They're handing out food
rations near the warehouse.

204
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,083
[MIKASA] I think this
used to be where they

205
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,125
[MIKASA] stored
all the dry goods.

206
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,791
[MIKASA] Now it's where
they corral the refugees.

207
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,416
[gasp]

208
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:51,541
[chattering]

209
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,083
[COMMONER] I don't
think so, friend!

210
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,500
[ANOTHER COMMONER]
Give me a break!

211
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,916
All I've had for two
days is a moldy bit of crust!

212
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,500
Not exactly a
dignified existence.

213
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,625
[ARMIN] Hey guys!

214
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,500
[EREN] Armin.

215
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,291
Glad I caught you. Here.
Grandpa scrounged a little extra

216
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,625
by telling the
powers-that-be he had kids.

217
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,125
That was nice of him.

218
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,375
Tch!

219
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,958
What's his deal?

220
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,708
Just ignore it.
There's a shortage.

221
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,791
Poor man's probably hungry.

222
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,208
By the way,
I'd make that last.

223
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,000
[ARMIN] They were
already dealing with famine

224
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,583
[ARMIN] before we
got here, so it's

225
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,375
[ARMIN] an ugly situation.
That, and this far in

226
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,041
[ARMIN] there's a
greater disparity between

227
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,958
[ARMIN] the haves
and the have-nots.

228
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,083
Nothin' more gratifyin' than

229
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,333
seein' your rations
go to animals.

230
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,708
Guess we gotta beef
up the herd, though.

231
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,875
Eat up, the Titans like a
little meat on their bones!

232
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,875
Eren, wait!

233
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,166
Oughta keep you in cages.

234
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,458
Shove you out to the
frontlines as a buffer.

235
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:01,833
Oww! Damn it! You picked
the wrong man, asshole!

236
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,750
Spineless cowards! All of you!

237
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,375
You don't-- You don't
know what it's like!

238
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,541
Huh?

239
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,041
You seen one? You
seen what they can do?

240
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,833
You little piece o'--

241
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,166
He's sorry! He didn't
mean it; he's just hungry.

242
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,208
We all get that way; speak our
minds out of turn sometimes?

243
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,291
Forgive him. I beg you.

244
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,208
Yeah, well. Keep in
mind who's givin' up

245
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,208
their share so you can eat.

246
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,208
In case you hadn't
noticed, we're all hungry.

247
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,250
[ELITE] Tell your buddy a little
gratitude goes a long way.

248
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,833
Sure!

249
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:46,583
Bastard. I'm not about to
show gratitude to a coward!

250
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,041
[EREN] I can't do this.
I'm going back to Wall Maria.

251
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,166
[EREN] The Titans have to pay
for what they've done to us.

252
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,500
Hey, now. You're not serious;
that's your stomach talking.

253
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,875
No, it's not!

254
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,416
Wake up! The guys standing
between us and them

255
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,333
are just a bunch of talk!

256
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,041
To hell with all of 'em!
Here. I'm going back!

257
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,083
Yeah? What're you
tying to do, starve?

258
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,083
When are you gonna
get sick of their charity?

259
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,541
Too much is handed to us!

260
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,458
We have to stand
on our own two feet!

261
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,666
To do what? Get
killed by a Titan?

262
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,125
I know I used
to think our future

263
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,916
was beyond the walls. But
it's like you told that man.

264
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,750
I'd never seen what
they could do to us!

265
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,083
So that's it? This
is just the way life is?

266
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,708
Run away and take
what we're given?

267
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,083
Look at us! What
choice do we have here?

268
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,916
We can damn-well leave!
If you wanna scrape by on

269
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,875

that's your thing,

[MIKASA] Have you looked

[MIKASA] All of
us are parasites.

00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,166
[MIKASA] We couldn't run from
certain death without help.

275
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,666
[MIKASA] Tell me differently.

276
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,416
[MIKASA] Don't take your
shortcomings out on him.

277
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,625
[MIKASA] For god's sake, we
can't even find food on our own.

278
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,250
[MIKASA] We're parasites.
We're cowards.

279
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,291
[MIKASA] Titans are at the
top of the food chain. Period.

280
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,291
Pride be damned; we
do what we must to live.

Your mom didn't
ask us to be brave.

Mikasa!

283
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,125
Eat it. She asked
us to stay alive.
