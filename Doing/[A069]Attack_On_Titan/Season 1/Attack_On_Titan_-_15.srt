1
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,208
[EREN] You-- You're all cowards!

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:24,708
Just shut up! And put
all your faith in me!

3
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,250
[LEVI] You don't need
a good "talking to."

4
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,500
[LEVI] What you're in need of,
boy, is to be taught a lesson.

5
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,375
Hm. Then I have made my choice.

6
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,708
[NARRATOR] And so it
was that Eren became a ward

7
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,791
[NARRATOR] of the Scout
Regiment, and key to

8
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,666
[NARRATOR] their planned
mission beyond the wall.

9
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:35,375
♪

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,250
[MAN] An architectural
marvel, don't you agree?

11
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,166
[MAN] A proper royal
residence once upon a time;

12
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,750
[MAN] and more recently,
our former headquarters.

13
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,166
Fancy, yes. But
absurdly impractical once

14
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,958
the Scouts got
down to business.

15
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,583
Much, much too far removed
from either river or wall.

16
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,791
[ORUO] This was the early
days for us, you understand.

17
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,750
[ORUO] Hopes soared high.
Now, this opulent bauble is

18
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,708
[ORUO] a little more
than a holding cell.

19
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,833
[ORUO] The place where
we store our newest toy.

20
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,958
Do not be deceived, greenhorn.

21
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,166
Excuse me?

22
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,333
Don't be expecting
the royal treatment.

23
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,583
Whether you're Titan or human,
don't imagine for a second

24
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,250
we all share the good
Captain's enthusi--

25
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,583
[Oruo screaming in pain]

26
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,875
[WOMAN] That's
what you get for

27
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,083
[WOMAN] flapping your
jowls on horseback.

28
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,083
[ORUO] The rookie
needed to know his place.

29
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,416
[ORUO] First
impressions are important.

30
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,750
[WOMAN] Well you certainly
made an impression on him.

31
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,166
[WOMAN] No question there.

32
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,000
[ORUO] Indeed so. Our exchange
went exactly as planned.

33
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,833
What, um...
What happened to you?

34
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,375
You never used
to talk like this.

35
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,833
I mean. It's really
none of my business,

36
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,916
but if you're trying
to act like the Captain,

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,708
it's kind of embarrassing.

38
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,250
You and Levi
couldn't be less alike

39
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,291
if you'd been born
separate species.

40
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,791
If you intend to hound
me like a wife, Petra, dear,

41
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,125
there's rather more of me
you need to be acquainted with

42
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,208
before laying claim
to the privilege.

43
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,916
[PETRA] Ha. You wish.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,291
[PETRA] I'd tell you
to bite your tongue,

45
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,833
[PETRA] but you've
got that covered.

46
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,750
[PETRA] Next time
I hope you bleed out.

47
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,208
[ORUO] Oh-ho-ho!

48
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,250
[ORUO] Methinks the
lady doth protest too much.

49
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,291
[EREN] So here they are.

50
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,916
[EREN] The Scouts'
Special Operations Squad.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,708
[EREN] The "Levi Squad."

52
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,666
You disgusting swineherd!

53
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,791
[EREN] Petra Rall. Ten
Titan-kills to her credit;

54
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,791
[EREN] forty-eight kill-assists.

55
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:34,041
[EREN] Oruo Bozad. Thirty-nine
kills; nine assists.

56
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,208
[EREN] Elite as they come.

57
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,791
[EREN] Eld Gin. Fourteen
kills; thirty-two assists.

58
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:48,750
[EREN] Gunther Schultz.
Seven kills; forty assists.

59
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,083
[EREN] Every one of these
Scouts was handpicked by

60
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,958
[EREN] Captain Levi for
accomplishments in the field.

61
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,458
[EREN] That, and...
They're my executioners.

62
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,125
[EREN] The ones who'll
end me if I lose it.

63
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,583
[GUNTHER] Look at these weeds.

64
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,416
[GUNTHER] This
place's gone to hell.

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,875
[ELD] It's been
abandoned for years.

66
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,041
[ELD] Bet the
inside's are shambles.

67
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,958
[LEVI] In which case we
have a problem, don't we?

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,541
Best grab a broom
and get to work.

69
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,250
I'm done with
the upstairs, sir.

70
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,458
If, uh-- If I
may ask, Captain,

71
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,541
where will I be
expected to sleep?

72
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,625
Your sleeping quarters
are in the cellar.

73
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,958
The cellar? But, sir, again?

74
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,666
Our safest option.

75
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,000
Your abilities are far
from being under control.

76
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,166
You might go
Titan in your sleep.

77
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,916
One of the conditions
of my having you

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,708
in custody at all
is that I keep you under

79
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,958
[LEVI] strict security
morning, noon, and night.

80
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,291
[LEVI] While we're in dreamland,
you're in restraints.

81
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,791
[LEVI] That's the rule.

82
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,500
I'll check your work.

83
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,791
Take over here.
I want it spotless.

84
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,250
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, Eren. Try not
to look so discouraged.

86
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,208
[PETRA] Sorry. I hope you
don't mind me calling you Eren.

87
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,166
[PETRA] I notice the
Captain does and, well,

88
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,041
[PETRA] he pretty much sets
the tone for the rest of us.

89
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,875
Whatever. It's just
that I, uh... well...

90
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,000
Did I really look discouraged,
or were you saying that?

91
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,875
[PETRA] Everyone
reacts that way.

92
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,000
Up close and personal,
Captain Levi doesn't seem

93
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,416
much like the hero
he's cracked up to be.

94
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,875
For one thing
he's a lot shorter.

95
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,875
Bit on the
temperamental side, too.

96
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:40,083
Not exactly imbued with what
you'd call the social graces.

97
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,416
It's not that. I'm more
put off by the seriousness.

98
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,958
He's so dead earnest about
following the higher-ups' rules.

99
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,750
[PETRA] Let me guess.
You think strength means

100
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,208
[PETRA] living by your own
rules, flouting everyone else's?

101
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:56,541
Well, he didn't strike me
as the type to take orders.

102
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,208
Time was he would've lived
up to your expectations.

103
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,500
That's what I understand anyway.
I don't have the details.

104
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,250
[PETRA] Story goes
he was quite the rogue

105
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,833
[PETRA] before
joining the Scouts.

106
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,625
[PETRA] A high roller in
the Capital's black market.

107
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,333
How the hell
did he-- I mean...

108
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,500
No clue. Folks talk,
but who knows what

109
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,166
really brought him here, right?

110
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,333
The most popular
version involves Erwin.

111
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,166
They say he dragged him to the
Scouts kicking and screaming.

112
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,291
The Commander?

113
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,791
What's going on?

114
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,500
Sir!

115
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,125
Your cleaning is lamentable.

116
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,041
Back upstairs. Now.

117
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,000
[MICHE] We're thirty days out
from an expedition to set up

118
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,291
[MICHE] a logistics
base beyond the wall.

119
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,750
And now you're saying
we'll have a crop of

120
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,125
green recruits
along for the ride?

121
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,416
[ERWIN] Assuming
any sign up, yes.

122
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,333
Not to be a nay-sayer, but
doesn't that seem rash to you?

123
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,583
Honestly, what are their odds?

124
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,333
Our custody of
Eren is conditional

125
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,125
on the results
of this mission.

126
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,875
Right now the first
order of business is

127
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,166
persuading the brass
we have him under control;

128
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,250
[ERWIN] that's he's
an asset, not a threat.

129
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,250
[ERWIN] The last thing we
want is for the Military Police

130
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,541
[ERWIN] to throw in their
lot. Or someone else.

131
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,791
And you don't wanna give me
a straight answer. Is that it?

132
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,250
Your nose is as sharp
as ever, huh? Not bad.

133
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,500
[sniff]

134
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,458
Yeah, well. Not as sharp
as yours on a good day.

135
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,750
You'll have the
facts soon enough.

136
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,208
[ELD] It's safe to
assume our standing orders

137
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,833
[ELD] will stretch
into next week.

138
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,791
[ELD] But word through the
grapevine is we're gearing up

139
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,416
[ELD] for a big mission
a month from now.

140
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,541
One where a bunch of
wet-behind-the-ears graduates

141
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,875
are slated to
be our main backup.

142
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,583
[GUNTHER] That can't be right.
Why do something like that?

143
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,041
The cadets have
been through enough

144
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,333
with the last Titan attack.

145
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,875
Why subject them to
that kind of danger again?

146
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,208
You have to wonder
how many of those

147
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,208
snivel-drop runts
peed themselves.

148
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,458
Surely this can't be the case.

149
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,666
[LEVI] Mission planning
isn't my responsibility.

150
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,833
But, it is Erwin's.

151
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,875
And you can bet the man's
obsessed over every angle.

152
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,125
That's the truth.

153
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,958
Especially given how
unique the situation is.

154
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,458
Consider how many people died
on the path to taking back

155
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:18,125
Wall Maria, then hope comes
in a form no one expected.

156
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,791
One that we're not even
entirely sure how to deal with.

157
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,125
Most of us still
find it hard to believe.

158
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,458
So how does it work?

159
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:37,000
This whole changing
into a Titan trick. Really?

160
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,458
Wish I could tell you, but the
fact is my memory's not clear.

161
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,125
Guess it's kinda
like being in a trance.

162
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,541
I do know the
trigger seems to be

163
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,541
hurting myself in some
way. Like biting my hand.

164
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:53,166
[EREN] Wait. Why do I
know that, but nothing else?

165
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,083
You're not going to
get anything out of him.

166
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,375
Apart from what the scribblers
have laid out in the reports.

167
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,916
[LEVI] Huh. Not that you-know-
who won't have a go at it.

168
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,333
[LEVI] You'll be lucky
to come out of it alive

169
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,458
[LEVI] if that
one lays into you.

170
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,291
[LEVI] 'Course it's
only a matter of time.

171
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,625
[EREN] Who're
you talking about?

172
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,375
[banging]
[HANGE] Oww!

173
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,875
I'm so sorry. Good
evening, Team Levi!

174
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,625
[HANGE] How is castle
life treating everyone?

175
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,083
You're too early.

176
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,583
[HANGE] Am I? S'pose
I couldn't help myself.

177
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,291
Section Commander Hange?

178
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,166
[HANGE] Hello, Eren.

179
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,208
In the event you haven't
pieced it together yet,

180
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,583
it's my job to spearhead the

181
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,583
Scout Regiment's
research efforts.

182
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,000
Essentially, I poke and prod
our captive Titan specimens.

183
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,375
I'd very much like your help.

184
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,541
My help? In what way?

185
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,125
Like, what
would I have to do?

186
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,583
[HANGE] Join me, of course!

187
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:50,000
On a quest of
scientific discovery!

188
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, uh... I'm happy to help,

189
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,708
except I'm afraid
it's not up to me.

190
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,583
[EREN] I'm under close
restrictions by order of

191
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,791
[EREN] the higher ups, you see.

192
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,666
Levi! What's on the
docket for him tomorrow?

193
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,166
Clearing out all the weeds.

194
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,791
Excellent, then! It's cinched!

195
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,916
Young man, tomorrow
will be grand.

196
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,208
Uh. 'Kay... But, uh...

197
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,958
Just so I'm clear, what
exactly will I be doing?

198
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,541
[HANGE] Hm?

199
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,791
Are you running
experiments or something?

200
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,833
Idiot. Shut up.

201
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,791
Ah. I knew it.

202
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,416
You possess a singularly
curious mind, don't you?

203
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,166
[HANGE] Well, my inquisitive
friend, if you insist.

204
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,875
[HANGE] Why not lay
it all on the table?

205
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,500
[HANGE] I intend to
get better acquainted

206
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,541
with the Titans we
lucked upon in Trost.

207
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,083
[HANGE] As a scientist,
naturally I started with

208
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,625
[HANGE] the standard
battery of tests

209
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,041
we conduct on
all such captures.

210
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,666
Hello, beautiful.

211
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,750
[HANGE] First was an
attempt at communication.

212
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,416
How're we feeling?

213
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,083
[HANGE] Do you have
a name? Are you in pain?

214
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,875
Section commander!
You're too close!

215
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,875
Hi there! Lovely
weather, don't you think?

216
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,208
Are you hungry?

217
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,708
[HANGE] Whoa! That was close!

218
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,708
[MALE SCOUT] That's what
I've been trying to tell you!

219
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,875
[HANGE] Sadly, my findings
were consistent with

220
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,666
[HANGE] all other
past attempts.

221
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,500
[HANGE] No communication
with them seemed possible.

222
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,625
[HANGE] That said, my time
spent in intimate proximity to

223
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,708
[HANGE] these creatures
did indeed help me cope with

224
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,041
[HANGE] the tediousness
of day-to-day tasks.

225
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,416
Once upon a time,
many centuries ago now,

226
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,125
there lived a vicious
tribe of cannibals.

227
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,166
[HANGE] You may think
I'm speaking of your kind,

228
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,375
[HANGE] but in fact,
these cannibals were human.

229
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,666
[HANGE] They would maraud unwary
travelers near their cave.

230
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,875
Their ruthless palate did
not discriminate between

231
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,458
merchant and clergymen;
highborn or low.

232
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,625
Valuables were taken,
flesh feasted upon.

233
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,166
We gotta go
through this again?

234
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,166
Her naming scheme is so weird.

235
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,041
Yeah. What'd she end
up going with last time?

236
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,250
It was Chikatilo and Albert.

237
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,583
[HANGE] In the end, these
cannibals subsisted on

238
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,750
human meat for twenty-five
years, give or take.

239
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,875
Historians suspect
they killed somewhere around

240
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,083
five hundred people
during that time.

241
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,500
That's probably
more victims than

242
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,708
the two of you have
gorged on, combined.

243
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,083
[HANGE] To their
credit, though,

244
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,750
[HANGE] they perfected
the art of preparing flesh.

245
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,541
[HANGE] Steaks cut
from hind-quarter meat.

246
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,708
[HANGE] Leg meat
diced and added to stew.

247
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,833
[HANGE] Belly fat ground
into patties and fried.

248
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,541
[HNAGE] Sausages made from blood
clots and intestinal lining.

249
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,708
In fact. One might even suggest

250
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,000
they furthered
the culinary arts.

251
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,791
In that respect they
were distinct from you.

252
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,250
[HANGE] Alas, this tribe
of gourmandizing cannibals

253
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,333
[HANGE] were caught and
executed by the providence

254
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,958
[HANGE] of a single mistake.

255
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,166
In that respect you
aren't so dissimilar.

256
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,791
You both underestimated
your quarry's resourcefulness

257
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,500
and wound up captured.
Victims of your own appetite.

258
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,291
[HANGE] In honor of the cannibal
tribe's notorious leader,

259
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,333
[HANGE] I'm going to christen
you beauties accordingly.

260
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,208
[HANGE] You'll be "Sawney."

261
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,833
[HANGE] You are "Beane."

262
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,875
No need to fret, though.
I'm not going to publicly

263
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,916
disembowel you or
burn you at the stake.

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,625
[HANGE] Pleasure to meet you,
Sawney. Likewise, Beane.

265
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,791
Let's be chums, huh?

266
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,000
[HANGE] That's how I came to
name the 7-meter Titan, "Beane,"

267
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,416
[HANGE] and his grinning
4-meter companion "Sawney."

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,583
[HANGE] The next step involved
sensory deprivation;

269
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,041
[HANGE] denying them sunlight.

270
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,208
[HANGE] Observing as we do
that Titans are less active

271
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,791
[HANGE] in the nocturnal hours,
we may extrapolate from this

272
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,458
[HANGE] experiment
that the sun is likely

273
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,166
[HANGE] a key source
of energy for them.

274
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,708
[HANGE] Nevertheless,
I discovered a

275
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,541
[HANGE] profound
difference between the two.

276
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,666
[HANGE] Well done, Sawney.

277
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,958
See you in the morning.
Sweet dreams, ya lug.

278
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,916
[HANGE] Corroborating previous
data, Sawney grew notably

279
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,916
[HANGE] sluggish after
only an hour's lack of sun.

280
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,166
My, my, someone's
certainly the night owl, huh?

281
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,666
You're going to
wear me out. Ah well.

282
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,208
This wouldn't be
my first all-nighter

283
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,916
in the name of science.

284
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,875
[HANGE] Beane, however,
still beamed three hours in.

285
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,166
[HANGE] A staggering
find, believe me.

286
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,666
They don't require
food or water to survive.

287
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,958
They possess vocal organs,

288
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,208
but have absolutely
no need to breathe.

289
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,125
The only thing their
bodies metabolize

290
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,125
into energy is sunlight.

291
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,583
[HANGE] Every Titan may have
a different threshold for

292
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,916
[HANGE] sunlight withdrawal,
so I have be careful.

293
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,208
[HANGE] Don't want 'em
dying on me, ya know?

294
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,916
Several have passed
on in captivity

295
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,666
owing to my
ignorance, sad to say.

296
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,833
Two in particular
perished of decapitation

297
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,541
when we accidentally
struck the soft spot.

298
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,875
[HANGE] Poor devils. Chikatiloni
and Albert, their names were.

299
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,000
[HANGE] Such adorable,
ear-to-ear smiles.

300
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:25,416
[HANGE] What I did to them
was terrible. It haunts me.

301
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,916
[HANGE] I mustn't
let that happen again.

302
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,666
[HANGE] I couldn't bear it.

303
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,541
Yeah, no. Sure.

304
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,541
Carrying on! Physical
contact with them was

305
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,541
the next obvious step,
because I simply had to know

306
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,083
whether or not they
experienced pain as you or I!

307
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,791
Whoa! It isn't necessary for
you to scream, Section Comma--

308
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,708
I can't do this and
not scream, damn you!

309
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,166
[HANGE] Look at him!
He's in absolute agony!

310
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:04,375
My poor Beane! I'm
so sorry! Hang in there!

311
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,916
[HANGE] It was the
only way to learn

312
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,500
[HANGE] if they
had any weaknesses.

313
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,333
[HANGE] Apart from
their napes, you see.

314
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,875
[HANGE] I hated myself for it.

315
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,083
[HANGE] Sawney. Sweet pea.

316
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,166
I've skewered you
straight through the heart.

317
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,833
Does it not hurt, dear?
Don't you feel that?

318
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,375
[HANGE] Sawney was
more, shall we say

319
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,541
[HANGE] introverted
than his counterpart.

320
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,708
[HANGE] If he felt pain,
he was unwilling to show it.

321
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,541
Go on. Talk to me.

322
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,375
[HANGE] Ow!

323
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,875
For the love of
god, stand clear!

324
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,833
You almost got me that
time, didn't ya, darling?

325
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,916
You want your
head chomped off?

326
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,083
[HANGE] Sawney's
range of expression is,

327
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,000
[HANGE] somewhat
limited, I think.

328
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,833
[HANGE] The only things he
knows to do are lunge and bite.

329
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,916
Commander. All due respect.

330
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,208
[EREN] But how can you be
so lighthearted about them?

331
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,000
[EREN] You talk like
they're badly behaved pets.

332
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,875
[EREN] It's just-- They're
the single greatest threat

333
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,583
[EREN] mankind has ever faced.

334
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,875
[EREN] They've nearly
driven us to extinction.

335
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,875
[EREN] You're a Scout,
you know that.

336
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,833
[EREN] You've seen them
in action countless times.

337
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:18,291
[HANGE] True. In fact, more
than my fair share of friends

338
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,750
[HANGE] have died in the jaws of
a Titan, right in front of me.

339
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,041
[HANGE] When I first became
a Scout, I fought them

340
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,458
[HANGE] out of pure,
white-hot hatred.

341
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,875
[HANGE] But one day,
I came to a realization.

342
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,333
[HANGE] I'd kicked
the severed head of

343
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,833
[HANGE] a 3-meter
Titan out of spite.

344
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,166
[HANGE] It weighed
next to nothing.

345
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,500
Might as well
have been a feather.

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,416
In the realm of
improbability, that fact would

347
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,250
seem to rank fairly high.

348
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,333
Their, utter strength
argues against it.

349
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,166
[HANGE] And such was
the case with every Titan.

350
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,708
[HANGE] Contrary
to the appearance

351
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,083
[HANGE] of density
and great mass,

352
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,750
[HANGE] the severed limbs
were light as tree bark.

353
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,791
[HAGE] I've been
given to understand that

354
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,125
[HANGE] when you
transform, your Titan body

355
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,791
[HANGE] materializes
as if out of thin air.

356
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,208
[HANGE] It's so bizarre.

357
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,791
In fact, the only
way I can think

358
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,000
to describe it is to say
their appearance stands

359
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,791
[HANGE] in sharp contrast
to their true substance.

360
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,083
We've been fumbling
around in the dark.

361
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,708
Our prime offensive tactic
based on contempt and fear.

362
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,041
We need a fresh strategy,
one guided by knowledge.

363
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,166
A whole new way of
looking at the enemy.

364
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,291
Of course it could be
a complete waste of time.

365
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,541
Still, though. Nothing
ventured, nothing gained.

366
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,291
[EREN] Joining the Scouts
has been an eye-opener.

367
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,000
[EREN] Shock after shock.

368
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,500
[EREN] And it's not just
Section Commander Hange.

369
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,708
[EREN] Everyone
here's a little off.

370
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,458
[EREN] It's like I've wandered
into a sanctuary for crackpots.

371
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,875
[EREN] But-- they're
striving for change.

372
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,333
[EREN] That's been the appeal
of the Scouts all along, right?

373
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,291
Commander Hange!

374
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,666
If you don't mind, I
think I should hear about

375
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,833
these experiments
in greater detail.

376
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,625
What? Really?

377
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,083
[EREN] Yes! I want
to know everything!

378
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,583
[EREN] If I'm going to help
you tomorrow, I'll need it.

379
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,625
Ah. Good point.

380
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,875
Well, I might've glossed over

381
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,416
one or two important
details. Right!

382
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,541
Full disclosure, then!
We may be here a while.

383
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,958
Good!

384
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,500
[HANGE] I ought to start
from our first captured Titan.

385
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,541
[HANGE] That was the birth of
my first hypothesis, you see.

386
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,583
[HANGE] Carried to its
natural conclusion, though,

387
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,708
[HANGE] the experiment yielded
nothing of positive value.

388
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,416
But listen to
me rambling on!

389
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,875
I'm sure you surmised
all this from your training.

390
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,958
They did cover
this stuff, right?

391
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,250
Yes. They did.
Every last bit.

392
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,041
[HANGE] Great!
We can use that as a

393
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,041
[HANGE] jumping off
point for my own theories!

394
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,416
[HANGE] Let us
review, shall we?

395
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,333
Huh? Well, I--

396
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,166
[HANGE] Consider
how the Titans sus--

397
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,583
Section Commander
Hange, come quickly!

398
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,833
[MOBLIT] The test subjects!

399
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,791
[MOBLIT] They're dead!
Both of them killed!

400
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,333
[Hange screaming]

401
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,583
[HANGE] Sawney! Beane!

402
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,458
How could this happen?!

403
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,666
Someone tell
me this isn't real!

404
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,541
[GUNTHER] They were
such valuable specimens.

405
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,166
Is this a soldier's work?

406
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,541
Yeah. But they haven't
pegged the one responsible yet.

407
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,041
[ELD] They were killed
just before dawn, apparently.

408
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,000
[ELD] By the time
the guards got here,

409
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,583
the bastard cleared
out on ODM gear.

410
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,375
Whoever it was
must've had a lookout

411
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,041
to warn him about the guards.

412
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,166
[HANGE] Sawney!

413
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,458
[ORUO] Oh dear.

414
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,916
Someone's gone stark
raving mad, haven't they?

415
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,208
How did this--
How'd it happen?

416
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,250
Let it go. This is a matter
for the Military Police.

417
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,166
Uh. Yes, sir.

418
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,708
What is it you think you see?

419
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,375
Who do you think
the real enemy is here?

420
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,541
[ERWIN] Ignore me.
Loaded question.

421
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,083
[NARRATOR] As the
manhunt for the assassin of

422
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,250
[NARRATOR] Sawney
and Beane gets underway.

423
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,291
[NARRATOR] Mikasa,
Armin, and their comrades

424
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,875
[NARRATOR] in the
104th Cadet Corps must,

425
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,791
[NARRATOR] for better or
worse, decide to which regiment

426
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,958
[NARRATOR] they
will pledge their lives.
