1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,666
[LEVI] C'mon. It's an easy
question. So answer it.

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,333
What the hell is
it you want to do?

3
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,500
I want to become a
member of the Scouts,

4
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:34,041
and slaughter every
Titan that crosses my path.

5
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,833
Huh. Well played.

6
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,708
[LEVI] Alright, then. I'll
take responsibility for him.

7
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,625
[LEVI] Let the higher-ups
know what's going on.

8
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,916
Not that I implicitly
trust him, of course.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,750
It's more a matter
of me trusting myself

10
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:54,083
to deal with him.
Kill him, if I have to.

11
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,541
The big wigs aren't
likely to raise a stink.

12
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,750
My record more than speaks
for itself, I'm pretty sure.

13
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,375
[LEVI] Good news, Jaeger.

14
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,458
[LEVI] You're now officially
a member of the Scouts.

15
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,916
[MAN 1] Hey.
You think it's true?

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,041
[MAN 1] There's a Titan
fighting on our side now?

17
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,500
[MAN 2] When did you start
believing everything you heard?

18
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,916
[MAN 2] More likely the
recapture plan failed.

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
[MAN 2] And now
refugees from Wall Rose

20
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,958
[MAN 2] are going to
start flooding in here.

21
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,666
[MAN 3] And once
those people swarm us,

22
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,916
[MAN 3] our supplies'll
run out in a matter of days.

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,083
[MAN 1] Wait. So if the
Wall Rose people really do

24
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,583
[MAN 1] have a Titan with them,

25
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,125
[MAN 1] you don't think
they'd be crazy enough to

26
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,125
[MAN 1] bring him
in here, do you?

27
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,000
[MAN 4] Hey. Have you
heard the good news?

28
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,458
[MAN 4] The military
has a Titan on the team!

29
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,500
[MAN 4] Can you
believe it? Who knows?

30
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,083
[MAN 4] We might even be
able to retake Wall Maria!

31
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,625
[MAN 4] Finally,
humanity has a Savior!

32
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,916
[various joy]

33
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,500
[MAN] Saviour, huh?

34
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,708
Since the dawn of history,

35
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,541
commoners have
always been a rash lot.

36
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,166
These rumors get any
more out of control,

37
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,041
we'll have a
revolt on our hands.

38
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,500
Not today. This
so-called "Savior"?

39
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,791
We'll make an
example out of him.

40
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,041
[MAN] I'll be damned if he's
allowed to join the Survey Corp.

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,291
Form ranks!

42
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,458
All hail to the Premier!

43
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,541
Damn, hot day.

44
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,791
[ERWIN] Commander Pyxis.

45
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,208
You're the C.O. of
the Garrison Regiment.

46
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,541
And I'm the
Commanding Officer of

47
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,541
the Survey Corp and the Scouts.

48
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,916
[ERWIN] Some people
might disapprove of

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,416
[ERWIN] our meeting like this.

50
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,041
[PYXIS] Ha! You're as straight-
laced as your reputation.

51
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,916
[PYXIS] Nothing untoward
here. We just coincidentally

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,333
[PYXIS] bumped into one another
while out for a morning stroll.

53
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,750
[PYXIS] Protocol
doesn't prevent us from

54
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,375
[PYXIS] chatting under
the circumstances.

55
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,875
You are aware the
Military Police plan to

56
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,708
take custody of
Eren Jaeger, I presume.

57
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,833
[ERWIN] Yes. I received
word yesterday.

58
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,250
[ERWIN] They plan to hold
a deliberation on the matter.

59
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,833
[PYXIS] Hm. The decision has
been left to Premier Zachary.

60
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,500
[PYXIS] Whether Cadet Jaeger's
future lies with the Scouts,

61
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,000
[PYXIS] or in the hands
of the Military Police.

62
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:13,583
[ERWIN] Zachary? You mean
Premier Dhalis Zachary?

63
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,833
[PYXIS] The Military Police.
The Garrison Regiment.

64
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,083
[PYXIS] And the Scouts.

65
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,375
[PYXIS] All three fall
under his jurisdiction.

66
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,666
[PYXIS] His decision will be
based entirely on one factor:

67
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,916
[PYXIS] Is Eren Jaeger's
existence a benefit

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,166
[PYXIS] or a handicap
to our survival?

69
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,541
[PYXIS] If deemed
detrimental, Jaeger will be

70
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,833
[PYXIS] executed
without a thought.

71
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,541
[PYXIS] Right then
and there, if need be.

72
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:39,083
[PYXIS] I, for one, do
not want to see him die.

73
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,750
[PYXIS] However, many
in the Garrison Regiment,

74
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,625
[PYXIS] I'm sad to
say, are fearful of

75
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:47,916
Eren's unique ability.
My hands are tied.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,791
The most I can do is avoid
agreeing with the M.P.'s.

77
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,291
[PYXIS] Do the odds favor you?

78
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,208
No, they don't.

79
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,875
And yet, we do have
a proposal prepared.

80
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,291
[ERWIN] Whether it
will work or not,

81
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,166
[ERWIN] all depends on
how the debate unfolds.

82
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,166
You mean, you're
going to play it by ear?

83
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,666
Our job is reconnaissance
beyond the walls.

84
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,541
Playing things by
ear is all we ever do.

85
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,000
Ha! [laughing]

86
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,916
[PYXIS] You're not so uptight
after all, it would seem.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,250
[PYXIS] Thank you for
the pleasant conversation.

88
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,291
[PYXIS] And
good luck, Commander!

89
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,666
[MIKASA] A debate over Eren?

90
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,791
What for?

91
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,291
[ARMIN] I'm not
really sure, but,

92
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,583
it might be about what
they plan to do with him.

93
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,000
And what does that mean?

94
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,125
It means...

95
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,375
they may not let him live.

96
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:52,625
Cadet Mikasa Ackerman. And
Cadet Armin Arlelt. Hop to!

97
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,125
[MIKASA] Sir!

98
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,416
[OFFICER] You're ordered to
attend and act as witnesses

99
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,791
at today's deliberation.

100
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,666
[EREN] 'Scuse me. I gotta pee.

101
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,666
No, you just went.

102
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,000
Then can I have some water?

103
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,083
[GUARD] Hey!

104
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,791
You're not getting a
thing, got it? Damn monster.

105
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:28,166
[EREN] Monster. I guess he's
not too far off the mark there.

106
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,208
[EREN] Frightened
of me or not, though,

107
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,708
[EREN] I don't deserve this.

108
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,958
[EREN] Except how
can I blame him?

109
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,958
[EREN] I don't even
understand what's going on.

110
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,083
[EREN] On the bright side,
at least these guards

111
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,208
[EREN] haven't
tried to kill me yet.

112
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,625
[EREN] When I think back,
they weren't afraid of me.

113
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,375
[EREN] Even after
everything they'd seen.

114
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,000
[EREN] I wonder what
they're doing now.

115
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:03,541
[EREN] And all the others.
I wonder what happened to them.

116
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,000
[ERWIN] Just hang on
a little longer, Eren.

117
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,791
[ERWIN] We'll keep trying
to sort all this out.

118
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,291
[EREN] I've been
in here so long.

119
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,208
[EREN] What's been happening
outside of these bars?

120
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,291
[EREN] I'm-- I'm
not going to spend

121
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,708
[EREN] the rest of my
life like this, am I?

122
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,500
So then, you're Eren?

123
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,500
[HANGE] Are you well?
How're things?

124
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,000
[HANGE] I'm really sorry
you've been waiting so long.

125
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,333
[HANGE] But here's your
chance to finally get out.

126
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,750
Uh.

127
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:48,875
One thing. You'll have to
put these on for me, okay?

128
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,500
[HANGE] My name is Zoe Hange.

129
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,666
I'm a section
commander for the Scouts.

130
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,750
This is a fellow
commander in the Scouts,

131
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,500
[HANGE] Miche Zacharius.

132
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,750
Uh...

133
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,041
[HANGE] Oh. Don't mind
him. He makes a habit of

134
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,541
[HANGE] giving new
people a thorough sniff.

135
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,958
[HANGE] Tends to laugh
through his nose a bit.

136
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,125
[HANGE] But I don't think
he intends it to be derisive.

137
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:17,208
[HANGE] Quirks aside, he is
a skilled section commander.

138
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,500
Oh, poo! Sorry. I've
just been prattling on

139
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,333
[HANGE] with the small
talk, and now we're here!

140
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,958
[HANGE] Well,
I'm sure it's fine.

141
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,041
[HANGE] It's probably better
if I don't explain, anyway.

142
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,500
Hey! Hold on!

143
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,166
[HANGE] It might seem
callous, but remember...

144
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,666
we've all put our
faith in you, Eren.

145
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,500
Best of luck!

146
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,041
[EREN] Wait!

147
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,708
[EREN] A courthouse?

148
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,291
[EREN] I was in the basement
of a courthouse this whole time?

149
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,291
[GUARD] All right. Move it!

150
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,125
On your knees. Now!

151
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,166
[EREN] Why're all of these
people here, just staring at me?

152
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,458
[EREN] Somebody gonna explain
what the hell's going on?

153
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,375
[EREN] My friends.

154
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,375
[door opening, then closing]

155
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,916
All right. Shall we begin?

156
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,750
Your name is Eren
Jaeger. And as a soldier,

157
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,666
you have sworn to give
up your life when called to,

158
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,333
[ZACHARY] for the good of
the people. Is that correct?

159
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,750
Yes.

160
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,375
[ZACHARY] As an enlisted
soldier during a time of war,

161
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,541
[ZACHARY] military doctrine
demands your tribunal

162
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,208
be held as a court-martial.

163
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,833
As Commander of
our armed forces,

164
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,666
this matter is
left to my discretion.

165
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,166
Thus, I will decide
whether you live or you die.

166
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,750
[ARMIN] I knew it!

167
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,750
[ZACHARY] Any objections?

168
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,291
No, sir.

169
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,291
[ZACHARY] Your astuteness is
appreciated. Let us proceed.

170
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,666
As expected, covering
up your existence

171
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,458
has proven quite fruitless.

172
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,916
[ZACHARY] And unless we publicly
disclose your existence

173
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,375
[ZACHARY] one way or
another, we risk the outbreak

174
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,083
[ZACHARY] of widespread
civil unrest.

175
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,666
[ZACHARY]
A choice must be made.

176
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,541
[ZACHARY] And the regiment
that takes custody of you

177
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,291
[ZACHARY] will
determine your fate.

178
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,250
[ZACHARY] The Military Police...

179
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,916
[ZACHARY] or
the Scout Regiment?

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,750
[ZACHARY] To begin.
The Military Police

181
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,416
[ZACHARY] will now
present their case.

182
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,208
[MAN] Thank you.
My name is Nile Dawk.

183
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,083
[NILE] I am Commander
of the Military Police.

184
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,083
Our recommendation, following
a thorough examination

185
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,666
of his physiology,
subject Eren Jaeger

186
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,916
should be disposed
of immediately.

187
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,000
[NILE] We acknowledge that
Jaeger's ability played a part

188
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,500
in turning back the
latest Titan incursion.

189
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,333
[NILE] However, as has been
stated, his mere existence

190
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,166
[NILE] is creating a swell
of rebellious sentiment.

191
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,666
For the greater good,
after we have gathered all

192
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,458
the information
that we can from him,

193
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,125
we would see him made a
fallen warrior of humanity.

194
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,083
[MAN] Unacceptable!

195
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,916
This verminous fiend has
defiled the mighty Wall...

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,458
[EREN] Another deranged
Wall Cultist.

197
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,958
[EREN] Five years ago,
everyone ignored them.

198
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,250
[EREN] Now they've
actually got some clout.

199
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,500
And now I'd like to hear the
Scout Regiment's proposed plan.

200
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,916
[ERWIN] Yes, sir.

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,541
As the commander
of the Survey Corp,

202
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,916
I, Erwin Smith,
propose the following:

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,416
Let Eren join our
ranks. Reinstate him as

204
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,166
a full member of the
Scouts, and we will utilize

205
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,250
[ERWIN] his Titan ability
to retake Wall Maria.

206
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,333
That is all.

207
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,208
[ZACHARY] Hm? Is that it?

208
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,875
[ERWIN] Yes. With
his assistance, sir,

209
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,333
[ERWIN] I'm certain we
can reclaim Wall Maria.

210
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,958
[ERWIN] Ergo, I believe our top
priority is perfectly clear.

211
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,333
Quite bold. Assuming
you were given clearance,

212
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,541
where do you plan to
launch this operation from?

213
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,000
Commander Pyxis.

214
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,458
The wall in Trost District
has been completely sealed,

215
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,958
is that correct?

216
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:31,083
[PYXIS] Yes. I doubt its
gate will ever open again.

217
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,333
[ERWIN] We'll depart from
Calaneth District, to the east.

218
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,500
From there, we'll
make for Shiganshina.

219
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,916
A new route can be
establish as we proceed.

220
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,125
But that's ridiculous!
Our time and money would

221
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,375
be better spent
sealing up all the gates!

222
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,916
They're the only
parts of the Wall

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,208
that the Colossal
Titan can break, right?

224
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,083
Let's reinforce
the blasted things

225
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,083
and wash our hands
of the entire affair!

226
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,541
[SCOUT 14] Shut your mouth,
you spineless merchant dog!

227
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,875
[SCOUT 14] With a
Titan on our side,

228
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,750
[SCOUT 14] we can finally
return to Wall Maria!

229
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,291
[MERCHANT] We can't afford any
more of your childish antics,

230
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,250
[MERCHANT] or your
delusions of grandeur!

231
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,125
Squealing louder
won't help your case, pig.

232
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,375
[LEVI] While we're
bolstering our defenses,

233
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,708
do you think the Titans
are going to stand idly by?

234
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,500
And when you say "we can't
afford," do you speak for

235
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:17,125
anyone other than
your fat merchant friends?

236
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,541
[LEVI] Do you pigs even
realize that most of our people

237
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,458
[LEVI] are struggling
just to survive off

238
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,500
[LEVI] what little
land we have left?

239
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,541
I'm simply saying
that sealing the gates

240
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,750
is the only guaranteed
protection we've got!

241
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,541
Hold your tongue, you
vile, belligerent heretic!

242
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,750
Are you really suggesting
that we lowly humans

243
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,583
meddle with Wall Rose,
a gift to us from on high?

244
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,000
[MAN] The Wall is a miracle.

245
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,333
[MAN] And its divinity
transcends human comprehension.

246
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,958
[MAN] Don't you understand?

247
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,125
It's that cult's fault.
They're the ones who

248
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,458
delayed the garrison's
arming of the Walls.

249
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,916
That shows you the
sick amount of support

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,458
and power they've got.
I don't trust them at all.

251
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,625
[MERCHANT] ...to pieces!

252
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,875
[MAN] Such sacrilege!

253
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,500
[MERCHANT] Oh, you're
insane. Shut yer trap!

254
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,958
[MAN] How dare you!

255
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,333
[ZACHARY] Order! I ask
that you save your personal

256
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,791
[ZACHARY] sentiments for
a more appropriate venue.

257
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,125
[ZACHARY] Now then Mr. Jaeger,
I have a question for you.

258
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,250
[ZACHARY] As a soldier,
you have made a solemn pledge

259
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,125
[ZACHARY] to answer
humanity's call.

260
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,875
[ZACHARY] Can you still serve
by controlling your ability?

261
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,750
Yes! I will, sir!

262
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,666
[ZACHARY] Oh? Is that so?

263
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,000
But this report from the

264
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,041
Battle for Trost
contradicts that statement.

265
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,375
Just after transforming,

266
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,083
[ZACHARY] it seems
you made an attempt to

267
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,083
[ZACHARY]
crush Mikasa Ackerman.

268
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,750
[ARMIN] He doesn't
even remember.

269
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,333
[ARMIN] He completely
lost control.

270
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,166
What'd you expect? You want
me to lie in the report?

271
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,916
Glossing over that
important fact could

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,750
potentially spell
disaster for us all.

273
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,875
[ZACHARY] And who is
this Mikasa Ackerman?

274
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,083
Me! That would be me, sir.

275
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,708
Alright, then. Is it
true that Eren Jaeger

276
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,666
assaulted you while
he was in Titan form?

277
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:55,625
Answer the Premier honestly.
Eren's future depends on it.

278
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,875
Yes. All of that's true.

279
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,708
[whispers and gasps]

280
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,541
[MERCHANT] I knew it! He's
a wolf in sheep's clothing!

281
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,500
[EREN] I-- I tried
to kill Mikasa?

282
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,666
[EREN] What's happening to me?

283
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,083
[MIKASA] However, he also
saved my life twice before.

284
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,000
And in each circumstance he
was using his Titan ability.

285
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,833
The first:
shortly after Trost fell.

286
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,916
[MIKASA] I was nearly
killed by a Titan.

287
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,458
[MIKASA] But then Eren came.

288
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,791
[MIKASA] He stepped
in and protected me.

289
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,458
[MIKASA] The second
time: he transformed to

290
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,291
[MIKASA] shield Armin
and me from cannon fire.

291
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,958
I implore you to take these
facts into consideration.

292
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,541
[NILE] Objection!

293
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,666
I have reason to believe
that personal feelings

294
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,333
play a large
part in her testimony.

295
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,250
Let the record show
that Mikasa Ackerman

296
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,000
was orphaned at a young age

297
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,458
and was subsequently taken
in by the Jaeger family.

298
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,875
[NILE] What's more,
our own internal

299
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,083
[NILE] investigation
into this matter

300
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,875
led to a most
shocking discovery.

301
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,500
Eren Jaeger
and Mikasa Ackerman,

302
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,458
at the tender age of nine,
dealt with three adult

303
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,291
[NILE] kidnappers by
stabbing all of them to death.

304
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,708
[NILE] Granted, this
was done in self-defense.

305
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,750
[NILE] All the same, one
cannot help but question

306
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,958
[NILE] the violent
nature of the act.

307
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,250
[Nile] Knowing all of this,
should we really invest in him?

308
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,458
[NILE] Money, manpower. Perhaps
the very fate of us all?

309
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,083
[MAN] Maybe he's a
Titan that snuck in here

310
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,333
[MAN] after taking the form
of some little child he ate?

311
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,250
Maybe she's one! I bet
she's not human either!

312
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,791
[MAN] Yeah, you're right!

313
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,875
[MAN] Dissect her too,
just to be safe!

314
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,250
Now hold on a second!
Maybe I'm a monster

315
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,208
that you want dead, but
you leave her out of this!

316
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,500
[EREN] She's innocent!

317
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,958
[MAN 1] Like we'd trust you!

318
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,208
It's the truth!

319
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,541
[MAN 2] She must be
one if you protect her!

320
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,000
Stop it!

321
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:56,666
[EREN] You're wrong.
About it all.

322
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,333
[EREN] But you're so intent
on pushing selfish agendas,

323
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,583
[EREN] you're blind to
what's in front of you.

324
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,958
Wait. What do you mean?

325
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,375
What does it even matter?

326
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,625
[EREN] What am I saying?

327
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,583
None of you have
even seen a Titan,

328
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,041
so why're you so afraid, huh?

329
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,291
[EREN] Maybe I should
just keep quiet.

330
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,791
[EREN] No. If
they wanna kill me,

331
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,791
[EREN] I'll let them
know exactly what I think.

332
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,916
There's no sense in
having power if you're

333
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,875
not going to use it to fight!

334
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,833
[EREN] If you're too scared
to fight for your lives, fine.

335
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,125
[EREN] Let me do it!

336
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,875
You-- You're all cowards!

337
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,125
[MAN] What?

338
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:37,916
Just shut up. And put
all your faith in me!

339
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,583
Take aim, dammit!

340
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,041
Right! Yes, sir!

341
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,916
[EREN] Huh?

342
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,500
[Eren wheezing]

343
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,250
[gasp and growling]

344
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,750
Mikasa, wait!

345
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,708
[LEVI] You know, personally,

346
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,916
[LEVI] I think nothing
instills discipline like pain.

347
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You don't need a
good "talking-to".

348
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,291
What you're in need of,
boy, is to be taught a lesson.

349
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,666
[LEVI] And you happen to be
in perfect kicking position.

350
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:33,750
[Eren gasping]

351
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,125
N-Now hold on, Levi!

352
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,791
What is it?

353
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,791
It's dangerous.

354
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,375
[NILE] What if he gets
angry? Turns into a Titan?

355
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,875
Don't be silly.

356
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,416
After all, you guys just want
to dissect him, don't you?

357
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,791
During the time that
he was transformed,

358
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,125
they say that Jaeger was
able to kill twenty Titans

359
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,500
before he finally
ran out of strength.

360
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,583
As an enemy, his
intelligence makes him

361
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,750
all the more dangerous.

362
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,125
[LEVI] But I could still take
him down without a problem.

363
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,000
[LEVI] How many of
you can say the same?

364
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,875
[LEVI] Before you torment
the beast, you'd better think.

365
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,833
[LEVI] Can you
actually kill him?

366
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,333
[ERWIN] Sir.
I have a proposition.

367
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,833
Proceed.

368
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,416
There's still too
much we don't know.

369
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,125
And no doubt, his danger
will be ever present.

370
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,791
As such, I suggest this:

371
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,291
[ERWIN] Eren Jaeger
will be placed under

372
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,375
[ERWIN] Captain
Levi's supervision.

373
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,958
[ERWIN] And we'll
conduct a recon mission

374
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,375
[ERWIN] outside of the wall.

375
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,083
[ZACHARY] Jaeger will join
you in this excursion?

376
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,666
[ERWIN] Yes, sir. Then you can

377
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,500
[ERWIN] look upon the
mission's results yourself.

378
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,250
And if he successfully
controls his ability...

379
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,041
Eren will have proven
his value to mankind.

380
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,333
Eren Jaeger will
be closely supervised?

381
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,375
And if he should lose control?

382
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,333
[ERWIN] I can definitely
kill him, if it comes to that.

383
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,000
[ERWIN] The only downside is,

384
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,958
[ERWIN] there's absolutely
no middle ground.

385
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:10,291
Hm. Then I
have made my choice.

386
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,416
[HANGE] Well that went
better than I expected.

387
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,833
Does it hurt?

388
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:19,958
Yeah.

389
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah? Describe it to me!

390
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,541
Huh?

391
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,375
[ERWIN] Sorry for all that.

392
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,958
[ERWIN] But the
theatrics did get you

393
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,500
[ERWIN] placed in our custody.

394
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,333
[EREN] No, I understand.

395
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,250
[ERWIN] I can assure
you the pain was worth it.

396
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,958
[ERWIN] We played our trump
card at the perfect time.

397
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,750
You have my utmost respect.

398
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,250
Eren, I'm glad that
you're on our team.

399
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,458
Uh? Me, too!
Glad to be here, sir!

400
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,208
So, Eren.

401
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,625
[EREN] Sir?

402
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,583
You don't resent
me now, do you?

403
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:57,708
N-- No. I can see that what
you did was necessary, sir.

404
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,291
Good. Then you understand.

405
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,791
[HANGE] Still, don't you
think you went too far?

406
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,833
[HANGE] I mean, you
knocked his tooth out!

407
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,000
Neat, huh?

408
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,958
[LEVI] You picked
it up? How disgusting.

409
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,500
[HANGE] This is a precious
sample I'll have you know!

410
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:13,166
Hey, just be glad people
like that aren't dissecting you.

411
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,666
[HANGE] Don't you dare
to compare me with them.

412
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,666
[HANGE] I would never
even dream of killing him.

413
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,875
Hey, Eren. Let me take a look
inside that mouth of yours!

414
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,333
[HANGE] Your tooth...

415
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,125
[HANGE] it grew back.

416
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,708
[NARRATOR] After achieving
his long-held dream

417
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,083
[NARRATOR] of joining
the elite Scout Regiment,

418
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,166
[NARRATOR] Eren finds
the vaunted Scouts are

419
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,291
[NARRATOR] an eccentric band
of soldiers and searchers.

420
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:22,000
[NARRATOR] A haven for oddballs,
misfits and iconoclasts.
