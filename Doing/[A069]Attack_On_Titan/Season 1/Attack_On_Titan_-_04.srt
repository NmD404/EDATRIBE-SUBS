1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,416
[NARRATOR] In the year 845,
two terrifying new breeds

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,875
[NARRATOR] of Titan appeared:
the Colossal and the Armored,

3
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,625
[NARRATOR] barreling
through the outer walls as if

4
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,416
[NARRATOR] wholesale
destruction was child's play.

5
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,375
[NARRATOR] In blood and
thunder, our way of life ended;

6
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,875
[NARRATOR] the Titans
fed their hunger

7
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,208
[NARRATOR] for human
flesh unchecked.

8
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:40,458
Stop it! No!

9
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,375
[NARRATOR] The territory
couched within the circle

10
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,750
[NARRATOR] of Wall
Maria was abandoned.

11
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,625
[NARRATOR] Twenty percent
of the human race perished.

12
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,583
[NARRATOR] As the
Titan onslaught advanced,

13
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,250
[NARRATOR] our only choice was
to withdraw behind Wall Rose.

14
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,583
[KEITH] Pick up the pace,
you lead-heeled laggards!


15
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,000
Your boots
water-logged, Arlelt?

16
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,458
[KEITH] Let's see some hustle!

17
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,291
Gear too heavy for
you, son? Hell, drop it!

18
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,708
[KEITH] Leave it in the mud!

19
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,416
The Titans'll have
easier work digesting you

20
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,791
without all the excess baggage.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,625
Dammit.

22
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,625
[REINER] Seriously?

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,125
Here. Focus on staying upright.

24
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,750
We are being graded
on this, you know?

25
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,708
Thanks, but uh. Won't they
demerit you for helping?

26
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,375
Yeah, if they find out.

27
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,958
Just make the cut
and we're even, alright?

28
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,708
[KEITH] Reiner Braun.

29
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,583
[KEITH] The mind and
constitution of a grass-fed ox.

30
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,250
[KEITH] Respected
by his comrades.

31
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,333
I'm no one's burden,
you hear me?

32
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,750
[KEITH] Armin Arlelt.

33
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,958
[KEITH] Built like a daffodil,
but academically brilliant.

34
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,958
Annie Leonhart.
Gifted with a sword,

35
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,416
but does not exactly
play well with others.

36
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,083
Bertholdt Hoover.

37
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,125
Heaps of native talent,
but too mild-mannered.

38
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,208
Jean Kirschtein.
Head of the class on ODM;

39
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,500
also an insufferable smartass
with a hair-trigger temper.

40
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,458
Think those showoffs
can slice and dice?

41
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,166
Best hope you see
a Titan before I do!

42
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,458
Military Police.
Save a place for Jean!

43
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,333
Way to lead the charge!

44
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,333
You don't care if I
steal your thunder, right?

45
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,208
Yeah-ah! Woo hoo!

46
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,000
[KEITH] Sasha Braus.
Unusually fine instincts.

47
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,500
[KEITH] Rarely shares them
with her teammates.

48
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:01,166
[KEITH] Conny Springer.
Agile on the switchbacks.

49
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,041
[KEITH] Few sandwiches
shy of a picnic.

50
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,333
Get ready.

51
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,833
Damn it! Still not deep enough!

52
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:21,083
[KEITH] Mikasa Ackermann. Model
cadet. Excels in everything.

53
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,583
[KEITH] In fact,
it's no overstatement

54
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,208
[KEITH] to call
the girl a genius.

55
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,833
[KEITH] Eren Jaeger.
Lackluster in the classroom,

56
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,750
[KEITH] marginally
better in the field.

57
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,500
[KEITH] But. Driven
by a sense of purpose

58
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,750
[KEITH] that's
almost terrifying.

59
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,583
Ahhhhh!

60
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,833
Ah!

61
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,500
[EREN] Sorry, man. I've really
gotta learn to hold back.

62
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,666
Eh, it's alright. Let's
see how you do as the Rogue.

63
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,458
[REINER]
What're you waitin' on?

64
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,958
[EREN] This training
doesn't make sense.

65
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,833
We're not exactly picking fights
with someone our own size.

66
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,541
A guy'd have to be stupid
to use this. I mean, a knife?

67
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,000
[REINER] What if
there's not an option?

68
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,500
The fight doesn't give us a
say. If it wants to get ugly,

69
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,916
it gets ugly. It's our
job to be prepared.

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,500
[REINER] The enemy
comes in many forms.

71
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:33,041
[REINER] Artillery's not
always gonna be the answer.

72
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,000
Soldiers, the ones
worth their salt anyway,

73
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,833
are ready for anything.

74
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,166
Don't believe me? Look.

75
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,125
[EREN] Yeah? What about her?

76
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,958
Only thing she's ready for
is any chance to slack off.

77
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,916
You think so? Maybe somebody
ought to give her a talkin' to.

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,083
Give her a li'l hard-knocks
lesson in preparedness.

79
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,291
Commandant not
beaten you down enough?

80
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,916
Keep it up, you'll be as flat
as the dirt you're walking on.

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,333
I suggest you think back to why
you enlisted in the first place.

82
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,666
[EREN] Uh. What are you doing?

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,458
Whoa, she's pissed. Wow, I
thought she looked scary before.

84
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,500
You couldn't pay me
enough to be on her bad side.

85
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,541
Okay! Now, go get 'er!

86
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,916
Huh? What the hell? Wait.

87
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,000
Right. I hope you don't expect
me to hold back. Heads up!

88
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:44,416
Ugh. Son of a--!
That was a dirty move!

89
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,958
Are we done here?

90
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,750
Not just yet. You know the
drill: take up the dagger.

91
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,250
No, wait! This
isn't how-- Oh crap.

92
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,500
There.

93
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,250
So you ready to take me
on yourself yet or what?

94
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,375
Uh. Not exactly.

95
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,875
[EREN] Don't you dare.

96
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,750
She's got a lesson coming,
right? You go get her.

97
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:24,041
Yeah. A soldier can't really
afford to back down either.

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,791
Get ready, here I c--

99
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,791
[EREN] That's some
technique you've got.

100
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,666
[EREN] Who taught you
how to fight like that?

101
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,625
My father did.

102
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,041
[EREN] He, like,
pioneer it or--?

103
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,958
Does it really matter?

104
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,666
[ANNIE] It's pointless,
just like all this.

105
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,666
Wait, you mean the
training in general?

106
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,416
Hand-to-hand
combat doesn't really

107
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,583
count against our final grade.

108
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,958
[ANNIE] The smart
ones blow it off.

109
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,541
It's a crapshoot anyway.
Only the top ten cadets get to

110
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:00,416
serve in the Interior.
The rest of us? Forget it.

111
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,458
[ANNIE] Point is,
only the idiots like you

112
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,250
[ANNIE] take this part
of boot camp seriously.

113
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,791
[ANNIE] Idiots.
And whatever they are.

114
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,125
Oh-- Hello, sir.

115
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,833
First rule of this life, kid.

116
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,666
The better you are at
dropping the bad guys,

117
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,875
the more distance the
powers-that-be put between you.

118
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,791
That's what this whole
stupid farce is about.

119
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,333
Sure. Whatever you say!

120
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:33,166
Face it. You don't fight
the nature of things and win.

121
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,333
Look around you, Eren.
All the sons of bitches

122
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:47,333
really expect us to do is play
the game. Don't be a pawn.

123
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,625
[REINER] Yeah, well I still
stand by what I said earlier.

124
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,166
I've been so fixated on building
myself up, I couldn't see it.

125
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,666
She's absolutely right.

126
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,250
They're not honing
their skills to fight.

127
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,000
They're honing
their skill to run.

128
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,583
[ARMIN] I know, okay.

129
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,125
And look, I'm not
saying it's right,

130
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,666
it's just the way things are.

131
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,291
Before Wall Maria
was compromised,

132
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,291
ODM experts were rare.

133
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,791
[ARMIN] Only Scouts ever
risked proximity to the Titans,

134
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,291
[ARMIN] and their regiment
wasn't large to begin with.

135
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,541
[JEAN] That's how
you conserve fuel.

136
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,458
Let your momentum
do the work for you.

137
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,791
[DAZ] Still, that's
pretty advanced.

138
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,500
Duh. It's called
having a sixth sense

139
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,916
for the finer
points of your gear.

140
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,000
You gotta do the strut
if you wanna make the cut.

141
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,125
[JEAN] The MP only
recruit the best.

142
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:43,291
Ah. Man, that'd be amazing.
Workin' within a stone's throw

143
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,333
of the king. No
greater honor than that.

144
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,916
[JEAN] Shut up, Marco.

145
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,000
[JEAN] We're not children. You
can drop the misty-eyed B.S.

146
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,875
Honor doesn't have
any damn part of it.

147
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,958
You just want a nice,
cushy job in the Interior

148
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,541
playing glorified sentry.

149
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,625
That's not true!
That's not me at all!

150
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,291
[EREN] Listen to you guys.

151
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,791
Interior? Five years ago,
this was part of it.

152
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,791
You got a point to make,
friend? I'm right here.

153
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,875
Poor Jean. So
misguided. And besides,

154
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,708
I don't think your head'll
fit in the Interior anyway.

155
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,083
[snickering]

156
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,375
Very funny.

157
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,708
Seems a little backwards to me.

158
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,625
Fine-tuning your
Titan-killing skills so

159
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,291
the brass'll station you
somewhere you'll never see one.

160
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,291
You'd rather I was
good at gettin' killed?

161
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,583
Thank you, but I'll pass.

162
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,208
Better to play the system
than get gnawed on.

163
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,291
You son of bitch!

164
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,125
Bring it on,
you little bastard!

165
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,750
Eren, please stop it!

166
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,208
Gentlemen, please.

167
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,500
You think you can judge me?

168
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,333
Huh? You rip my
shirt, you're dead!

169
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,541
[JEAN] I don't give a damn about
your shirt! You piss me off!

170
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,833
[EREN] What? Are you crazy?

171
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, wait. I get it.

172
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:08,416
[EREN] He has something
to prove. Sounds familiar.

173
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,750
[EREN] Sorry to do this.

174
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,916
[EREN] It's only to end this
before things get out of hand.

175
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,583
Dammit! What the
hell was that move?

176
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,083
Little something I picked up
this afternoon while you were

177
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,416
busy with your
thumb up your ass.

178
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,291
You honestly believe
the Military Police

179
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,333
are your ticket
to the good life?

180
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:43,500
[EREN] You're not a
soldier. You're a joke.

181
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,916
Would someone care to explain

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,416
the little ruckus
I heard just now?

183
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,083
I do hope
everything's all right.

184
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,500
Sasha passed
some gas, Commandant.

185
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,500
Why am I not surprised?

186
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,583
For the love of god,
learn some self-control.

187
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,958
[NARRATOR] Of the
original recruits,

188
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,916
[NARRATOR] two-hundred and
eighteen cadets graduated.

189
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,833
[NARRATOR] Some with honors.

190
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,166
[COMMANDER] Do you have heart?

191
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,000
Sir!

192
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,958
[COMMANDER] As of this moment,
you have three options

193
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,083
[COMMANDER] open
to you. Choose wisely.

194
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,291
[COMMANDER]
The Garrison Regiment,

195
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,583
[COMMANDER] whose job
is to reinforce the Walls.

196
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,833
[COMMANDER] The Scout Regiment,

197
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,375
[COMMANDER] who rides
out into Titan country

198
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,291
[COMMANDER] to take
back what was once ours.

199
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,750
[COMMANDER] And the MP Regiment,

200
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,041
[COMMANDER] maintaining
law and order

201
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,541
[COMMANDER] under orders
from His Royal Majesty.

202
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,625
Those cadets eligible for
the MP have already been named.

203
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,916
The rest of you, take a look.
These are the top of your class.

204
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,541
[EREN] This is it.
We've made it.

205
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:13,875
[EREN] Our time is now.
Titans, be ready!

206
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,250
[cheering]

207
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,666
Alright! MP, here I come!

208
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,291
Three square meals
a day for life!

209
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,958
How in god's name did
I get ranked under Eren?

210
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,541
You're really gonna turn your
back on the MP for the Scouts?

211
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,416
Why in the world would you
do that? You're in the top ten.

212
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,916
The Scouts have
always been my goal.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't want the easy life. Not
with all the work I've put in.

214
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,291
[EREN] I trained
to fight Titans.

215
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,166
Are you insane?

216
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,916
How many people have died?

217
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,625
We're talkin' a fifth
of the population!

218
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,500
[THOMAS] If that doesn't
paint a picture for you,

219
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,750
[THOMAS] I don't know what will.

220
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:14,125
[THOMAS] This is our life
now. We can't beat them.

221
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,666
[EREN] Yeah? So what?

222
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,541
We buckle? Take
it all lying down?

223
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,625
[EREN] Things have changed.

224
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,166
Maybe not a helluva
lot, but enough.

225
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,416
They aren't the mystery
they were five years ago.

226
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,958
[EREN] There's still a long way
to go, but we've made progress.

227
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,416
[EREN] Every battle we
lost taught us a lesson,

228
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,750
[EREN] gave us
the tiniest inroad

229
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,291
[EREN] toward
something like hope.

230
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,375
[EREN] You tellin' me it's
better to cut our losses?

231
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,666
[EREN] Let all the death and
destruction be meaningless?

232
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,833
[EREN] Just to ball up and
accept it? Not on your life!

233
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,458
[EREN] Humanity's future
lies outside the walls,

234
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,000
and I'm gonna clear the way!

235
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,125
I'm gonna take
back what was ours!

236
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,916
I'll drive them out.
And as long as at least

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,708
one of us can say
that, we're not done.

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,708
[ARMIN] Eren, wait!

239
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,666
Yeah, good luck
out there, hotshot.

240
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,666
I'll root for you from
His Majesty's barracks.

241
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:33,000
[ARMIN] That was, uh, quite
a speech you gave us there.

242
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,041
Yeah. Most of it was yours.

243
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,833
All that stuff you used
to say back in the day.

244
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,875
Yeah, well I'm joining
the Scout Regiment, too!

245
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,125
Now you're just
being stupid. Come on!

246
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,750
You're not a fighter!
Your life is with books!

247
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:52,458
I'm through with letting
other people fight for me.

248
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,875
[MIKASA] Guess it's the
Scouts for me, too, then.

249
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,875
Oh, come on! You were
top of the class!

250
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,708
You'd be wasting your shot!

251
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:03,666
[MIKASA] Understand this,
Eren. Where you go, I go.

252
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,208
I made a promise to
your mom before she died.

253
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,291
I'm not letting you die.

254
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,958
I've got your back
whether you like it or not.

255
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,583
So just deal with it.

256
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,500
Yeah. Well, Mom's not here.

257
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,625
A lot of the people I used to
care about aren't here either.

258
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:31,250
♪

259
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:39,666
♪

260
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,291
[COMMONER] Heads up!

261
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,291
[COMMONER] The main unit
of the Scout Regiment is back!

262
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,541
[COMMONER] That's right,
Commander Erwin!

263
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,083
[COMMONER] Did ya give those
ugly bastards a thrashing?

264
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,458
Look! It's Captain Levi!

265
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,375
[COMMONER] They say he's like
an entire brigade unto himself!

266
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,166
Spare me, please.

267
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,208
Feel how excited everybody is?

268
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,500
It's like the crowd just
has a different energy now.

269
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,583
Well, we are going on
five years without incident.

270
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,833
Seems like a good omen.

271
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,083
And you should check
out all the cannon upgrades.

272
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,625
The sight alone oughta
be enough to scare 'em off.

273
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,125
That's the truth.

274
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,750
You in denial 'cause you're
a couple? What's that about?

275
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,208
Whoa whoa whoa! This isn't
what it looks like! Okay?

276
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,541
Knock it off, man!
It's embarrassing!

277
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,500
[laughing]

278
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,458
Hey hey, lookie here!

00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,500
Mr. Hannes!

280
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,083
Word on the street's they
let you graduate yesterday.

281
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,625
Either you've grown up
or standards have plummeted.

282
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,416
Oh yeah, like
you're one to talk!

283
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,833
The Corps of Engineers keep
their new chief in the drink?

284
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,291
Watch it.

285
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,666
I'm sorry if this is out of the
blue. But I want you to know

286
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,166
you're Mom's death
still haunts me.

287
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,791
Me too, but it
wasn't your fault.

288
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,000
We were shooting
in the dark then.

289
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,791
But nothing like
that's gonna happen again.

290
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,291
We know what we're
dealing with now.

291
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:08,000
Fired up and capable make
a good combination, kid.

292
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,041
Don't screw it up by dyin'.

293
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,833
What? The hell you mean
you're joining the Scouts?

294
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,458
What happened to the MP?
That was your whole thing!

295
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,750
Don't worry about it!

296
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,500
A guy's allowed to
change his mind, okay?

297
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,541
[MINA] I think your speech
yesterday lit a fire under him.

298
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,125
[CONNY] Ain't nobody
talkin' to you!

299
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,625
His temper tantrum
had nothing to do with it.

300
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,416
[THOMAS] Take it easy.

301
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,333
It's not like
you're the only one.

302
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,416
What? Are you serious?

303
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,583
[SASHA] Can you
guys keep a secret?

304
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,958
'Cause I totally
just helped myself

305
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,958
to the Officer's Pantry.

306
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,666
Sasha! They can throw your
butt in the clink for that!

307
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,416
Seriously, what
is wrong with you?

308
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,208
What isn't wrong with her?

309
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,958
It'll be fine.
I'm willing to share.

310
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,250
Oh, can you
imagine the sandwiches?

311
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,625
[CONNY] Put it back!

312
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,041
[MINA] Yeah! Do you have
any idea how rare meat's been

313
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,958
since the Titans
took Wall Maria?

314
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,875
[SASHA] Um, li'l bit. Yeah.

315
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,333
Just look at it
this way. Pretty soon,

316
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,916
[SASHA] we'll take back all
the room we need for livestock.

317
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,458
I would really
like a slice, please!

318
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,333
Hey if he gets one,
so do I! Just so you know.

319
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,166
Me, too! I'm in on it, too!

320
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,250
But.

321
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,666
[SAMUEL] Come on!
Don't just stand there.

322
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,291
If they see us slacking
off, we're in for it.

323
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,458
See you guys at lunchtime.

324
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,625
[EREN] Has it really
been five years?

325
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,125
[EREN] Look at us.
Ready to stand tall again.

326
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,958
We can do it.

327
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:59,166
Mankind didn't start this fight,
but we're gonna finish it!

328
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,583
It's hot!

329
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,375
[CONNY] Samuel!

330
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,416
[MINA] Sasha!

331
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,291
Try not to move! Understand?

332
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,416
That was too damn close.

333
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,750
[gasp]

334
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,208
Oh god, no. Not again!

335
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,875
[CONNY] They're gonna
get in. They're gonna get in.

336
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,958
[CONNY] They're gonna get in!

337
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,833
[EREN] No. This is over.

338
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,291
I'm gonna put a stop to this!

339
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,208
I will. This ends now.

340
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:17,250
[EREN] This is it,
people! Do or die!

341
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,583
Mounted Cannon Squad Four,
take out the Colossal Titan!

342
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:24,750
This is our chance!
Don't let it slip away!

343
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:37,916
You. It's been a while.

344
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:17,000
[NARRATOR] The jaws of Hell
reopen. Before you can even

345
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,458
[NARRATOR] catch your breath,
you're between its teeth.

346
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,041
[NARRATOR] Sometimes, saving
the people dearest to you

347
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:26,416
[NARRATOR] means making
the ultimate sacrifice.
