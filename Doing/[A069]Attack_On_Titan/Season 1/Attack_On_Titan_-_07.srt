1
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,875
[NARRATOR] They first appeared
over a hundred years ago.

2
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,958
[NARRATOR] Giant,
humanoid creatures

3
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,250
[NARRATOR] with a
taste for our blood.

4
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,083
[NARRATOR] The brute strength
of these aberrations trumped

5
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,041
[NARRATOR] an average
person's many times over.

6
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,416
[NARRATOR] We were
shoved to the brink

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,208
[NARRATOR] of extinction
almost overnight.

8
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:48,875
[NARRATOR] The survivors erected
Walls Maria, Rose, and Sina;

9
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,458
[NARRATOR] withdrawing behind
them in frightened huddles

10
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,916
[NARRATOR] for what was to
be a century of uneasy peace.

11
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:00,041
[NARRATOR] In the year 845,
two terrifying new breeds

12
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,291
[NARRATOR] of Titan appeared:
the Colossal and the Armored,

13
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,125
[NARRATOR] barreling
through the outer walls as if

14
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,041
[NARRATOR] wholesale
destruction was child's play.

15
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,750
[NARRATOR] The territory
couched within the circle

16
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,166
[NARRATOR] of Wall
Maria was abandoned.

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,916
[NARRATOR] Twenty percent
of the human race perished.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,958
[NARRATOR] As the
Titan onslaught advanced,

19
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:24,625
[NARRATOR] our only choice was
to withdrawal behind Wall Rose.

20
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:30,750
[NARRATOR] In the year 850, the
Colossal appeared once again,

21
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,750
[NARRATOR] breaching
the wall bordering Trost

22
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,625
[NARRATOR] before disappearing.

23
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:38,458
[NARRATOR] The Titans flooded
in through the broken gate.

24
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:41,083
Eren! No!

25
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,083
[Armin screaming]

26
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,666
[NARRATOR] Two hours
later, the evacuation of

27
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,583
[NARRATOR] the entire
populace was complete.

28
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,833
[NARRATOR] As a result,

29
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:58,083
[NARRATOR] no civilians
were lost to the Titans.

30
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,875
[NARRATOR] The same cannot be
said for the countless soldiers

31
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,666
[NARRATOR] who perished,
buying the people time.

32
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,333
[MIKASA] Eren. As long
as you're part of my life,

33
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,250
[MIKASA] I can fight
to the bitter end.

34
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,958
[MALE SOLDIER]
Captain, please wait!

35
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,125
[MALE SOLDIER] There's only
a handful of us left, sir.

36
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,750
[MALE SOLDIER] If the Titans
were to attack here in force,

37
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,958
[MALE SOLDIER] we wouldn't
have a chance in hell

38
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,208
[MALE SOLDIER]
of holding them off!

39
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,458
[FEMALE SOLDIER] Please,
sir. We need you here!

40
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,625
Out of my way, soldier.
We have to get going.

41
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,833
My expertise is needed to
help direct the reinforcements.

42
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,291
Behind the safety of
the inner gate. Am I right?

43
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,625
Just what the hell
are you implying?

44
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,833
They need my
help reorganizing.

45
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,500
Or would you rather
us be overwhelmed

46
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,375
due to a logistical nightmare!

47
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,875
But-- But sir! If
we lose those supplies--

48
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,666
That's enough!

49
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,791
Question my orders again,
or delay me in my duties,

50
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,500
and I'll run your treasonous
hide straight through!

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,333
Why isn't anyone
going over the wall?

52
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,000
They must have heard
the withdrawal signal.

53
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:10,250
It's over.
All over. We're doomed.

54
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:14,416
[weeping]

55
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,875
[Titan growling]

56
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,458
[whimpering]

57
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,958
There!

58
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,208
[FEMALE SOLDIER] C'mon
now. That musket's

59
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,291
[FEMALE SOLDIER]
not enough to stop them.

60
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,666
[FEMALE SOLDIER] Huh?

61
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,541
[gun shot]

62
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:34,458
[screaming]

63
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,916
[CONNY] Hey, Jean.
What're we gonna do?

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,500
We can't do anything.

65
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,583
They finally gave us
the order to withdraw.

66
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,541
And we were all
out of gas, of course.

67
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,333
I can't believe this
is how it's going to end.

68
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,250
Because of those
damned cowards!

69
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:55,708
Y'mean the supply depot? What
is going on? Where are they?

70
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,375
They all lost
their will to fight.

71
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,500
And I can understand why.

72
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,125
[JEAN] But they abandoned
their duty to supply us,

73
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,541
[JEAN] barricading
themselves inside HQ.

74
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,625
[JEAN] And of course,
Titans have swarmed the place,

75
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,083
[JEAN] which means we
can't get the gas ourselves.

76
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,250
Then why're we
waitin'? We gotta go.

77
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,541
Start thinning their
numbers so we have a chance!

78
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,000
[CONNY] Sitting here on this
roof is totally pointless!

79
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,041
[CONNY] Eventually the
Titans are gonna come for us.

80
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,708
We don't have much gas left.

81
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,125
We'll just waste
what little we've got

82
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,500
if we try to run.
And without our mobility,

83
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,500
[CONNY] we're
completely screwed!

84
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,083
You're using your head
for once, Conny. Nice going.

85
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,375
But I'm just not sure if
we've got the numbers needed

86
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,750
to pull this thing
off. The veterans in

87
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,875
the Vanguard force
have all been killed.

88
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,000
[JEAN] How, exactly, do
a bunch of rookies pull off

89
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,416
[JEAN] a suicide
mission like this?

90
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,916
[JEAN] I mean, let's
assume half of our force

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,791
[JEAN] even survives
the initial assault.

92
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,583
[JEAN] Then what? The supply
room is probably crawling with

93
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,416
[JEAN] Titans in the
three or four meter range.

94
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,333
[JEAN] I don't see us
accomplishing much in there.

95
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,083
It's hopeless.

96
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,750
God, what a dull life
this turned out to be.

97
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,416
I never even got to
tell her just how I feel.

98
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,541
[SASHA] C'mon guys,
we can do it!

99
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,041
Right? Let's go.

100
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,958
If we all work together,
we can make this happen,

101
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,583
[SASHA] I know we can! All
right? I'll take the lead.

102
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,875
Armin! It's time to go.

103
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,916
[ANNIE] Reiner. Do we move out?

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,250
Not yet. We have to
let them gather up first.

105
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,458
[MARCO] It's no use.

106
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,666
There's too many of them.

107
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,416
I don't think any of us
are going to survive this.

108
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,583
I've come to accept
my pending demise.

109
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:01,500
[MARCO] I just... wanted
my death to mean something.

110
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,166
[CADET] Mikasa! Weren't
you with the rearguard?

111
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,458
[MIKASA] Annie!

112
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,375
I know how bad things
have gotten. It's selfish.

113
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,666
Putting personal
matters in the forefront,

114
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,791
but have you
seen Eren's squad?

115
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,208
Some squads made it back.
But I don't know about Eren's.

116
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,291
We found Armin,
he's over there.

117
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,833
[MIKASA] Armin!

118
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:29,791
Mikasa! I can't. How do I
tell her what happened to Eren?

119
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,583
I survived, and
it means nothing.

120
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,458
I'm so useless!

121
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,125
[ARMIN] I wish I had
died with him instead!

122
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,916
Armin. Are you okay?
You're not hurt, are you?

123
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,458
Where is Eren?

124
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,916
[MIKASA] Armin?

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,666
[Armin crying]

126
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:15,541
[ARMIN] They were-- The cadets
of Squad 34. Thomas Wagner.

127
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:22,750
[ARMIN] Nack Tierce. Milieus
Zeremski. Mina Carolina.

128
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,083
[ARMIN] Eren Jaeger!

129
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,000
[ARMIN] These brave
five upheld their duties.

130
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:34,083
[ARMIN] They died valiantly
on the field of battle!

131
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,416
[Armin weeping]

132
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,166
Please, no.

133
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,166
[CADET 1] His whole
squad was wiped out?

134
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,875
[CADET 2] The same
will happen to us

135
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,708
[CADET 2] if we try
to take on those Titans.

136
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,833
[weeping]
I'm so sorry, Mikasa!

137
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,416
It should have been
me that died, not Eren!

138
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,083
I-- I couldn't do a
thing! I'm worthless.

139
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,375
[MIKASA] Armin.

140
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,666
Calm yourself.
We haven't got time

141
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,291
for you to get
emotional right now.

142
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,750
Huh?

143
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,375
[MIKASA] On your feet.

144
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,625
[MIKASA] Marco. If we eliminate
or bypass the Titans at HQ,

145
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,041
we can there refuel
our gear, allowing us to

146
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,833
get back over the wall.
Is that assessment correct?

147
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,791
Well-- Uh yeah I guess so,
sure. But there's just too many

148
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,083
of them out there.
Even with you on point.

149
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,500
I can do it.

150
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,833
What?

151
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,625
I'm strong. Real strong.

152
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,208
[MIKASA] None of you
come close. You hear me?

153
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,625
[MIKASA] I am a warrior.

154
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,875
Know this. I
have the power to slay

155
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,375
all of the Titans
that block our path!

156
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,208
Even if I
have to do it alone.

157
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,333
[MIKASA] As far as I'm
concerned, I am surrounded by

158
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:56,041
[MIKASA] a bunch of
unskilled, cowardly worms.

159
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,000
[MIKASA] You dissappoint
me. You can just sit here

160
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,583
[MIKASA] and twiddle your
thumbs, and watch how it's done!

161
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,875
Wait, Mikasa. Are you out
of your mind? That's crazy!

162
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,041
You can't be serious! Trying
to take them out by yourself?

163
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,833
There's no way you
can hope to beat them!

164
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:15,583
If I can't beat them, then
I die. But, if I win, I live.

165
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,291
And the only way
to win is to fight!

166
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,458
[MARCO] Hey!

167
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,541
You know, I was expecting
something more motivational.
