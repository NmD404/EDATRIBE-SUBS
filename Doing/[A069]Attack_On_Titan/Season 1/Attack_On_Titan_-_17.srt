[REINER] Nice ass for an
Abnormal, you gotta admit.

175
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,750
[ARMIN] It's not an Abnormal.

176
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,083
[ARMIN] It's a person
controlling a Titan body.

177
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,458
Wait. What?

178
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,208
I'll explain in a second.
We need to fire off

179
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,541
a signal to
warn the others!

180
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,041
[ARMIN] Come on! Work
you piece of garbage!

181
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,083

like Jean's got you covered.

183
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,208
[REINER] Oh man, that's not
good. The right-wing spotters

184
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,541
[REINER] have suffered too
many causalities to carry on!

185
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,875
Yeah, apparently
most of them were

186
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,666
wiped out by a Titan ambush.

187
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,708
I don't know how it
happened, but it was bad.

188
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,916
Sons-a-bitches
were lighting-fast.

189
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,958
[JEAN] The spotters
didn't have time to react.

190
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,750
[JEAN] Whoever's left is
trying to hold them off,

191
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,291
[JEAN] but that means now
there's no one on lookout duty.

192
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,125
[JEAN] Talk about
a setback, right?

193
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,208
[JEAN] If we don't
watch ourselves,

194
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,500
[JEAN] we're all
gonna get wiped out.

195
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,041
Wait. She came
from that direction.

196
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,458
Does that mean--

197
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,875
Could she have led the
Titans here like a commander?

198
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,416
Who, her?

199
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,625
[JEAN] Why the hell's she
running from us, by the way?

200
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,041
Is she an Abnormal?

201
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,666
No, she's isn't. I still
don't know how it's possible,

202
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,916
but she's another human
who's taken Titan form.

203
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,250
Someone who has
the same power as Eren.

204
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,958
Please say you're not serious.

205
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,750
Really? Why
do you think that?

206
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,250
Titans eat people,
but they're not murderers.

207
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,875
Sure, they kill
us in the process,

208
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,208
but that's not their intent;

209
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,250
they just feed on
instinct like any creature.

210
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,333
This one was different. When
the others went for her nape,

211
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,375
[ARMIN] she struck
them down in cold blood.

212
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,458
[ARMIN]
Swatted them like flies.

213
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,750
[ARMIN] She didn't eat them;
she killed them and moved on.

214
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,916
[ARMIN] That's out of character,
even for an Abnormal.

215
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,958
The Titans that
took out the right-wing?

216
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,583
I think she
brought them here.

217
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,541
Just like the Colossal and
the Armored when they struck.

218
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,291
I just know it.

219
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,125
She's not simply
satisfying bloodlust.

220
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,916
She has it in for us.

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,125
Or perhaps
more specifically,

222
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,166
I think she's actually
after someone in particular.

223
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,125
At which point the question
becomes who and why?

224
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,541
Hey, wait a second,
could it be Eren?

225
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,541
[REINER] Eren?
He's with Levi Squad.

226
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,875
[REINER] They're spearheading
the right-wing. Or, they were.

227
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,041
Wait. Levi's team?

228
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,958
I'm pretty sure you're
wrong there, big guy.

229
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,875
My copy of the plan
had them in the left wing.

230
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,875
That's odd, because my
copy of the plan had them

231
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,333
at the front of
the right-wing, too,

232
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,541
which now that I think
about it doesn't make sense.

233
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,916
Putting them at
the vanguard like that

234
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,791
wouldn't be
smart strategically.

235
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,875
Then where exactly
are they supposed to be?

236
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,458
Come on, where else? The safest
position in the formation.

237
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:06,750
Which, I assume, at least, would
be rear of the center rank.

238
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,416
[LEVI] Armin!
Now's not the time to be

tails about this!

240
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,166
We've got to get word out
how dangerous this one is;

241
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,333
smoke signals
aren't gonna cut it!

242
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,625
[JEAN] At this rate, she'll
cut down the command squad!

243
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,875
[JEAN] We let that happen,
the formation goes to hell

244
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,041

245
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,750
[REINER] You have a plan?

246
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,875
More of a wing and a prayer.
Look, we've got to try

247
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,416
and distract her so the
platoon has a chance to retreat.

248
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,000
If we're careful,
from this distance

249
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,166
we should be able to manage it.

250
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,916
And make it out alive.

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,875
Well, maybe anyway.

252
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,208
She's smarter than the
ones we usually deal with.

253
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,458
You can take my word for
it. From her perspective

254
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,000
we're little
more than insects.

255
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,500

and we're all flattened.

339
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,041
[Jean shocked]

340
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:36,416
[JEAN] No! Reiner. Oh, god.

341
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,875
[Reiner warcry]

342
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,000
[JEAN] That beautiful bastard!

343
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,791
[JEAN] Mikasa's been hogging
so much of the limelight

344
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,541
[JEAN] these days,
I'd let myself forget

345
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,875
[JEAN] how much
of a badass he is.

346
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,375
Odds are that bought the
platoon more than enough time.

347
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,791
I say we follow suit
and get outta here!

348
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,791
[REINER] If she
doesn't have an appetite

349
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,125
[REINER] for
people like you say,

350
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,291
[REINER] I'm guessin'
she's not gonna follow us.

351
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,166
Alright! Looks
like she's in retreat!

352
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,250
Poor thing's running home
with her tail between her legs!

353
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,666
[ARMIN] What? Wait. No.

354
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,583
[ARMIN] She's headed
for the center rank.

355
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:33,500
[ARMIN] She's--
She's going for Eren!

356
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,500
[NARRATOR] The monster advances.

357
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,958
[NARRATOR] Even
the Scout Regiment,

358
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,625
[NARRATOR] for all
its training and skill,

359
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,333
[NARRATOR] cannot bring
its newest foe to heel.

360
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:19,416
[NARRATOR] Until at last,
in a forest of giant trees,

361
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,791
[NARRATOR] she catches
sight of her goal.
