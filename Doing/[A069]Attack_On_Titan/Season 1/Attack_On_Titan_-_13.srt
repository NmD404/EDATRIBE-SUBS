[PYXIS] Having assumed
Titan form, Cadet Jaeger will

12
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,916
[PYXIS] hoist said
boulder on his back,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,166
[PYXIS] schlep it to
the hole, and voila!

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,250
[PYXIS] And this is
where you all come in.

15
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,000
[PYXIS] Your job will
be to defend him. Yes.

16

against his own kind.

21
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,250

insignificant plot of land

22
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,875
[PYXIS] compared
to the vast tracts of

23
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,083

long abandoned.

24
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,666

00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,333
Oh my god. The
mission was a success!

175
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,041
Deploy all reinforcements.

176
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,250
[PYXIS] Bring
the Elite Squad home.

177
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,125
[RICO] Mind the stragglers!

178
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,291
Ackerman! Pull back!

179
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,250
With all due respect,
I'm not withdrawing

180
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,250
until I recover Eren!

181
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,250
[MIKASA] Armin! How is he?

182
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,125
[ARMIN] Unconscious and
scorching to the touch!

183
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,583
There we go.

184
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,000
[ARMIN] We have to
get him up the wall!

185
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,375
Uh oh, damn it.
He's fused to the carcass!

186
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,166
I can't work him free!

187
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,541
[RICO] Then we cut.

188
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,375
Wait! We don't know
what that might do!

189
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,041
Eren! Armin!

Mikasa!

Who's that?

194
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:06,083
[EREN] The wings... of freedom.

195
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,166
Pay attention, kiddos.

196
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,708
[LEVI] This is the part
where you explain to me

197
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,291
[LEVI] exactly what
it is I'm looking at.

198
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,000
[NARRATOR] Afterward, thanks
to the coordinated efforts of

199
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,416
[NARRATOR]
the Scout Regiment and

200
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,708
[NARRATOR] the Garrison
Regiment's Corps of Engineers,

201
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,791
[NARRATOR] Wall Rose
once against stood as

202
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,375
[NARRATOR] a bulwark
against the Titan hordes.

203
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,833
[NARRATOR] It was a full day's
work dispatching the Titans

204
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,375
[NARRATOR] who
remained corralled within

205
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,791
[NARRATOR] Trost's
perimeter, during which

206
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,166
[NARRATOR] the wall-mounted
cannons fired ceaselessly.

207
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,500
[NARRATOR] Most of the
Titans nearest the wall

208
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,291
[NARRATOR] were wiped
out by explosive shells.

209
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,083
[NARRATOR] The few that remained
once the smoked cleared were

210
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,083
[NARRATOR] summarily cut
down by the Scout Regiment.

211
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,333
[NARRATOR] During the so-called
cleanup operation, two Titans,

212
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,750
[NARRATOR] a 4-meter and
a 7-meter, were captured

213
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,083
[NARRATOR] alive and
successfully restrained.

214
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,750
[NARRATOR] However...

215
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,750
[NARRATOR] All told, 207 people
were either dead or missing.

216
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,125
[NARRATOR] 897 were
counted among the injured.

217
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,916
[NARRATOR] So while
the reclamation of Trost

218
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,750
[NARRATOR] represented the
first true victory for humanity

219
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,708
[NARRATOR] in its
fight against the Titans,

220
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,416
[NARRATOR] too many
soldiers had fallen

221
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,875
[NARRATOR] for
celebration to be in order.

222
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,375
[JEAN] I-Is--

223
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,625
[JEAN] Is that... Marco?

224
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,416
[DOCTOR] If you have
a name for this one,

225
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,208
[DOCTOR] it'd be
helpful to pass it along.

226
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,958
[JEAN] I wondered where he was.

227
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:15,541
But he's-- He's not the
sort of guy... who, you know--

228
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:20,000
Marco. What happened?

229
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,291
[JEAN] No. Somebody
saw it. Had to've.

230
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,000
[JEAN] Somebody
knows how he went out.

231
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,500
[DOCTOR] I need his name.
We don't have time for this.

232
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,541
Please, son. You understand?

233
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,250
It's been two
days since we bored up

234
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,750
the hole in Wall
Rose. That's too long.

235
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,083
We're nowhere near
accounting for all the dead.

236
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,166
Unless these poor
souls are dealt with soon,

237
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,541
an epidemic is
likely to break out.

238
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,791
[DOCTOR] We're the
first line of defense

239
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,000
[DOCTOR] against
secondary disaster.

240
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,083
[DOCTOR] We'll lament the fallen
after we've done our jobs.

241
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,208
Is that understood?

242
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,875
[JEAN] He was a member
of the 104th Cadet Corps,

243
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:07,000
[JEAN] captain of
Squad 19. Marco Bodt.

244
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,625
Bodt. Duly noted, then.

245
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,458
Thank you, cadet.
I appreciate the help.

246
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,916
Continue.

247
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:27,000
[SASHA] Wha--
What is this thing?

248
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,375
Leftover Titan vomit.

249
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,291
[ELITE A] Apparently they
don't have a digestive tract,

250
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,333
[ELITE A] so once they've
had their fill of people,

251
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,291
[ELITE A] they upchuck
them like hairballs.

252
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,208
That's sick.

253
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:43,916
Ugh. So gross. Can't
even make out a face.

254
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,208
[ANNIE] I'm sorry.

255
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,750
I'm sorry, I...

256
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,958
Contrition does them no good.

257
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,208
What they need
is a proper burial.

258
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,708
[MAN] Any questions?

259
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,000
[EREN] That's Commander Erwin,

260
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,416
[EREN] head of the Scout
Regiment's Task Force.

261
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,458
[EREN] What's he doing
here? And Captain Levi?

262
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,166
Uh... I, uh--

263
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,541
[EREN] Where...

264
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,500
[EREN] Where am I?

265
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:54,000
[ERWIN] I think it's obvious.
Let's just call it a dungeon.

266
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,958
[ERWIN] You're currently in the
custody of the Military Police.

267
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,166
[ERWIN] We were
granted permission to

268
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,666
[ERWIN] see you only just now.

269
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,583
[chains rattling]

270
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,375
Where'd you get that?

271
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:10,000
[ERWIN] Off of you. Don't
worry, you'll get it back.

272
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,375
Let's talk home.

273
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,583
Specifically the good doctor's
cellar back in Shiganshina.

274
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,083
Pretty big secret
in there, right?

275
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,708
[ERWIN] About the Titans?

276
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:24,291
Yeah. I think so.
That's what Dad said anyway.

277
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,541
Must suck having your
dad and your memory

278
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,666
MIA at the same time.

279
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,416
Unless, of course,
that's just a cover story.

280
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,375
Enough. We've been
over this already.

281
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,250
We know he has
no reason to lie.

282
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,375
And that's all we know.

283
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,166
How 'bout you shed a little
light on things for me

284
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,041
by telling us your intentions.

285
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,708
M-- My what?
What do you mean?

286
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,291
[ERWIN] Here's the lay
of the land, my friend.

287
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,166
[ERWIN] If we want to pay
your dad's cellar a visit,

288
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,166
[ERWIN] we have to venture
back into Shiganshina.

289
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,375
[ERWIN] Sealing the breach there
as we did in Trost would be

290
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,000
[ERWIN] the smart way to
go about it, don't you think?

291
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,291
[ERWIN] Naturally, we'll
need your special powers.

292
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:08,750
[ERWIN] Any way you slice it,
a Titan's deciding our fate.

293
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,625
[ERWIN] It's been
conjectured that the Colossal

294
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,208
[ERWN] and the Armored Titan

295
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,500
[ERWIN] are more or
less the same as you.

296
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,250
It's why I ask your intentions.

297
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,208
They could be the key to
turning the tide forever.

298
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,375
[ERWIN] You could save us.

299
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,416
I don't know what I am.

300
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:33,458
[EREN TITAN] No. This is over.

301
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,250
[EREN TITAN] I'm going
to put a stop to this!

302
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,250
[EREN] I'll kill them
with my bare hands!

303
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,375
[LEVI] C'mon. It's an easy
question. So answer it.

304
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,208
What the hell
is it you wanna do?

305
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,291
I want to become a
member of the Scouts

306
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,708
and slaughter every
Titan that crosses my path!

307
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,708
Huh. Well played.

308
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:08,458
[LEVI] Alright, then. I'll
take responsibility for him.

309
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,250
[LEVI] Let the higher-ups
know what's going on.

310
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,583
Not that I implicitly
trust him, of course.

311
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,458
It's more a matter
of me trusting myself

312
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,708
to deal with him.

313
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,791
Kill him, if I have to.

314
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,208
The big wigs aren't
likely to raise a stink.

315
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,541
My record more than speaks
for itself, I'm pretty sure.

316
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,166
[LEVI] Good news, Jaeger.

317
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,208
[LEVI] You're now officially
a member of the Scouts.

318
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,708
[NARRATOR]
A special court marshal.

319
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,000
[NARRATOR] Eren is released
from his underground cell

320
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,125
[NARRATOR] only to be
dragged before a tribunal of

321
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,791
[NARRATOR] the military's
highest ranking officials.

322
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,500
[NARRATOR] The
issue being decided?

323
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,916
[NARRATOR] Whether
he lives or dies.
