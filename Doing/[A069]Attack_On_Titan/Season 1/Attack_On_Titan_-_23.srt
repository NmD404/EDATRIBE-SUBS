1
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,958
[MAN] That's good, Annie.

2
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,791
I expect the
best from my daughter.

3
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,750
[heavy breathing]

4
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,833
[ANNIE'S DAD] Move! Who
told you it was time to rest?

5
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,208
[MAN] Hold on. You
mean you haven't heard?

6
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,458
[MAN] The Titan kid and
those big shot handlers of his

7
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,291
[MAN] have been
summoned to the capital.

8
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,500
Which means they'll be
passing through here today.

9
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,791
Is that so? Well then
maybe this time they'll just

10
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,750
dissect him and
get it over with.

11
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,875
[MAN] I just hope he
doesn't stir up any trouble.

12
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,375
[MAN] I say
let him pass through

13
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,708
[MAN] and seal the
gate shut behind him!

14
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:44,333
Infidel! To even
suggest sealing the gate!

15
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,666
The hands of
heretics must never

16
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,250
taint the sanctity
of our Walls!

17
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,458
[MAN] Maria! Rose! Sina!

18
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,000
To even think of defiling
the three goddesses.

19
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,583
We tempt the
specter of damnation!

20
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,208
These lunatics
all worship the Walls

21
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,875
as if they're
some kind of gods.

22
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,125
It creeps me out.

23
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,125
Damn cult. Can't believe
they're still around.

24
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,666
Let's go.

25
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,583
Look who's finally awake!

26
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,750
[HITCH] You look so
terrifying when you're asleep

27
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,375
[HITCH] I didn't
dare disturb you.

28
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,375
Prob'ly should've. Sorry.

29
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,208
You've been pretty lax
in your duties, recently.

30
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,250
[HITCH] Look, Marlo.
You've upset her.

31
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,875
[MARLO] She's
antisocial, not upset.

32
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,791
Knock it off, you guys. She
fought in the Battle of Trost

33
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,541
before coming here. Which
makes her the only one of us

34
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,750
who's ever seen
any real action.

35
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,583
[BORIS] She's just
been through hell.

36
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,333
[BORIS] Probably
takes time to readjust.

37
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,291
[HITCH] Ah! So. You have a
crush on the new girl, huh?

38
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,500
[Hitch chuckling]

39
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,625
[HITCH] What could you
possibly see in her?

40
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,000
[MARLO] I dunno, Hitch. Maybe
it's that she got into the MP's

41
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,458
[MARLO] based on skill,
unlike some I could mention.

42
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,166
[HITCH] Oh. I don't know
what you're implying.

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,750
[HITCH] Why don't you clarify?

44
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,250
[BORIS] That's enough, you two.

45
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,041
[DENNIS] Great. Thanks,
guys. I called you all here

46
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,916
[DENNIS] 'cause I've got
actual work for you today.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,041
Not just the same ol' crap.

48
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,208
It's got somethin'
to do with the Scouts

49
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,250
being summoned to the capital.

50
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,833
Sometime today, they'll
be passing through town

51
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,541
along the main street.

52
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,166
[DENNIS] HQ has already provided
a security detail, so we're

53
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,083
[DENNIS] only being asked to
assist until the convoy's clear.

54
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,875
[DENNIS] ODM use in city
limits has been authorized.

55
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,541
[DENNIS] You'll follow
beside the convoy,

56
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,375
[DENNIS] as additional security.

57
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,666
[DENNIS] There's a
barge waiting to take you

58
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,458
[DENNIS] to the starting
point. Dismissed.

59
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,250
Sir! A question, if I may.

60
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,125
[DENNIS] Hmm? Go ahead.

61
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,541
What exactly are
we supposed to be

62
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,666
protecting this
convoy from, sir?

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,166
Hmm?

64
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,583
It's just that I've
never heard of anyone

65
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,958
defying the government.
They're just glad to be safe.

66
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,166
There are
petty criminals, sure.

67
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,875
But I find it hard to imagine
any actual organization

68
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,875
existing within the wall
that would attempt a strike.

69
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,958
I mean, what possible
motive would they have?

70
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:13,083
Man! Aren't you serious?
You can be in charge of this.

71
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,416
[DENNIS] Everything you need
to know is right in here.

72
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,333
Uh... Huh?

73
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,666
We officers are
busy enough as it is.

74
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,458
Prove that you can
handle this one yourselves.

75
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,541
[DENNIS] Oh, and you better
not screw it up, got it?

76
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,416
[DENNIS] Hey, sorry 'bout
that. Back to business.

77
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,458
[DENNIS] Who's turn was it?

78
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,583
[MARLO] Damn. This stinks!

79
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,208
Got that right. The amount
of slacking that goes on

80
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,666
in this outfit is
even more than I imagined.

81
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,666
I mean, that is why I
chose to join, but still.

82
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,500
I might've thought twice
if I'd known that meant

83
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,458
the rookies got stuck doing
all the work all the time.

84
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,125
Seriously. Wish someone
would've warned me.

85
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,166
Bastards. They're
all irresponsible,

86
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,791
self absorbed
imbeciles! All of them!

87
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,250
Hmm. So what's
that make you, Marlo?

88
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,416
You chose to join
the Military Police.

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,083
You're a slacker just
like the rest of us.

90
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,791
You're wrong, Boris.

91
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,625
I'm nothing like the
rest of you degenerates!

92
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,458
[MARLO] I joined up
because the Military Police

93
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,083
[MARLO] is in
dire need of repair!

94
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,875
[Hitch clapping]

95
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,291
Wow. That was great, Marlo!

96
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,500
I never pegged you
for the crusader type!

97
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,625
Just how do
you plan to fix it?

98
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,208
By working my way
to the top, of course.

99
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,958
And then once I'm in charge.
I can install a new system

100
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,833
to make sure all
those who are dishonest

101
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:36,083
pay for their transgressions.
It's as simple as that.

102
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,541
The MPs just need a little
discipline, and nothing more.

103
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,916
[MARLO] I'll shape
them back into the people

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,375
[MARLO] they're supposed to be.

105
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,833
[Hitch laughing]

106
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,500
[HITCH] Wow. That is something!

107
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,291
[HITCH] And I thought you
were a total buzzkill before!

108
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,750
Well, that's a
rather lofty ideal.

109
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,625
So, y'know, good
luck with all that.

110
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,375
[ANNIE] What's the point?

111
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,875
I think if a do-gooder like you

112
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,916
was actually put in
charge of this regiment,

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,583
you'd quickly find
yourself working alone.

114
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,500
Really? That's the first thing
you open your mouth to say?

115
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,750
[ANNIE] Don't get me wrong,
I don't doubt your sincerity.

116
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,250
[ANNIE] I know conviction
when I see it.

117
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,833
[ANNIE] You're not
the first person I've met

118
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,583
[ANNIE] who thought they
could take on the world

119
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,333
[ANNIE] and change
things for the better.

120
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,125
[ANNIE] It takes a lot of
courage to go against the flow.

121
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,583
[ANNIE] I respect that.

122
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,208
[ANNIE] Of course, it
could be that you're all

123
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,208
[ANNIE] just a bunch of fools.

124
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,666
They might be, but don't
go lumping me in with them!

125
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,041
[MARLO] Is that understood?

126
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,208
[MARLO] Bah! Enough
chit-chat. Let's go!

127
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,750
[MARLO] The escort wagons
are scheduled to pass through

128
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,958
[MARLO] the outer gate
in forty five minutes.

129
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:52,125
[MARLO] Once we arrive, everyone
take up your positions. Got it?

130
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,791
[HITCH] Yeah, yeah.

131
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,541
Hey! Watch it, bud!

132
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,625
[HITCH] What's goin'
on? That's our gear.

133
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,416
Shipping it to the Interior?

134
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,416
Isn't it a bit strange,
having the Merchant's Guild

135
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,333
conduct the transport?

136
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,333
[MARLO] What're they up to?

137
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,416
Are those bastards illegally
selling government property?

138
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,583
Hey, this isn't
our assignment!

139
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,541
Look at him! Crusader-man's
the genuine article!

140
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,333
Well, I suppose we
have the time to spare.

141
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,583
I bet this'll be entertaining.

142
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,875
I'd say we've earned
ourselves a drink!

143
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,625
Hmm?

144
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,750
What do you think you're
lookin' at? Huh, rookie?

145
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,833
You-- You can't sell
government equipment.

146
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,041
It's against the law!

147
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,708
Is that so?

148
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,250
Those supplies are the property
of the hard-working citizens

149
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,666
who pay for
them with their taxes.

150
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,666
[MARLO] And that means--

151
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,250
[MP laughing]

152
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,750
Can you believe this business?

153
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,625
A rookie blackmailing
his superior officers!

154
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,958
[MP] I'm thinkin' you got a
bright future ahead of you, kid.

155
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:20,291
Go spend it on a girl, alright?
She'll help you unwind.

156
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,458
Wait. Hey!

157
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,333
What you did
was against the law!

158
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,000
[Marlo coughing]

159
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:49,750
[grunts and gasps]

160
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,500
Hey wait!

161
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,500
[chuckling]

162
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,625
You're under arrest
for a treasonable offense

163
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,958
against an officer.

164
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,291
[MARLO] Blatant disregard
for the rule of law--

165
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,708
[MP] Is standard
procedure! So is this!

166
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,416
[ANNIE] He's had enough.
Don't you think, sir?

167
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,416
[HITCH] So sorry
about that fellas!

168
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,250
I hope our idiot hasn't
caused you too much trouble.

169
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,750
[HITCH] We'll be sure
to drive the lesson home,

170
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,291
[HITCH] don't you worry!

171
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,500
Unless, of course...
you'd rather have...

172
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,666
[HITCH] a much bigger
problem on your hands.

173
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,666
[clears throat]

174
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,333
Just this once.

175
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,791
[ALL] Sir!

176
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,958
[MP 1] So, about that drink.

177
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,375
[MP 2] Yeah. I worked
up quite the thirst!

178
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,666
[ANNIE] Go ahead.

179
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,083
[ANNIE] Aren't you going
to "make the dishonest

180
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,583
[ANNIE] pay for
their transgressions"?

181
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:04,375
[ANNIE] I'm not entirely opposed
to helping you out with that.

182
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,666
[MP] Is it me, or do
those serving gals

183
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,708
[MP] get prettier
with every sip?

184
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,333
[MARLO] Damn it!

185
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,083
[MP] Hey, little lady! You
workin' hard? Or hardly working?

186
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,041
[WOMAN] You boys are
all the same! [giggles]

187
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,250
[MARLO] Those people you know.

188
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,083
[MARLO] The other
"fools" you mentioned.

189
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,000
[MARLO] Would
they have done it?

190
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,791
They might've.

191
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:49,333
[MARLO] I wanted to be brave.
To go against the flow.

192
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,583
[MARLO] But when it comes
down to it, I'm just another

193
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,458
[MARLO] piece of scum being
swept away by the current.

194
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,833
[ANNIE] Not sure
what to say about that.

195
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,208
Maybe... that's just a part of
what it means to be ordinary.

196
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,375
[ANNIE] Simply
going with the flow.

197
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,666
Is that so bad? To some
people it makes you weak,

198
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,500
[ANNIE] but an ordinary
person is all I want to be.

199
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:32,333
[horses trotting]

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,416
[MAN] Annie!

201
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,541
Hello.

202
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:54,208
[ARMIN] So, you're
a full-fledged MP now.

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,708
[ANNIE] Armin.

204
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,791
[ANNIE] So, uh.
What's with the outfit?

205
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,791
Why I'm in the
rain gear, you mean?

206
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,583
It's a makeshift disguise.

207
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,916
Needed to conceal
my ODM rig. See?

208
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,375
What's this about?

209
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,583
Annie. We have a
plan for Eren to escape,

210
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,583
and we're hoping
that you'll help us.

211
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,458
[ANNIE] Wait, escape to where?
Stuck behind these walls,

212
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,208
[ANNIE] where can you possibly
hide that they won't find you?

213
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,583
[ARMIN] We'll only need to
hide him for a short while.

214
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,833
[ARMIN] This isn't a mutiny.

215
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,958
[ARMIN] We have every
intention of returning.

216
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,083
View this as a few
loyal Scouts staging

217
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,333
a small act of protest.
It's a stall tactic.

218
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,625
We need time to gather
enough evidence to overrun

219
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,625
the council's ruling about
Eren. That's all we want.

220
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,041
You're serious about this?

221
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,083
How can you be so
sure the evidence exists?

222
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,833
And what is it?

223
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,916
I can't say. I'm sorry.

224
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,500
[sigh]

225
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,708
[ANNIE] Sorry, Armin.
I'm gonna have to decline.

226
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,958
[ANNIE] My lips are sealed,
though. Best of luck.

227
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,541
Hold on! Annie, please!

228
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,041
They're going to kill Eren!

229
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,041
[ARMIN] They'll kill him for
no better reason than that

230
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,875
[ARMIN] they fear what
they don't understand.

231
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,208
They don't see
that their fear is

232
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,458
pushing humanity to
the brink of extinction!

233
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,708
Maybe it's too late
to change their minds.

234
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,250
[ANNIE] But what if we can?
We have no choice but

235
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,250
[ANNIE] to bet
everything on that chance!

236
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,833
I'm sorry. The last thing
we want is to cause you grief.

237
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,250
But, well. The only
way to sneak him through

238
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,875
the Wall Sina checkpoints
is with the help of

239
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,375
someone in the Military Police!

240
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,000
[ARMIN] It's our only hope.

241
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,875
But why me? Do
I really look like

242
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,541
that good of a person to you?

243
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,958
A good person? I dunno.

244
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:05,041
Actually, I've never placed much
value in those sorts of labels.

245
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,166
[ARMIN] The way I see it,
"good" is merely a word

246
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,541
[ARMIN] applied to people who
are convenient to our needs

247
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,500
in some way. It's
purely subjective.

248
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,375
Any way you try to look at it,

249
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,958
labeling people
dehumanizes them.

250
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:22,166
Regardless, if you still choose
to say "no" to this request,

251
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,958
then at least in my eyes
that makes you a bad person.

252
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,416
[ANNIE] Alright.

253
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,125
[ANNIE] Let's go.

254
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,833
We made it. Can't
believe it was so easy.

255
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,041
Hush!

256
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,791
The Military Police,
hard at work.

257
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,333
I'm almost surprised they
bothered to show up at all.

258
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,791
Let's just keep moving.

259
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,375
[EREN] Hopefully they haven't
noticed my stand-in yet, either.

260
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,250
[EREN] It's not gonna hold
up under close scrutiny.

261
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,750
After all, Jean and
I look nothing alike.

262
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,000
It's close enough. You both
have that same angry scowl,

263
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,250
and the same boulder-sized
chip on your shoulder.

264
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,333
Well, yeah! But I don't
have his horse face!

265
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,333
Hey. So if I had refused
to help you guys out,

266
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,083
then what was your Plan B
for getting over the wall?

267
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,666
We would've used our ODM gear

268
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,666
to barge right
through the checkpoint.

269
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,041
That's stupid. Why
didn't you just avoid

270
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,125
all this trouble
in the first place?

271
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,250
You could've escaped before
reaching Stohess, right?

272
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,750
[ANNIE] I mean,
why wait 'til now?

273
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,791
[ARMIN] I felt that this town's
complex layout would allow us

274
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,333
[ARMIN] to squeeze a
bit more time out of

275
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,208
[ARMIN] our body-double ploy.

276
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,208
Of course. A head-on
assault is ill-advised.

277
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,333
So as long as the convoy acts
like it's following orders.

278
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,958
Then everyone keeps
their defenses down.

279
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,583
I see. It's a very good plan.

280
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,250
[ARMIN] Ah! There it is!

281
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,000
[ANNIE] Here?

282
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,916
[ARMIN] Yeah. We'll
pass through here.

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,875
[ARMIN] It's what remains of
an underground city they were

284
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,291
[ARMIN] planning to
build way back when.

285
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,250
[ARMIN] And if I'm right,
it should lead us

286
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,000
to the vicinity
of the outer gate.

287
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,833
Nice work,
Armin. That's amazing

288
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,583
[EREN] Annie?

289
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,333
[EREN] What's the matter?
You're not afraid of dark,

290
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,083
cramped spaces
or anything, are you?

291
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,416
So what? So what if I am?

292
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,083
I wouldn't expect a suicidal
maniac like you to understand.

293
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,333
You don't know what it is

294
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,625
to be an ordinary
girl, crippled with fear.

295
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,750
A girl who can flip a
full-grown man upside down

296
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,958
has nothing to
fear from the dark.

297
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,666
Cut the crap and let's move!

298
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,916
[ANNIE] No. I refuse.

299
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,791
I'm too afraid.
Above ground, I'll help.

300
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,083
Otherwise the deal's off.

301
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,875
Quit being stubborn, dammit!
Just get the hell down here!

302
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,625
Move! We're running
out of time, alright?

303
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,333
Stop shouting.
Someone will hear you.

304
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,583
[ANNIE] I'm sure
it's fine, Mikasa.

305
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,125
It seems that,
for whatever reason,

306
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:46,416
this place has
been completely deserted.

307
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,416
That hurts me. It really does.

308
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,916
[ANNIE] The way you're
looking at me now.

309
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,791
[ANNIE] If I didn't know better,
I'd say you didn't trust me.

310
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,166
[ANNIE] Eh, Armin?

311
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,250
Annie. Tell me.

312
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,750
[ARMIN] What were you doing
with Marco's ODM gear?

313
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,958
[ARMIN] It had all the
same dents and scrapes.

314
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,416
[ARMIN] See, I helped
him with maintenance,

315
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,875
[ARMIN] so, I know you used it.

316
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:33,166
[ANNIE] Yes. I found it.
Found it and took it.

317
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,083
[worried breath]

318
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,666
[ARMIN] Then the two
Titans we had in custody.

319
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,625
It was you that killed them.

320
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,541
No one knows.

321
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,250
But if you suspected
all of this a month ago,

322
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,625
why did you wait this
long to say anything?

323
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,083
Because even
now it's difficult.

324
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,458
I just didn't want--
I didn't want to believe

325
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:56,083
that I was right.
So I stayed quiet.

326
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,125
But then, out in the field.

327
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,291
[ARMIN] The fact that you
didn't kill me then and there.

328
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,375
[ARMIN] That's the moment
that set us on the path

329
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,875
[ARMIN] to our
current situation.

330
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,583
Yes. We're here
'cause I let you live.

331
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,500
Of course, I never
would've dreamed you'd

332
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,791
end up cornering
in on me like this.

333
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:34,166
[ANNIE] Why? Why didn't
I do anything then?

334
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,375
Annie, please! You've
taken this joke far enough.

335
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,666
Just tell us this is some
kinda horrible prank.

336
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,041
It's not too late!

337
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,125
Come on! We'll understand!

338
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,041
Come down, lets talk.

339
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,666
You can prove to
us that we're mistaken

340
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,208
by walking down these stairs!

341
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,375
Prove we're
wrong to accuse you!

342
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,833
[ANNIE] We both know I
can't. Like I told you,

343
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,750
I don't have the
constitution for it.

344
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,083
Annie, stop!

345
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,833
We're talking about a
matter of life and death!

346
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,000
Work with us, Annie!

347
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,375
We can reason this
out like human beings.

348
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,875
[MIKASA] Enough.

349
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,375
[MIKASA] I'm not listening
to another word of this.

350
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,958
No point.

351
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,125
[MIKASA] I'm going
to carve you up again!

352
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,416
Do you understand me, Titan?

353
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,083
[chuckling]

354
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:38,125
[Annie laughing]

355
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,750
[ANNIE] You know, Armin.
It's nice that I could be

356
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,291
[ANNIE]
a "good person" for you.

357
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,958
[ANNIE] For now, at least, it
looks like you won your bet.

358
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,083
[ANNIE] But--

359
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:59,166
I'm going to gamble, too.
And here's my wager!

360
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,500
[MIKASA] Eren!

361
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,333
[Mikasa gasp]

362
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:19,958
What're you--?

363
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,416
It's too late.

364
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:29,000
[screaming]

365
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,041
[NARRATOR] The identity
of the Female Titan

366
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,458
[NARRATOR] has been discovered.

367
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,875
[NARRATOR] All along,
it was Annie Leonhart.

368
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,958
[NARRATOR] However, even when
faced with irrefutable truth,

369
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,541
[NARRATOR] Eren can neither
bring himself to transform,

370
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,916
[NARRATOR] nor fight
his former comrade in arms.
