1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,083
[NARRATOR] In the year 845,
two terrifying new breeds

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,583
[NARRATOR] of Titan appeared:
the Colossal and the Armored,

3
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,208
[NARRATOR] barreling
through the outer walls as if

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,166
[NARRATOR] wholesale
destruction was child's play.

5
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,875
[NARRATOR] The territory
couched within the circle

6
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,458
[NARRATOR] of Wall
Maria was abandoned.

7
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,416
[NARRATOR] Twenty percent
of the human race perished.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,291
[NARRATOR] As the
Titan onslaught advanced,

9
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:43,083
[NARRATOR] our only choice was
to withdrawal behind Wall Rose.

10
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,458
[NARRATOR] Five years
later, in the year 850...

11
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,666
[EREN] Mankind didn't
start this fight,

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,041
[EREN] but we're
gonna finish it!

13
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,416
[EREN] Mounted
Cannon Squad Four,

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,875
take out the Colossal Titan!

15
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,583
This is our chance!
Don't let it slip away!

16
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,166
You.

17
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,500
It's been a while.

18
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,250
[EREN] Son of a bitch.

19
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,000
[EREN] He took out the cannons!

20
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,708
[EREN] The gate
was no accident then.

21
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:19,833
[EREN] He-- He planned it.
He has intelligence!

22
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,750
[EREN] All the more reason
not to waste this moment!

23
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,750
[EREN] Without him, the
other Titans have nothing!

24
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,916
[EREN] I've gotta take him down!

25
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,458
Damn it!

26
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,250
Take this!

27
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,666
Ahhhhhhhh!

28
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,958
[EREN] How did I miss?

29
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,666
[EREN] What the--?

30
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,500
[EREN] Did he just
vanish into thin air?

31
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,791
Eren! Where'd he go? Did he
get away or'd you take him out?

32
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,375
He's gone! Exactly
like five years ago.

33
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:31,250
He's here one moment and
gone the next; just like that.

34
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,208
[EREN] I'm sorry, I--

35
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,125
Don't apologize. Look at us.
We were too scared to move.

36
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,666
Hey! Wallow on your own time!
In case you hadn't noticed,

37
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,000
there's a breach.
We have to act now!

38
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,000
If they start
pouring in, that's it!

39
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,541
[ELITE] Look alive!

40
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,916
Operation Colossal Titan
Response is in effect.

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,375
I expect you to
take part! Report to HQ!

42
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,125
[ELITE] If you got close to the
damn thing, we need details!

43
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,375
Sir!

44
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,250
Sir! We pray the Advance
Team will be victorious!

45
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:14,958
[chaos]

46
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,708
Pare down! Take only
what you need to survive!

47
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,250
[ELITE] File through
as calmly as possible!

48
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,750
[ELITE] You understand
what we're facing.

49
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,041
[ELITE] If they get through,

50
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,708
[ELITE] we'll have a
repeat of five years ago.

51
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,291
[ELITE] Consider this
the last line of defense!

52
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,958
[ELITE] The Titans get
held off here or nowhere!

53
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,291
[ELITE] Prepare to intercept!

54
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,875
[ELITE] Fire!

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
Soldiers, charge!

56
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,333
[ELITE] Out of the frying
pan and into the fire, cadets!

57
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,333
[ELITE] Time to put
your training to work!

58
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,833
I have faith each of you will
be a credit to your regiment!

59
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,458
I promise we'll
get through this.

60
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,166
You're safe as
long as I'm beside you.

61
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,583
[HANNA] Franz.

62
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,125
[EREN] Armin? What's wrong?

63
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,333
I-- Don't worry, I'm fine.

64
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,958
Just give me a second
for my nerves to settle.

65
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,291
[ARMIN] This is bad, isn't it?
There's a hole in the wall

66
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,541
[ARMIN] eight meters wide and
we don't even remotely have the

67
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,708
[ARMIN] engineering-
know-how to plug it.

68
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,916
[ARMIN] That huge boulder near
the front gate was our best bet,

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,708
[ARMIN] but we couldn't figure
out how to hoist it in place.

70
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,916
[ARMIN] Unless
we seal the breach,

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,416
the entire city's
as good as dead!

72
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,250
[ARMIN] How long do you think
before they take Wall Rose?

73
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,166
[ARMIN] Seriously,
how long? Think about it.

74
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,666
[ARMIN] Any time
the mood strikes them,

75
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,583
[ARMIN] they can wipe out
the human race in an afternoon!

76
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,166
[EREN] Armin!

77
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,666
Listen to me. You're focused
on the past. Look ahead.

78
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,250
[EREN] We're not gonna
be the victims anymore!

79
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,458
[ARMIN] Sorry, I-- I'm okay.

80
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,833
[MAN] Come now.
Take this seriously.

81
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:28,750
[MAN] Very well. Yet
another victory is mine.

82
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,583
[MAN] Dear oh dear. One would
think our monthly rows would see

83
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,500
[MAN] at least some
modest improvement

84
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,000
[MAN] in your approach
to the game, Pyxis.

85
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,666
One would think so, yes.

86
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,458
Clearly my brain is
inferior to yours, Lord Wald.

87
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,916
[laughing]

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,166
[WALD] Such obsequiousness from
the single highest-ranking

89
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,333
officer in the
southern territory.

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,791
Tell me. Seriously.

91
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,750
[WALD] How can you hope
to thwart the Titan--

92
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,500
[ELITE] Commander Pyxis,
sir! I bring news!

93
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,250
[WALD] I beg your
pardon, young man.

94
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,875
The Colossal Titan has laid
siege to the city of Trost!

95
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,666
[ELITE] Reports say the
gate has been destroyed!

96
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,250
Ah. This vintage is
worthy of your good taste.

97
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,958
One man of action to another.

98
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,333
I obsequiously
accept it as a gift.

99
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,583
[WALD] Where are
you going? Pyxis, wait!

100
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:38,166
[WALD] You can't just march
off! I command you to stay!

101
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,875
Preparations must be made!

102
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,500
[WALD] Assemble your troops
and establish a garrison

103
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,000
[WALD] around my
estate this instant!

104
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,500
Damn it all, it's your
sworn duty to defend us!

105
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:55,083
Lord Wald, Sir. Untold numbers
of our brave comrades-in-arms

106
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,125
are laying down their lives in
defense of Trost as we speak.

107
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,416
Commander, I'll go
ready the horses, Sir.

108
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,625
When the dust has
settled, there may well be

109
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,833
more graves than
people to dig them.

110
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,291
An astronomical number of lives
snuffed out in a twinkling.

111
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,125
Yes, well, no help for it,
is there? If it's their time.

112
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,750
Besides, what earthly good
can the presence of a man who

113
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,750
persistently loses to me
at chess do for them now?

114
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,583
Why not remain
where I can assist you?

115
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,791
Your lordship, if I may speak
freely. Should the commander

116
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,958
actually face a Titan in battle,
he won't feel compelled

117
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,750
to play down his skill
as he does with you.

118
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:35,875
That's enough,
soldier. Good day, Sir.

119
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,250
[PYXIS] I wish you another
opulently appointed day

120
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,500
[PYXIS] of sloth
and tranquility.

121
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,166
Please don't go.
Don't do this to me!

122
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,791
[WALD] Pyxis, please!
I'm beggin you!

123
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,708
[WALD] Pyxis!

124
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,333
[ELITE] I want everyone
split into four squadrons,

125
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,833
[ELITE] as practiced.

126
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,416
[ELITE] All squadrons are
responsible for supply-running,

127
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,958
ELITE] message relay,
and enemy combat

128
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,416
[MAN] under the command
of the Garrision Regiment!

129
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,625
The Intercept Squadron
will be taking the vanguard.

130
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,791
[ELITE] Cadets will be
taking the middle guard,

131
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,750
[ELITE] led by
the support squad.

132
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,625
[ELITE] Rear guard
will go to the elites.

133
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,625
[ELITE] I expect you
all to man your posts

134
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:30,125
[ELITE knowing the Advance
Team has been wiped out.

135
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,458
[ELITE] That's right;
the outer gate is history.

136
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,041
[ELITE] The Titans are in.

137
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,750
This means the "Armored
Titan" is likely to reappear.

138
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:42,166
[ELITE] If and when he does, the
inner gate will also be history.

139
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,250
Is this real?

140
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,750
Please be a dream.

141
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,291
God, what if the bastards manage
to bust through Wall Rose?

142
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,875
[ELITE] Quiet!

143
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,041
Right! Those in
the vanguard, be ready!

144
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,666
The whole area is
well-nigh saturated.

145
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,666
Your mission is
a very simple one:

146
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,666
Defend the wall 'til
the evacuation's done!

147
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,916
Now. Be aware, all of you,

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,875
that desertion is
punishable by execution!

149
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,708
[ELITE] If it comes to it, lay
down your lives! Dismissed!

150
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,166
[ALL] Sir!

151
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,041
[chatter]

152
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,125
[JEAN] Why'd this
have to happen now?

153
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,500
Just one more day
and I'd have been

154
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,458
heading for the Interior!

155
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,000
You gonna be alright?

156
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,625
[GIRL CADET] Please, no.
Please, no. Please, no.

157
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,333
Move it!

158
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,625
What the hell, man?
What's wrong with you?

159
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,958
What kinda question is that?

160
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,291
We're all about
to be Titan chow.

161
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,750
You expect me to sing
you a happy little song?

162
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,375
[JEAN] You're loving this,
aren't you, you little psycho?

163
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,791
[JEAN] 'Course you are!

164
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,000
[JEAN] You're whole life's
aspiration is to be eaten!

165
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,708
I was one day shy of
shipping off to the MP!

166
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,666
Jean! Get ahold--

167
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,666
No! Not all of us are suicidal!

168
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,208
Damn it! Shut up for second!

169
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,583
We're trained for this!

170
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,333
What do you think the
last three years were about?

171
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,791
We survived. We stared death
in the face and we lived.

172
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,041
Not everyone can
say that, can they?

173
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,291
Some people couldn't take it

174
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,166
and either ran
or were thrown out.

175
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,958
Hell, some people
actually died, but not us!

176
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,250
[EREN] Am I right? We powered
through for three years!

177
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,416
[EREN] What's one more day?

178
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,416
You can do this, Jean. Alright?

179
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,875
The MP will still be
waiting for you tomorrow.

180
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,000
Shit.

181
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,625
[JEAN] On your feet,
Daz. Stop bawling.

182
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,750
[DAZ] Um, okay.

183
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,041
Eren. If things take
a turn for the worse,

184
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,791
I want you to
come find me, alright?

185
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,625
What? We're in completely
different squads!

186
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,791
Look. This is gonna
get ugly and when it does

187
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,291
the plan goes out the window.

188
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,083
Come and find me
so I can protect you.

189
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,583
Who the hell do
you think you are?

190
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,666
[IAN] Ackermann, you're with me.

191
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,833
You've been assigned to the
rear guard on special orders.

192
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,250
Let's get moving.

193
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,750
[MIKASA] But, sir! I'm a
cadet! I'll slow everyone down!

194
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,166
What?

195
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,416
You're not being asked
for a self-evaluation here.

196
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,583
The mass exodus
is falling apart.

197
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,916
We need as many elite soldiers

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,625
as possible to get
things back on track.

199
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,875
Sir. With all due re--!

200
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,750
Hey!

201
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,750
You've been given a direct
order! Pull it together. Now!

202
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,000
This is bigger than the
two of us and you know it!

203
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,625
We're on the verge
of extinction here.

204
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,833
Have some damn perspective!

205
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,791
You're right; I'm sorry.

206
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,083
This whole situation
just has me out of my head.

207
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,416
Just promise--
Promise me one thing.

208
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,583
Whatever happens.
Don't get yourself killed.

209
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,625
[EREN] I hadn't
planned on it. Thanks.

210
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:01,041
No. I won't allow
myself to get killed.

211
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,750
[EREN] Not until I
taste what life is like

212
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,541
[EREN] outside of
these godforsaken walls.

213
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,333
[MAN] What surviving historical
documents we have access to

214
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,958
[MAN] tell us nothing
of the Titans' origin.

215
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,750
Almost everything
about them is obscure.

216
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,708
Now, that isn't to suggest
we're completely ignorant.

217
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,916
[Teacher] Thanks to the efforts
of the Scout Regiment,

218
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,750
[TEACHER] we do know
something of their ecology.

219
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,208
[TEACHER] Whether Titans
possess human-like intelligence

220
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,166
[TEACHER] is up
for debate, of course.

221
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,916
[TEACHER] And to date
there've been no reports

222
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,125
[TEACHER] of high-level
communication between them.

223
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,291
[TEACHER] We do know
that Titan physiology is

224
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,791
[TEACHER] fundamentally
different than most

225
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,541
[TEACHER] organic life. As
they lack reproductive organs,

226
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,625
[TEACHER] it's unclear
how they reproduce.

227
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,250
[TEACHER] Apart from this,
to all appearances,

228
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,500
[TEACHER] their
physique resembles

229
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,125
[TEACHER] the average
human male. We also know

230
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,500
[TEACHER] their body
temperatures run quite high.

231
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,000
[TEACHER] And, baffling though
it is, their appetite seems

232
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,208
[TEACHER] geared exclusively
towards human beings.

233
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,500
[TEACHER] In fact, a
Titan's driving principle

234
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,958
[TEACHER] seems
to be this appetite.

235
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,708
[TEACHER] Given that
they've subsisted for

236
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,291
[TEACHER] over a
century without access to

237
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,541
[TEACHER] their only source
of nourishment, however,

238
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,875
[TEACHER] we surmise that
these creatures do not in fact,

239
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,791
[TEACHER] consume us to live.

240
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,708
[TEACHER] Let that sink in.

241
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,416
[TEACHER] Titans aren't
motivated by hunger as such.

242
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,875
[TEACHER] They're
simply in it for the kill.

243
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,166
The terrifying vitality
of these creatures

244
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,250
is beyond scientific dispute.

245
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:28,125
We have only to consider events
of the recent past to see this.

246
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,791
[TEACHER] Mankind has long
possessed cannon technology,

247
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,333
[TEACHER] as you're aware.

248
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,125
[TEACHER] But that alone proved
tragically insufficient.

249
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,958
[TEACHER] Even with
their heads blown to bits,

250
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,458
[TEACHER] the Titans persist.

251
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,708
[TEACHER] Though there is
some variability on this score,

252
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,250
[TEACHER] a Titan's head usually
regenerates within two minutes.

253
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,416
Is that true?

254
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
As if their size
wasn't frightening enough.

255
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,916
Excuse me, sir.

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Are you basically saying
that the Titans are immortal?

257
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,750
[TEACHER] No, I'm not.

258
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,083
There is, in fact,
one way to ensure death.

259
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,916
Strike here.

260
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,208
[TEACHER] If the back of their
neck takes adequate damage,

261
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,708
[TEACHER] a Titan
will not regenerate.

262
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,958
[TEACHER] This is the chink
in the proverbial armor.

263
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,458
[TEACHER] That, as
you may have surmised,

264
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,041
[TEACHER] is where
the flesh-paring blades

265
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,875
[TEACHER] you see here
come in. A good, deep strike

266
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,166
[TEACHER] with one of these
to a Titan's weak spot,

267
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,000
[TEACHER] and the monster
is left no time to regenerate.

268
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,666
[TEACHER] They
die and stay dead.

269
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,833
[EREN] Look at
it this way, Armin.

270
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,625
[EREN] It's a
golden opportunity.

271
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,708
I mean if we prove our
worth as soldiers right here,

272
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,375
we'll rise up right
through the ranks.

273
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,916
Before long we could even
be leading our own regiment.

274
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,916
We can bypass rookie
status altogether!

275
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,208
Sounds good. I'm
with you all the way.

Good luck beatin' us to the
punch a second time, Eren.

279
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,500
No head-starts
for you this round!

280
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,791
[EREN] Is that a challenge?

281
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,666

kills the most Titans

Well, they're going to

sneak outside the walls
to see for themselves.

340
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,875
They'll know what
it's like firsthand.

341
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,583
[ARMIN] Look at me.

342
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,291
We should do it ourselves one
day. We can have adventures

343
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,916

I refuse to die

Armin, listen. We're still
going to the outside world.

349

[EREN] The things
you told me about...

350

I have to see them. I have to!

[NARRATOR] The sound
is so faint. So gentle.

356
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,333
[NARRATOR]
The scent so like flowers.

00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:23,416
[NARRATOR] Odd how it can remind
you of something so horrible.
