It's not like there are
books on the subject.

Hers was not a happy childhood.

[ERWIN] Lord Reiss is the
key to all this somehow.

Since then, I've been thinking.

143
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,458
When she left,
Ymir chose her own path.

I have no right to change that.
She doesn't need me to.

kept your mouth shut.

Well, that girl
isn't me anymore.

00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,958
Good. I didn't really like her.

No one's actually as nice
as you pretended to be.

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,416
[SANNES]
This isn't your jurisdiction.

176
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,458
A simple robbery murder.

177
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,541
[SANNES] There've been
a string of 'em lately.

178
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,500
[HANGE gasps]

179
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,916
I'm not buying it!

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,583
His nails were torn out--[gasps]

181
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,916
Which unit are you in?

182
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,875
Section Commander Hange,
Fourth Squad.

183
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,291
And I'm XO Moblit Berner.

184
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,916
Heh. You know, when your
whole branch is garbage,

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,500
being high-ranked doesn't
make you smell any sweeter.

186
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:42,125
Listen. That man wasn't
killed by a Titan.

187
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,750
One person killed another.
This isn't Scout business.

188
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,958
[HANGE] You're with
the First Interior Squad.

189
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,875
[SANNES, RALPH gasp]

190
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,125
[MOBLIT]
Funny. What're the capital's

191
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,083
MPs doing down here in Trost?

192
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,583
What's so strange about it?

193
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,375
Somebody has to get
the real work done

194
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,125
while you people run
around playing soldier.

195
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,208
Yes. You're completely right.

196
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,000
I see now I'm worthless
compared to you.

197
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,625
Simply being in your
presence is an honor.

198
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,458
Please, allow me
to shake your hand!

199
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,708
All right. You said
it was a robbery?

200
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,000
Poor Nick. I didn't realize
he even had anything

201
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,000
that was worth stealing.

202
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,375
Of course he did.

203
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,583
Everybody knows the Church

204
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,083
makes all its little
trinkets out of iron.

205
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,750
[gasps] Are you saying
Nick was affiliated with

206
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,208
the Order of the Walls?

207
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,250
What are you playing at?

208
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,250
He was a friend of mine,
that's why I rushed down here.

209
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,208
Except... I thought
he was a craftsman.

210
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,083
Making chairs or something.

211
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,958
I even put that on his
application to board here.

212
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,125
Let go!

213
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,416
[HANGE] Still. I suppose
this is a reminder

214
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,916
that we never really know people
as well as we think we do.

215
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,666
Enough. Let go!

216
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,291
[HANGE gasps]
Of course! Sorry.

217
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,125
Well, then, I wish you luck
with the investigation.

218
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,416
When you catch the culprit,

219
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,958
will you tell them
something for me?

220
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,541
"You may feel that what you
did to him was justified,

221
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,500
perhaps even righteous.

222
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,125
Well, I don't give a single
shit what your motivation was.

223
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,791
I promise you, I will
personally see to it

224
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,416
that you are tortured,
and the horrors visited upon you

225
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,916
will be greater than
any my friend suffered.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,500
Yes. Far greater."

227
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,458
Please pass that along.
We'll leave you to it.

228
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,833
The pastor. You think
they killed him?

229
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,208
Yes, I do. That man's
name was Djel Sannes.

230
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,541
The skin on his fist
was split open.

231
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,291
Nick was tortured by
the Interior Military Police,

232
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,000
and then murdered.

233
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,041
[HANGE] I figured
the Church would want to

234
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,500
get their hands on Nick
when they learned

235
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,208
he was cooperating
with the Scouts.

236
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,750
That's why I hid his identity

237
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,833
and had him stay
in the barracks.

238
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,958
I never imagined they would
use soldiers to kill him.

239
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:10,000
This was my fault. I should
have been more careful.

240
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,750
They tortured him.
Presumably for information.

241
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,750
Did they just want to know

242
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,041
what exactly he'd
passed on to us?

243
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,625
Most likely.

244
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,541
But these are the Interior
MPs we're dealing with,

245
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,583
so you can bet there's
something deeper at work here.

246
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,666
Now, how many nails was
the good pastor missing?

247
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,583
Uh?

248
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,625
How many? You saw, right?

249
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,875
I only caught a glimpse of him,

250
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,583
but all the nail beds
I saw were empty.

251
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,000
People who talk, talk after one.

252
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,958
If they don't, ripping off more
won't make a difference.

253
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:51,458
I'm impressed. I didn't
think highly of Pastor Nick.

254
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,750
But whatever his faults,

255
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,208
he stuck by his beliefs
until the end.

256
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:04,583
Which means... they have no idea
we know about the Reiss family.

257
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,750
But, the government
is up to something.

258
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,500
And we've got a
target on our backs.

259
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,416
[door opens]

260
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,916
[NIFA]
Captain Levi, sir.

261
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,208
I have a message
from Commander Erwin.

262
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,125
[NIFA] I went to tell him
about Pastor Nick,

263
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,750
but he gave me this
and sent me off.

264
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,375
Get your gear, now!

265
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,708
We're leaving.

266
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,583
Make it look like
we were never here.

267
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,750
[ALL gasp]

268
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,916
[CONNY] That was close.
What if they had caught us?

269
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,875
Would they rip our nails off?

270
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,416
How did Commander Erwin
know they were headed here?

271
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,125
The government's passed
down some new orders.

272
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,125
There's been a freeze on all
Scout activity outside the wall.

273
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,541
We're to hand over
Eren and Historia.

274
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,708
[BOTH gasp]

275
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,000
Captain. I didn't
have time to tell you,

276
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,583
but some MPs came
for the commander

277
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,250
right after I left him.

278
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,000
What? Like he's
some kind of criminal?

279
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,916
They're bringing this fight
out into the open.

280
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,958
No more working
from the shadows.

281
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,458
[HANGE] They're going to protect
the walls' secrets at any cost.

282
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,958
But why? And what exactly

283
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,833
are they after
Eren and Historia for?

284
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,500
They don't want them dead,
so what are they planning?

285
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,125
Who knows?

286
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,208
But they want these two

287
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,833
and they're not being
subtle about it.

288
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,666
Which makes lingering
here dangerous.

289
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,916
We'll move Eren
and Historia to Trost.

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,041
[ALL gasp]

291
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,416
We're taking them
to the same district

292
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,666
where Pastor Nick
was just murdered?

293
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,250
Heading toward the
interior would be worse.

294
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,791
With Trost in a panic,
it should be easy to slip in.

295
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:47,000
And if things do go all to hell,
we can use these in the city.

296
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,416
That's true.

297
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,666
We don't know the identity
of our enemy yet.

298
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,333
I have an idea of
how we can change that.

299
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,333
Hange, I'll need you to
lend me some of your squad.

300
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,833
No problem.

301
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,375
[HANGE] All right, I'm going
after Commander Erwin.

302
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,166
Moblit's with me. The rest
of you will go with Levi.

303
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,791
[ABEL, KEIJI, NIFA]
Roger!

304
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,916
[EREN gasps]
Hange!

305
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,916
[EREN]
Here.

306
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,958
I remembered a conversation
between Ymir and Bertholdt.

307
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,583
I wrote it down for you.
It's all there.

308
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:26,000
Thank you. I'll take
a look at it later.

309

--[HANGE] Hiyah!

00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,375
[MAN] Heh. The kid may be
small, but he's disciplined.

312
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,833
I'll give him that.

313
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,416
[CAVEN]
An acquaintance of yours?

314
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,791
[MAN]
An old one.

00:16:53,916 --> 00:17:00,041
[bells ringing]

00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,041
[LEVI] Try not to walk
clustered together.

317
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,583
We'll stand out.

318
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,041
Eren and Historia,
just act normal.

319
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,916
Why's the royal flag
hanging everywhere?

320
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,250
Today must be the anniversary
of the king's coronation.

321
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,416
Once a year they hand out
extra rations to celebrate it.

322
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,625
Oh.

323
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,416
[MP 38A] May I have
your attention, please.

324
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,333
King Fritz has heard of
the hardships in Trost.

325
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,000
He is donating the
royal family's reserves.

326

[VILLAGERS gasp]

327
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,500
[MP 38A]
Form a line.

328
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,375

[VILLAGER 38B]
Long live King Fritz!

331
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,875
All that food and he's
just giving it away?

332
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,583
It's not as if he needs it all.

333
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,750
Easier to control people
when they're not starving.

334
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,708
[AURILLE]
Handing out those rations

335
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,750
depleted more than
60% of the reserves.

336
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,291
That's a steep cost just to
raise morale a bit, Lord Reiss.

337
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,750
Quite steep.

338
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,166
[ROD] It was necessary.
We had to do something

339
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,541
to improve the public's
opinion of the royal family.

340
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,041
Now we just need the other
pieces of the puzzle.

341
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,583
And the sooner we
have them, the better.

342
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,041
[GERALD] The Military Police
failed us again?

343
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,000
I'll return at once.
We'll continue the hunt.

344
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,208
[ROD] No, we'll soon
have what we need.

00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,208
Things are in motion now.

346
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:32,208
[VILLAGERS chattering]

347
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,500
[LEVI]
Behind us! Look out!

348
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,250
[SASHA gasps]
Armi--

349
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,208
Uh, I mean, Christa and Eren!

350
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,500
Those bastards are
running off with them!

351
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,166
[EREN]
Will it really work again?

352
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:59,125
With that horse face of his,
we look nothing alike.

353
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,375
Well, Jean. Good luck.

354
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:06,333
[COMRADE OF REEVES 38A
chuckling]

355
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,416
[COMRADE OF REEVES 38A]
Yeah. So nice.

356
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,625
Let me hear how
much you like it.

357
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,166
Well? How's that?

358
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,166
Feels good, doesn't it?

359
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,375
Come on, I'm dying to
hear that sweet voice.

360
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,750
[ARMIN gasps]

361
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:24,458
[COMRADE OF REEVES 38A
panting, giggling]

362
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,666
[JEAN]
This is why I didn't want to

363
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,958
go through this shit
a second time.

364
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,708
Screw being his body double.

365
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:30,916
[COMRADE OF REEVES 38A]
Just give me one

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,041
little moan, lovely.
You know you want to.

367
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,708
How's everything going inside?

368
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,041
If we wait very much longer,

369
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,916
they'll see through
Armin's disguise.

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,208
He's... getting pawed at.

371
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,375
I see.

372
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,791
[MIKASA]
How's your leg? Any better?

373
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:57,916
I can move well enough.
Now, then. Did you notice?

374
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,375
These kidnappers are
obviously rank amateurs.

375
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,750
Why wouldn't they
use professionals

376
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,416
for a job like this?

377
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,875
You can handle
the rest on your own.

378
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,666
I'm gonna make my way to Eren.

379
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,041
Come and meet up with
me when you're done

380
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,250
taking out the trash here.

381
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,041
Yes, sir.

382
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,083
[LEVI] There's one more
thing you should know.

383
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,458
Just in case.

384
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,541
[LEVI]
Tell Armin and the others, too.

385
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,791
[door thuds]

386
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,458
[REEVES]
You're sure about this?

387
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,041
These are the two
we're lookin' for?

388
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,416
[COMRADE OF REEVES 38C]
Yeah, they fit the descriptions

389
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,625
we were given to a tee.

390
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,833
[REEVES]
Huh? Where's the guard?

391
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,250
[COMRADE OF REEVES 38C groans]

392
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,000
[BOTH gasp]

393
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,875
[COMRADE OF REEVES 38E groaning]

394
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,416
What the hell?

395
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,000
[COMRADE OF REEVES 38D groaning]

396
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,250
[JEAN]
Don't even think about moving.

397
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,416
[REEVES groans]

398
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,958
Conny! Are these four
really all of them?

399
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,916
Yeah, that's all.

400
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,666
No one else in the area.

401
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,000
Move again and you won't like
where the next shot hits.

402
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,375
[MIKASA] All right! First,
we get these guys secured.

403
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,833
Then, we meet up
with the captain.

404
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,250
[ARMIN]
What do you mean?

405
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,041
[MIKASA] Those are his orders.
He left a message, too.

406
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,208
[BOTH]
Huh?

407
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,000
[horse neighs]

408
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,916
You there! Out of the way!

409
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,291
[NIFA]
Captain.

410
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,791
Well?

411
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,500
The road's crowded,
but I've seen nothing unusual.

412
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,583
It's not far to
Commander Pyxis' from here,

413
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,625
so I think we're good, but how's
the body double mission?

414
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,666
A success.

415
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,958
You don't seem very
pleased about that.

416
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,458
I'm not.

417
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,125
[LEVI]
Something's wrong.

418
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,958
Military Police
can't be behind this.

419
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,250
They're too careful of their
reputation to use amateurs.

420
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,541
[LEVI]
This is more like...

421
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,041
[LEVI] ...they'd know the
wagon would be followed.

422
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,291
[LEVI] It's support team
wouldn't be far behind.

423
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,791
[NIFA]
Captain.

424
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,000
Wagon's almost
on the move again.

425
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,708
Nifa, you've heard of
Kenny the Ripper?

426
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,500
That mass-murderer
in the capital?

427
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,375
The one who slit the throats
of over a hundred MPs?

428
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,500
Of course, but I always thought
he was just an urban legend.

429
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,416
The stories are all true.
He's no legend.

430
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,583
[NIFA]
Huh?

431
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,458
I lived with him,
back when I was a kid.

432
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah. Very funny, sir.

433
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,041
This isn't really the time
to be making jokes.

434
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,833
[LEVI] That's right. He wouldn't
care about using amateurs.

435
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:52,041
[LEVI] The team would trail the
wagon from both rear angles.

436
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,083
They'd choose a spot high up.

437
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,500
Somewhere with
a clear line of sight.

438
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,000
[gasps] Nifa!

439
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,583
[LEVI grunts]

00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,000
[ABEL gasps, groans]

00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,416
[MOTHER 38A gasps, screams]

442
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,583
Long time, Levi.

443
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,291
Still a runt,
or have you grown some?

444
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,916
[MAN]
Woo-hoo!

445
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,625
Nope. Don't look like you've
changed much at all, boy.

446
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,166
Kenny!


447
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,083
[NARRATOR]
Kenny and Levi meet again.

448
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:04,208
The enemy has their sights
set on Eren and Historia.

449
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,500
In order to get
their comrades back,

450
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,750
Levi and the others
must take aim and shoot.

451
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,958
Next episode: "Pain."
