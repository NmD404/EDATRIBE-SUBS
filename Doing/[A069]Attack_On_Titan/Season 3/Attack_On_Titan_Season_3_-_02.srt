00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,708
[ARMIN panting]

179
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,000
[ARMIN]
Was it like this for you?

180
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,833
[gasps]

181
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,000
[ARMIN sniffing]
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,041
[MIKASA]
It's okay.

183
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,791
[ARMIN]
I'm sorry. I--

184
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,208
[gunshot]

185
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,875
[JEAN gasps]

186
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,291
[thud]

187
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,250
[LEVI]
Shit! Armin! Jean!

188
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,791
[ALL grunt]

189
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,208
[gasps]

190
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,416
Let 'em go.
We're running on fumes.

191
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
No!

192
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,291
[BOTH grunting]

193
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,833
Eren!

194
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:46,208
What's wrong? Did all this
filth kill your appetite?

195
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:51,500
[ARMIN] No. Jean, there's
something I don't understand.

196
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,250
What's that?

197
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,458
[ARMIN] When I turned
around to try to save you...

198
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,500
...that woman already
had her gun to your head.

199
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:04,833
It's... funny. How could I
have shot before she did?

200
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,083
I don't know.

201
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,500
[LEVI] You shot first
because she hesitated.

202
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,000
--[gasps]
--[LEVI] It's simple.

203
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,541
[ARMIN gasps]

204
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,458
I'm sorry, Armin.
You wouldn't've had to save me

205
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,541
if I'd just done my job.

206
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,291
[ARMIN]
I know what it is.

207
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,458
[ARMIN]
The woman I shot back there.

208
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,375
I bet she was a
really kind person.

209
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,333
She must've had a lot more
human empathy than I ever did.

210
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,708
I pulled that trigger so easily.

211
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,583
Without a thought.

212
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,583
I'm...

213
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,916
A killer.

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,250
And now that your hands
have been soaked in blood,

215
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,750
the person you once
were is gone for good.

216
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,708
[MIKASA gasps]
Why would you say that?

217
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,041
And you shouldn't
regret it for one second.

218
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,333
Because if you'd chosen
to keep your hands clean,

219
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,583
Jean would be a corpse
on a cart right now.

220
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,583
[JEAN] I'll tell you why
you pulled the trigger.

221
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,125
Because your comrade
was about to die.

222
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:10,000
Armin. Everyone on our
squad survived today

223
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,708
because you got
blood on your hands.

224
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,083
Thank you.

225
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,333
Captain Levi, I, uh,
I thought it was wrong

226
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,750
for us to fight
other humans, sir.

227
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,041
I thought it was wrong that
you'd ordered us to do it.

228
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,791
I mean, we became soldiers
to protect people.

229
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,958
But now, I see that
I was in the wrong, sir.

230
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,916
Next time, I swear I'll shoot.

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,333
[LEVI] I never said anything
about what was right or wrong.

232
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,625
My moral high ground's
shot to hell.

233
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:48,000
I have no idea who's
in the right at this point.

234
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:56,666
Now then, I think it's time we
heard what our guest has to say.

235
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,875
[REEVES gasps]
Mercy, please!

236
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,083
I'm just an old man
they use to move cargo.

237
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,583
I didn't want to, but they--

238
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,500
[MIKASA]
I've met this one before.

239
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,166
[MIKASA] He seemed to be
a prominent merchant.

240
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,833
[REEVES gasps]

241
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,791
[LEVI] Yeah, I know him.
Dimo Reeves, right?

242
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,416
[REEVES grunts]

243
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,541
This damn job was forced
on us by the Military Police.

244
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,625
And now that we
completely botched it,

245
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,083
they'll plunder
the Reeves Company

246
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,750
for everything its worth.

247
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,166
First, they'll kill me,

248
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,416
and then they'll
set up "accidents"

249
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,375
for all my employees.
My dumb son, too.

250
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,791
[FLEGEL gasps]

251
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,833
[LEVI] You just gonna
lay down and take it?

252
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,541
There's a reason Trost recovered
from that Titan attack.

253
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,375
It's largely because
of jobs and money

254
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,583
brought in by
the Reeves Company.

255
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,125
Tell me, if your company
were to disappear,

256
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,250
how many would survive
the coming winter?

257
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,083
So, what? You want
me to join you?

258
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,166
[LEVI] We just need to know
where Eren and Historia are.

259
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,250
If you're in contact with
the MPs, I think I have a plan.

260
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,500
And can you give me your word
that the people of Trost

261
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,833
won't end up starving to death?

262
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,583
[LEVI]
I can't guarantee it. That said,

263
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:15,291
I believe they'll have a better
chance with us than without.

264
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,875
[horse neighs]

265
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,666
[HANGE]
About time the bastards left.

266
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,708
Our situation just got worse!

267
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,625
I have two things
to report, Commander.

268
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:35,125
First, Eren and Historia have
been abducted by the enemy.

269
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,333
Three from my squad were
killed in the fighting.

270
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,083
I'm about to meet
Captain Levi and follow up

271
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,000
on a lead he might have as to
their current whereabouts.

272
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,458
[ERWIN]
Understood. What else?

273
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,458
Eren remembered a
conversation he overheard

274
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,250
between Ymir and Bertholdt.

275
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,500
But, if this is
actually true, then--

276
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,333
Shit. I feel like my
head's gonna explode.

277
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,083
--[MOBLIT] Are you okay?
--[HANGE groans]

278
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,500
[ERWIN]
What's the problem?

279
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,916
[HANGE gulping]

280
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,708
Unless we recover him quickly,
Eren will be devoured.

281
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,708
[SANNES]
Hey! How'd you find 'em anyway?

282
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,083
They found me. I promised
them that I'd cooperate,

283
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,625
and for some reason
they believed me.

284
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,041
Are we there? [gasps]

285
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,000
[gasps, groans]

286
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,958
Reeves, you piece of--[groans]

287
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,416
Sorry, gents. That's how it is.

288
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,541
What happens now?

289
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,041
Do you think this means
we'll be safe? Or what?

290
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,583
There's no guarantee.

291
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,583
Say what? Then why'd we do it?

292
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,583
A good merchant has to
learn to trust his nose.

293
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,666
And not just to
smell easy money,

294
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,875
but to sniff out the potential
for future profit, too.

295
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,208
Once you have, you bite
and you don't let go.

296
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,333
You remember that, son.

297
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,875
I made it! You haven't
finished yet, have you?

298
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,500
No. Haven't even
gotten my feet wet.

299
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,250
Sannes! I'm only a novice
at human torture,

300
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,875
but while I lack experience,
I plan to give this job my all.

301
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,333
Hold on! At least
tell me what you want!

302
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,875
Who the hell tortures someone
without asking questions?

303
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,458
[LEVI] Oh, yeah. We do
have some questions.

304
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,958
Where were Eren
and Historia taken?

305
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,875
What do you want with Historia,

306
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,583
and what is the Reiss family?

307
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,875
[HANGE]
Come on!

308
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,500
Can't you see that we're
in a time crunch here?

309
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,041
[SANNES screaming]

310
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,625
[JEAN]
Here we go again.

311
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,333
[SASHA] The screams seem
a lot louder than they were

312
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,708
when the captain did it.

313
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,500
[CONNY] I know it's to
save our friends, but...

314
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,291
...it still makes me sick.

315
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,250
Let's face the facts.
We're criminals now.

316
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,416
[ALL gasp]

317
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,750
Our last enemy wanted to eat us.

318
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,000
We don't have an excuse like
that for killing these people.

319
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,916
It's just that their
views are different.

320
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,625
No. It's just that
they're in another group.

321
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,041
[ARMIN] And for that,
we'll take their lives.

322
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,291
Armin.

323
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,250
We're not good people.
Not anymore, at least.

324
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,708
[HANGE] Sorry. I don't have
your knack for peeling nails.

325
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,416
Just how many did
you have to rip off

326
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,708
to get so good at it?

327
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,916
More than I could keep track of.

328
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,250
Within these cramped,
squalid walls,

329
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,291
war has never broken out,
and I can tell you why.

330
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,375
It's because we of
the First Interior Squad

331
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:39,041
dirtied our hands to
protect the king's peace!

332
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,041
A teacher too smart
for his own good.

333
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,500
A stupid couple
who tried to fly.

334
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,250
A whore who screwed
the wrong man!

335
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,791
No matter how
they'd beg or plead,

336
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,875
we erased them
to protect humanity!

337
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,083
You should be on
your knees thanking me!

338
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,833
In all my years,
I've never seen anyone

339
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,708
take such pleasure from
human suffering as you!

340
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,583
You're both monsters!

341
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,166
But I'm determined to
face you without fear.

342
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,375
Do what you will.
For I--I have my faith.

343
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:11,750
And I believe in the king and
in peace within these walls.

344
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,250
I believe that every last
one of my wretched deeds

345
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,125
was justified, but...

346
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,083
To think that it
hurt this much...

347
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,375
[SANNES] If you're going
to torture me to death,

348
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,916
get on with it.

349
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,708
That sounds like a fitting end
for this blood-stained life.

350
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,500
Time for a break.

351
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,166
Ugh. Damn it all.

352
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,666
I'm starting to
feel sorry for him.

353
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,791
[RALPH]
Quit shovin' me. It hurts.

354
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,000
[gasps] Ralph!

355
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,916
How pathetic can you get?

356
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,500
Can't believe you started
talking after just one nail.

357
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,916
[SANNES gasps]

358
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,208
[LEVI] Sannes doesn't
have any nails left.

359
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,041
He's a real soldier.

360
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,916
Like I care. He can get
tortured all he wants.

361
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,708
The guy never shuts up
about peace and the king.

362
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,166
The rest of us all
hate his damn guts.

363
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,375
Just do us a favor
and kill him already.

364
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,291
[gasps]

365
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,708
[LEVI] We're gonna
have to keep him around

366
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,000
until he's verified
what you told us.

367
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,208
Yeah? Well, you got everything
you wanted out of me,

368
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,333
so why don't you
lay off already?

369
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:24,291
Oh, and about my cell.
It'll have a bed, right?

370
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,333
[SANNES sighs]

371
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,041
[HANGE] Ready, Sannes?
We're gonna try it again!

372
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,375
This isn't easy for me either,

373
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,041
but I'll be the best
torturer I can--

374
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,041
Reiss is the true royal family.

375
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,916
[REEVES] So much for
keepin' a low profile.

376
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,375
How long is that
boy gonna take?

377
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,416
[exhales]

378
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,833
Ya know, the one thing
a merchant should never

379
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,833
sell out of is trust.

380
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,750
[REEVES groans]

381
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,708
Was it wise to do that
without asking where Levi is?

382
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,375
[KENNY] He'll show up
no matter what we do.

383
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,208
[CAVEN]
How do you know that?

384
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,375
'Cause I raised him, that's how.

385
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,083
Levi Ackermann's not one
to give up the chase.

386
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,416
[ARMIN] You mean the rightful
heir to the throne is...

387
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,375
...Historia?

388
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,958
[HANGE] That's correct.
And based on that knowledge,

389
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,666
we're assuming that she and Eren
have been taken to Lord Reiss.

390
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,375
[LEVI]
That's him.

391
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,625
[ROD]
Historia.

392
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,583
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

393
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,875
[gasps]

394
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,208
♪ Closing Song ♪

395
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,750
[NARRATOR]
One girl's tortured past

396
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:03,750
holds a secret that could
change the fate of a kingdom.

397
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,166
Once this secret
is known to Erwin,

398
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,000
he remembers his own past.

399
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,958
