181
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,458
We're so close...

It's fine.

185
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,916
I'm taking it back.

186
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,041
[HANGE] I know we're
overdue for some luck,

187
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,250
but how have we not
seen any Titans yet?

188
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,000
We still have to continue.

189
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,208
Right.

190
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,583
We have no cause to call it off.

No...

194

We can do this!

195
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,625
[EREN]
Because we're special,

196
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,583
for no other reason than
the fact that we were born!

197
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,833
We will be free!

strike any second!

Stay on the lookout!

203
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,125

It's fine.

207
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,375
That said, I did manage
to shake off my cloak.

209
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,208

Thank you.

210
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,208
How's it look?

211
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,541
[MALE SOLDIER 50E]
Looks good over here!

212
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,625
[MALE SOLDIER 50F]
Yeah, our end's plugged, too!

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,500
We pulled it off. Huh.

214
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,666
Eren, are you okay?

215
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,166
Not even tired.

216
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,833
All that training's paid off.

217
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,583
[HANGE]
We shouldn't waste time then.

218
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,750
Everyone, head for
the inner gate!

219
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,875
And keep your faces hidden!

220
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,166
Did I actually seal that gate?

221
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,208
Seemed too easy.

222
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,833
You did it. I saw you.

223
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,041
Try to have faith in
your own strength.

224
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,333
[EREN]
I finally took it back.

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,333
--[LEVI] We're not finished.
--[EREN gasps]

226

[LEVI] You can plug
the gates all you want,

227
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,041
but they can just
break them again later.

228
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,916
Until we've killed
Reiner, Bertholdt,

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,750
and whoever else
may be with them,

230
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,625
the operation to retake
Wall Maria won't be over.

231
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,625
Yeah.

232
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,166
I'm well aware.

233
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,166
[DIRK] The outer gate was
closed off successfully,

234
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,708
but something feels wrong here.

235
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,750
The enemy should've
attacked by now.

236
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,583
Right, Erwin?

237
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,916
So why haven't we seen
a single Titan yet?

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,500
Is it possible that they just
weren't ready to fight us?

239
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,416
We can hope, but considering
what Arlelt found...

240
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,375
--[whirring]

[ARMIN grunts]

242
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,333
I looked into it.

243
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,750
It's clear that someone
was camping on the wall.

244
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,875
I found cups and a
cold pot on the ground,

245
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,875
near where I
spotted those ashes.

246
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,041
They were drinking
something like black tea.

247
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,291
[ARMIN sniffs]

248
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,750
[ARMIN]
What was in here?

249
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,083
It smells good.

250
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,541
[ARMIN]
There were three cups,

251
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,458
and they all had the same
black liquid in the bottom.

252
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,500
So I'd say there were three
people camping up here at least.

253
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,958
Wait. There's a third?

254
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,166
Was the pot completely
cool to the touch?

255
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,083
Yes.

256
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,458
That's troubling.

257
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,458
Agreed.

258
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,083
Huh? Why's that?

259
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,041
We charged here at
full speed on horseback.

260
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,958
Even switched to ODM gear.

261
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,875
Had they noticed our approach
by sight, or perhaps by sound,

262
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,666
they couldn't have had more
than two minutes to react.

263
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,333
But a pot over flame
wouldn't have cooled

264
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,250
in that short of time.

265
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,583
[DIRK gasps]

266
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,750
[ERWIN] They had to have
known that we were coming

267
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,250
for five minutes or more.

268
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,166
Which tells me they've
had plenty of time

269
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,833
to prepare for our arrival.

270
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:49,791
There's no way.

271
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,250
How'd they know?

272
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,541
Well, it's possible
that they had a scout

273
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,041
in addition to the
three on the wall.

274
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,333
Yeah.

275
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,083
We should assume we
have many enemies

276
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,666
and that they could be anywhere.

277
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,083
You need to sharpen your focus
on the enemies that are nearby.

278
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,541
I trust you.

279
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,916

you've saved us from
disaster countless times.

281
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,166
Now do it again.

the inner gate, find them.

obey Armin Arlelt's commands.

What are your
instructions, Arlelt?

293
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,208
We'll send one group to
each side of the wall.

294

Search the interiors of any
buildings near the gate!

300
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,500
No. Arlelt's proven himself.

He's one of our
greatest weapons.

302

What now?

305
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,625
Should we halt the operation
till we find the enemy?

306
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,083
We continue.

307
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,208
We'll lose a prolonged
campaign in enemy territory.

308
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:25,541
To prevail, our only chance
is to win a decisive battle.

With that in mind,
even if all has

310
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,166
gone according to the
enemy's plan thus far,

311
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,041

In any case,

matter how much we search?

by using Titan powers in ways
we could never have imagined!

355
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,916
If we constrain ourselves
to normal tactical reasoning,

356
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,875
then we'll never be able
to gain the upper hand!

[MALE SOLDIER 50I] That's the
signal to halt the mission!

360
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,791
Everyone scatter and
stand by on top of the wall!

361
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,208
[SOLDIERS]
Understood!

362
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,541

There are times to be strict

363
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,875
and times to be flexible.

364

Uphold the principles
of your vows.

365
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,125
Do what it takes to win.

Follow the chain of command

367

on the path to victory.

[grunts] Form two groups again
and check the wall's surface!

What are they doing?

375
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,333
Is this safe?

376
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,041
Feel like a sitting duck.

377
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,458
I don't know,

378
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,708
but this doesn't seem like
much of a surprise attack.

379
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,125
I wonder.

380
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,208
Did Armin figure something out?

381
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,541
[ARMIN] A position they'll
be able to react from,

382

no matter when
Eren might appear.

383
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,291
A position from which they can
see everything that happens.

384
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,625
If there's a hiding
spot like that,

385
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,958
then it must be in the walls.

386
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,541
Assuming the enemy doesn't know

387
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,708
that we're aware of
the Titans in the wall,

388
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,166
they'd have every
reason to think

389
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,166
this would take us by surprise.

390
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,791

Not so.

00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,708
That was a well-placed shot.

and slaughter us.

The enemy hopes for
the same thing we do--

426
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,666
to end this conflict
once and for all.
