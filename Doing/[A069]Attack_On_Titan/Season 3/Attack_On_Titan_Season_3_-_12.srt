1
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,375
[LEVI]
Guess what?

2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,250
This means we finally
have a real shot

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,250
at plugging the
hole in Wall Maria.

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,583
[gasps]

5
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,958
[ARMIN] The Scout Regiment
hurries its preparations

6
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,333
for the mission to
retake Wall Maria.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,458
[HANGE]
Ooh!

8
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:36,708
[BOTH gasp]

9
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,583
[HANGE]
Hell yeah!

10
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,333
We did it, Eren!

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,041
Eren?

12
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,208
[EREN]
I'm fine.

13
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,916
Let's just make these
weapons quickly,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,666
and then go to Shiganshina.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,375
[KENNY]
Seems if I just stick myself,

16
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,250
I'll turn into a big,
strong Titan.

17
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,958
[ARMIN]
Then came another surprise.

18
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,625
One more thing
with the potential

19
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,333
to shape the fate of humanity.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,875
Looks like I'm late. Sorry.

21
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,375
Have any luck?

22
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,208
Were you able to establish
what's in the container?

23
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,833
[HANGE] We have a vague
idea, but unfortunately,

24
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:23,208
with our technology, I'm afraid
we can't dig much deeper.

25
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,458
Like we've heard from
Eren and Historia,

26
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:29,500
it seems to originate from
some sort of human body fluid.

27
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,375
However, it vaporizes
when exposed to air,

28
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:37,083
making further analysis
virtually impossible to perform.

29
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,166
Whoever made it must
have had technology

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,833
far superior to ours.

31
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,708
I can't imagine how
the Reiss family

32
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,416
could've managed to do it.

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,166
[ZACHARY]
Hmm...

34
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,208
[PYXIS] In that case,
rather than tamper with it,

35
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,625
we should put it to use
for our current objective.

36
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,208
But to whom do we entrust it?

37
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,416
To you, Erwin?

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,291
No. With my wound,
I would be a poor choice.

39
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,375
This syringe, it belongs in
the hands of one of our elite.

40
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,166
Someone with the best
odds of survival.

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,416
Levi, will you accept it?

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,041
If it's an order, just say so.

43
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,333
Why even bother asking?

44
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:24,458
When we need to use this,
there may not be time to plan.

45
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,875
We'll be relying on you
to make a decision swiftly,

46
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,541
and with little deliberation.

47
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,666
Judging when to
use it, and on whom,

48
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,833
will be your responsibility.

49
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,250
Will you accept it?

50
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,541
If this dream of
yours comes true,

51
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,583
what will you do then?

52
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,250
[ERWIN]
I don't know, and I won't.

53
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,083
Not until it happens.

54
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,666
I see.

55
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,958
All right. I'll do it.

56
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,958
[ZACHARY]
Hmm...

57
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,750
Now then, I'd like to
discuss that work of mine.

58
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,833
As you know, I'm hoping
to unveil it soon.

59
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,500
Have you given it any thought?

60
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,958
You mean you still
haven't given up on that?

61
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,000
If the public were to see
such a repulsive display,

62
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,666
whatever trust they have in
the military would evaporate.

63
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,500
[ZACHARY] You don't know
art when you see it.

64
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:22,333
♪ Opening Song ♪

65
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,375
You spoke to Sadies,
and based on what he told you,

66
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,041
it seems that Grisha
Jaeger is a human

67
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,708
who came from outside the walls.

68
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:10,500
Yes, and like the others,
Annie, Reiner, and Bertholdt,

69
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,583
it appears he also had
the Power of the Titans.

70
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,208
But where those three
sought to undermine it,

71
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,916
he was supportive of
humanity within the walls.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,541
If he was really that supportive
of the Scouts and what we do,

73
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,875
maybe he coulda thrown a bit
more information our way.

74
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,083
[HANGE]
I wonder.

75
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,916
From the moment he
entered the walls,

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,958
he was searching for
the royal family.

77
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,000
A heavy burden to
shoulder alone.

78
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,291
If you ask me,

79
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,666
that's not something you do

80
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,041
unless you have an iron will
and incredible resolve.

81
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,750
And let's not forget,

82
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,791
that same man later wanted
to show his young son,

83
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,750
eager to join the Scouts,
something important.

84
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,333
Staring death in the face,

85
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:55,208
he said the truth of it all
was there, in the cellar.

86
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,583
What's down there?
What was he hiding?

87
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,291
[ERWIN]
Things which mustn't be said.

88
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,583
[ERWIN] No. Things
which can't be spoken.

89
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,250
Things he couldn't say,
even if he wanted to.

90
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,666
That which the First Reiss King
wiped from our consciousness.

91
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,750
Memories of our world.

92
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,666
At least, that's my hope.

93
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,333
But speculating more won't
accomplish anything.

94
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,166
The final preparations
are now complete.

95
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,708
The operation to retake
Wall Maria begins in two days.

96
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,125
Wanna know what's
in that cellar?

97
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,791
Let's go see for ourselves.

98
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,958
We're Scouts. That's what we do.

99
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,625
I'll leave it to you
to alert your squads.

100
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,666
[CLARK] Right. We'll keep
it quiet for now, though.

101
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,166
[HAROLD] I think our
troops deserve some meat

102
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,666
on a day like this.

103
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,125
[DIRK]
Good idea.

104
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,958
Gotta show those kids the
adults can be counted on.

105
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,750
What about Commandant Sadies

106
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,833
keeping important
secrets from us.

107
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:04,041
[HANGE] Forget it. We don't
have time to deal with that now.

108
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,791
[MARLENE]
You must be so disappointed.

109
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,166
You used to adore him!

110
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,666
[HANGE]
Shut up!

111
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,208
[ERWIN]
What is it, Levi?

112
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,750
This may sound impatient,

113
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:20,875
but what do you think you'll
do after retaking Wall Maria?

114
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,416
I'm guessing a defense plan
comes first, but after that?

115
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,083
What's next?

116
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,208
Eliminating threats.

117
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,833
Outside the walls,
there seems to be someone

118
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,583
hoping that Titans
will eat us all,

119
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,625
down to the last person.

120
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,416
As to who, well,
if we have any luck,

121
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,333
we'll find that answer
in the cellar.

122
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,833
A full plan will have to wait.

123
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,833
First we need to see
what's in that room.

124
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,416
You realize I'm asking this now

125
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,208
because you might
not live that long.

126
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,125
You're not exactly as
spry as you used to be.

127
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,916
Let Hange call the
shots on this mission.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,791
In your shape, you'll
only be dead weight.

129
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,166
You sit back and wait
for the good news.

130
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,500
We'll tell the others
I argued till you gave in.

131
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,250
Which I will, so why not make
this easier on both of us?

132
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,750
What do you say?

133
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,000
[ERWIN]
No.

134
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,666
Do what you need to.
Use me as bait.

135
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,416
The chain of command
still remains.

136
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,416
If I'm gone, then Hange.

137
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,250
If Hange's gone, the next.

138
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,791
It's true this operation
will be extremely dangerous,

139
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:39,166
but it will also be the most
important one in human history.

140
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,458
That's why I've gone
to such lengths.

141
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,708
This is my plan, Levi.

142
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,625
Without me leading you,
you're less likely to succeed.

143
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,708
That's true. Without you,
the operation might fail.

144
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:54,208
But if you bite the dust out
there, we're really screwed.

145
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,708
So just stay safe at your desk

146
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,416
and keep using
that head of yours.

147
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,083
As far as I'm concerned,

148
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,541
that's the last thing
the Titans would want,

149
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,875
and the best weapon
that humanity's got.

150
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,416
[ERWIN]
No, you're wrong.

151
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,416
Our best option is for
me to gamble it all

152
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,541
on the plan that I--

153
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,541
Okay, that's enough.
Stop right there.

154
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,916
Any more of those
noble-ass excuses,

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,583
and I'm gonna break
both your damn legs.

156
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,083
Not too badly.

157
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,083
They'll heal just fine, but
you'll be way too busted up

158
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:27,000
to even think about joining
us on the operation.

159
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,625
And it'll be a bitch
to get to the toilet.

160
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,250
[ERWIN chuckles]

161
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,875
Don't like that idea much.

162
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,666
Normally, I'd agree with you.

163
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,916
A wounded soldier should
stay off the battlefield.

164
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,500
However...

165
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,958
That may be the day we learn
the truth about our world,

166
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,875
and I'll be damned if
I'm going to miss it.

167
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,458
Being there is that important?

168
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,041
More than your legs?

169
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,833
Yes.

170
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,000
More than humanity's victory?

171
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,541
[ERWIN]
Yes.

172
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,333
I see.

173
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,375
Fine, Erwin.

174
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,291
In that case, I'll
trust your judgment.

175
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,916
[HAROLD]
This may be a special night,

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,166
but we don't need the
public knowing our plans.

177
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,625
So, behave like the
disciplined soldiers you are.

178
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,000
What? No way.

179
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,041
Is that...? It is.

180
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,125
It's meat.

181
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,291
[SASHA gasps]

182
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,666
Am I dreaming?

183
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,333
All right. Here's to the
re-taking of Wall Maria.

184
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:54,875
A toast!

185
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,041
[SOLDIERS cheer]

186
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,750
[HAROLD]
Huh? Wait!

187
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,000
Calm down! Everyone'll
get some, okay?

188
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,041
Hey! A piece that
big counts as two!

189
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,333
You're crazy!

190
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,833
Well, I'm worth two of
you on the battlefield,

191
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,708
so I think I should
get your portion!

192
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,125
Like hell!

193
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,458
What the hell do you think
you're doing, potato girl?

194
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,916
No way are we gonna
let you pull this shit!

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,375
Drop the meat, Sasha.

196
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,875
Come on, I really don't
wanna have to kill you.

197
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,916
You can't eat the whole
thing alone, you pig!

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,666
Ah! You're eating me!
My hand! My hand!

199
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,458
Sasha! That meat is Jean!

200
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,583
We don't eat our friends, okay?

201
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,166
[MARLO] What, does the Scout
Regiment never get any meat?

202
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,541
Really? That's just sad--

203
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,666
[MARLO grunts]

204
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,375
Conny, would you just
knock her out already?

205
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,958
I'm trying!

206
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,750
It's like her mind's shut down,
but she's still moving somehow!

207
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,250
[DIRK] Hey, I think
we've got casualties.

208
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,083
[HANGE] Whose brilliant idea
was it to serve meat, again?

209
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,875
[HAROLD] Well, I guess now
we know what happens

210
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,208
when we blow the whole food
budget for two months

211
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,416
on one night of celebrating.

212
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,333
[EREN]
That should do it.

213
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,875
[CONNY]
She finally wore herself out.

214
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,166
Jeez, can you
believe this freak?

215
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,916
It's crazy to think
that she once offered

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,416
to share meat with everybody.

217
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
What? She did?

218
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,208
Yeah, four months ago,

219
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,750
when we were
servicing the cannons.

220
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,583
I totally just helped myself
to the Officer's Pantry.

221
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,916
[ALL gasp]

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,791
[SASHA]
It'll be fine.

223
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,375
Just look at it this way.

224
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:25,750
Pretty soon, we'll take back all
the room we need for livestock.

225
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,208
[CONNY]
They're gonna get in.

226
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,833
They're gonna get in.
They're gonna get in!

227
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,708
[EREN]
He's gone!

228
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:42,333
[BERTHOLDT] In the moment,
I felt sorry for you.

229
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,458
[CONNY]
Hey.

230
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:51,000
It's hard to believe that
it's only been four months.

231
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,583
Yeah, it's kinda crazy.

232
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:56,375
But think, that's all it took
for us to make Levi Squad.

233
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,708
How's that for
climbin' the ranks?

234
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,250
[EREN] It's all because
you're a genius.

235
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,041
Damn straight I am.

236
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,375
[EREN] Come on. Let's eat
before it gets cold.

237
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,750
[SASHA yells]

238
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,791
[JEAN]
Don't you get it?

239
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,416
You've got no experience.

240
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,875
That's why you're in
the rear guard, rookie.

241
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,291
[MARLO]
I may be less knowledgeable

242
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,541
than the rest of you,

243
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,708
but isn't the vanguard
the best place to learn

244
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,208
how the enemy moves?

245
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,791
What's this?

246
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,333
You think that you can lecture
a veteran about self-sacrifice?

247
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,541
Isn't that what
makes us effective?

248
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,125
Being willing to put
ourselves in harm's way?

249
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,541
Listen, everyone starts
out as a recruit, okay?

250
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,583
If we throw recruits into
battle like cannon fodder,

251
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,833
then they'll all be
too dead to learn.

252
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,083
And that's why, for now,

253
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,333
it's your job to watch
and learn from the rear.

254
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,083
So you can make it
back in one piece.

255
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,458
The ones who really suck
are the suicidal maniacs

256
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,916
who think the only way to
fight is to charge in blind.

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,291
Right?

258
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,750
Are you talkin' about
somebody in particular?

259
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,791
Yeah, I'm looking right
at him. Suicidal maniac.

260
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,541
You see, the funny thing is
that I recently discovered

261
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,708
that I'm actually a
pretty normal person.

262
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,750
So, hey, if that's how
you really see me,

263
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,750
then maybe you're just
a coward, Jean.

264
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,125
Right?

265
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,500
You think you're so cool,
don't you, you piece of shit?

266
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,125
That's a pretty
shaggy-looking mane

267
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,916
you're growing
there, horse face!

268
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,291
What's with those two?

269
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,875
Try not to kill each other.

270
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:24,875
You jerk!

271
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:25,958
[EREN]
You're gonna rip my shirt!

272
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,541
What the hell are
those two doing?

273
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,375
[JEAN]
You bastard!

274
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,791
[SOLDIER 49A]
Show 'em what you've got!

275
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,375
[SOLDIER 49B]
He's losing ground!

276
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,333
It looks like we've
got a fight.

277
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,000
I told the idiots to behave.

278
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,875
But seriously.

279
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,000
If you didn't have Titan powers,
you'd be dead ten times over.

280
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,375
Although, I guess Mikasa
would've swooped in every time

281
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,583
to save your worthless ass.

282
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,750
You so eager to die?

283
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,875
Fine, then I'll kill you!

284
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,791
Yeah? Okay.

285
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,750
Give it your best shot!

286
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,458
You oughta start
showin' your mom

287
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,125
some more respect, Jean-boy!

288
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,583
Would you forget that?

289
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,166
Never!

290
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,458
Should we let them keep going?

291
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,458
[EREN]
Stupid horse face!

292
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,916
I think it's fine.

293
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,666
[EREN, JEAN panting]

294
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,041
[EREN]
Why?

295
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,208
Why isn't anybody stopping us?

296
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,541
[JEAN]
How long's this gonna go on?

297
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,791
Shit. I think I'm gonna
barf up that meat.

298
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:38,500
[LEVI]
Hey.

299
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,458
[LEVI, JEAN groaning]

300
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,291
[LEVI]
That's enough celebrating.

301
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,041
Go to bed.

302
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,458
[JEAN retches]

303
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,791
And clean that up.

304
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,500
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

305
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,208
[SASHA yelling]

306
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,916
[EREN]
Ahh...

307
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,666
I can't believe I'm saying this,

308
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,916
but shouldn't you guys
watch out for me more?

309
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,666
[ARMIN] Considering how
quickly you heal,

310
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,375
I wasn't especially
worried about it.

311
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,625
Some friends you are.

312
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,375
Look, you started it,
so don't complain.

313
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,791
[ARMIN] Plus, it's good
to see you feisty again.

314
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,208
I'm glad we met
with the commandant.

315
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,041
I think it helped.

316
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:30,041
I don't know about being feisty,
but I'll do what I have to.

317
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:34,041
And honestly, I feel better.

318
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:38,500
I just kept thinking about all
the stuff I couldn't change.

319
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,458
Spent so much time
pitying myself,

320
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,250
wondering why I couldn't be
strong like Mikasa and Levi.

321
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:49,833
I was jealous, but even
though you guys are strong,

322
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,250
you can't do all
that much alone.

323
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,083
None of us can.

324
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,916
That's why we have to
find our own roles.

325
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,958
When we join together,

326
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:04,333
that's when we become
truly powerful.

327
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,625
Everyone's got their
own strengths,

328
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,416
and it's 'cause of
times like this.

329
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,458
[ARMIN]
Yeah.

330
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,583
I think you're right.

331
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,375
Once we've retaken Wall Maria

332
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,666
and defeated every last
one of our enemies...

333
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,958
...can we go back?

334
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,958
To how things used to be?

335
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,083
[EREN]
Some things will be the same,

336
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,916
but some things have
changed forever.

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,708
And we'll make them
pay for that.

338
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,541
Yeah.

339
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,916
There's more out there, though.

340
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,666
The sea. Remember?

341
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,166
A body of water so big

342
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,875
that merchants could
spend their whole lives

343
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,333
and still not get
all the salt out.

344
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:23,416
There's so much beyond
the walls. Not just Titans.

345
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,416
Water that glows like
fire, fields of ice,

346
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,666
giant rocks that
take days to climb.
