00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,791
Let's go. Take them
deeper into the woods

175
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,791
and tie them up, Sasha.

176
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,291
[SASHA]
Sir!

177
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,916
Hey, Captain.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,166
Would you let me do it instead?

179
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,333
[LEVI]
Knock yourself out.

180
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,416
All right.

181
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,083
[MARLO] We'll forget
everything we saw here.

182
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,541
I know ya will. Because both
of you are about to die!

183
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,416
Ah! No! He said to let us go!

184
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,000
The captain might be
a big softie, but I'm not.

185
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,458
I'm ready to do
what needs to be done.

186
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,041
You have to believe us!
We won't betray you--

187
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,750
we know that you're fighting
to protect humanity!

188
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,583
Right? Tell him!

189
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,625
As if I'd take your word for it.

190
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,291
I can't trust you--
not with that hair.

191
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,250
Who in their right mind
would get a bowl cut on purpose?

192
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,958
So how can I trust
a single word you say?

193
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,541
--[HITCH, MARLO yell]
--[JEAN] Uh!

194
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,958
[MARLO]
Run, Hitch. I'll cover you!

195
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,958
[HITCH screams]

196
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,166
What do you think'll
kill faster?

197
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,416
That knife,
or the gun at your chin?

198
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,291
Feel like tryin' your luck?
C'mon, let's race!

199
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,875
Please. We're on
the same side here!

200
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,416
Why the hell
would anyone believe

201
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,041
you wanna join the Scouts?

202
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,958
My comrades are getting rounded
up like criminals as we speak--

203
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,166
What makes you think we can win?

204
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,916
Because. You haven't quit.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,875
Despite the odds,
the Scouts are still fighting.

206
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,416
I made a mistake when
I chose my regiment.

207
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,916
But you're a Scout.

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,708
You chose to risk
your lives for others.

209
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,583
So I'll trust you.

210
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,458
--[HITCH yells]
--[JEAN groans]

211
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,541
What the--?

212
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,958
Horse-faced jerk!

213
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,541
[MARLO] Stop! He was
just trying to test us!

214
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,541
[HITCH gasps]

215
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,000
[HITCH]
Huh?

216
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,791
Are you crazy?
Even with my hands bound,

217
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,583
I could've taken a swing
at you with that knife

218
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,500
and done some real damage.

219
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,458
How did you know
I wouldn't do it?

220
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:24,291
Don't ask me how, but you
remind me of this annoying guy.

221
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,166
An idiot.

222
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,416
Makes me wonder.
Is he one of the fools

223
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,166
Annie told me about?

224
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,791
Couldn't say.

225
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,041
All of us are fools.

226
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,125
[JEAN] Luckily for me,
you're just as dumb.

227
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,625
Marlo, I think you
proved your dedication.

228
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,375
[gasps]

229
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,708
This should be enough
to convince Captain Levi.

230
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,500
We'll be counting on you
from here on out.

231
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,750
[MARLO]
Far as I know,

232
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,458
this is the least-manned
checkpoint in the region.

233
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,291
Good. We'll handle
things from here.

234
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,500
Get back to your squad
before they're suspicious.

235
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,958
[HITCH, MARLO]
Right.

236
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,333
[LEVI]
Marlo, Hitch.

237
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,000
We're grateful.

238
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,541
[MARLO, HITCH]
Sir!

239
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,958
All right. This time
we're picking the fight.

[SOLDIER 41C groans]

247
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,333
Captain. Isn't he--?

248
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,708
[LEVI]
He's with the Interior Police.

249
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,625
I've got questions for him.

250
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,250
Let's move.

251
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,875

[ALL chuckling]

253
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,291
[ROGER] Thanks, dumbass.
There won't be any witnesses

254
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,666
in an abandoned dump like this.

255
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,541
Damn it!

256
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,166
I owe you big time.
Thanks a bunch, Flegel.

257
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,000
I mean, when you
gave us the slip before--

258
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:37,500
back in that alley--
I really thought I was screwed!

259
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:42,291
[sobbing]

260
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,958
My boss would've
killed me. I'm serious.

261
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,208
[chuckles]

262
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,000
Thanks for comin' back,
Flegel. Nice knowin' ya.

263
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,416
No! Wait.
Don't shoot yet, please!

264
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,166
Why did my father have to die?

265
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,041
Did the Interior Police
kill him?

266
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,625
What? I don't see
how that matters to you.

267
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,083
After all, you're about to be
a corpse yourself in a moment.

268
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,750
Please! Before I die,
I wanna know.

269
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,583
What did my father do
for you to justify killing him?

270
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,500
Huh? I thought you'd know.

271
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,291
He betrayed us
and started helping out

272
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,541
those bastards
in the Scout Regiment.

273
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:20,041
So his orders--they came
from the Interior Police?

274
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,250
You guys had him
kidnap those Scouts?

275
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,916
Well, it was a
different squad, but yeah.

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Guess old Dimo didn't say
too much about it.

277
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,875
At least not to his
dimwit excuse for a son.

278
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,666
[FLEGEL] And what if
he'd refused to do it?

279
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,291
[ROGER]
Oh, he knew way too much.

280
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,875
We'd've killed him. I mean,
we killed him anyway,

281
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,666
but that's what he gets.
The damn idiot.

282
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,291
What made him think
the Survey Corps

283
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,958
could help this trash city?

284
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:49,458
[FLEGEL sighs]
You would never understand.

285
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,958
[ROGER]
Hmm?

286
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,500
You think you're real
smart shit, don't you?

287
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,375
Wanna know the last thing
my dad taught me?

288
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,875
He said a good merchant
should trust his nose.

289
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,250
And I'm glad I listened,

290
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,958
because it lead me to the people
who could avenge him.

291
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,791
And I side with them!

292
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,666

is over, asshole!

are here? But why?

as it used to be,
but it's still our home.

308

We heard everything.

309
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,541
About Reiss.
And who had him killed.

310

is a witness.

for a second

you can get away with this!

You can't win.
All that's left to you now

346
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,208
is to find some
filthy corner to hide in!

347
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,125
Covered in mud and shit!

348
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,916
If you don't turn yourselves in,

349
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,875
then every last Scout
we captured will get the noose!

350
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:49,416
Starting with the guiltiest
one of all, Erwin Smith!

Hurts, right?
That's what you get

353
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,250
for not answering my question.

354
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,375
Some Scout's lives are
more valuable than others.

355
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:04,375
Only those dumb enough
to agree to that join us.

356
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,125
Again, where'd they take
Eren and Christa?

357
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,875
I-I don't know.
Nobody told me, I swear!

358
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,875
Kenny Ackermann doesn't like
to make his business known!

359
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,291
Ackermann?

[MIKASA gasps]

361
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,041
I know Kenny.
That his last name?

362
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,416
[SOLDIER 41C]
It is, but--

363
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,125
He never was much of one
for sharing information.

364
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,666
Not important stuff, anyway.

365
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,000
But I bet you have
a rough idea.

366
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,875
You'd best try to remember.

367
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,250
No. Stop!

368
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,583
You still have plenty of
bones left for me to break.

369
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:40,250
Damn it. Are you insane?

370
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,041
Maybe.

371
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,791
Somebody's coming towards us!

372
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,833
And there's more than one.

373
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,250
Told you. You're beat.
Struggle all you want.

374
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:58,708
One way or another, the Survey
Corps will be destroyed.

[NILE]
You've seen better days.

376
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,166
Kinda funny. You were lecturing
me just the other day.

377
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,333
Soon, you'll be sent
before the king.

378
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,666
Then, his council will
determine your sentence,

379
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,416
and what to do
with the Survey Corps.

380
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,916

So you came.

Tell me Nile, where do you live?

383

Stohess, was it?

384
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,208
How's Marie?

385
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,833
How are your children?

386
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,250
I trust they're
all in good health.

387
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,208
Marie and the kids are--
They should be just fine.

388
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,375
I haven't been home in a while,

389
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,333
but it's in Wall Rose
on the east side.

390
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,166
I see.

391
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:00,125
Why ask that? What's going on?

392
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:04,125
[ERWIN] I entrusted something
to Commander Pyxis.

393
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:08,583
Whenever that
crucial moment comes,

394
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,750
what happens next
is out of my hands.

395
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:16,291
It'll be your choice to make.
Yours and theirs.

396
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,625
[DELTOFF] So, what did we learn
from the interrogation?

397
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,791
[GERALD] Not much. Erwin didn't
even realize that Pastor Nick

398
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,333
was with the Order of the Walls,

399
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,375
so Historia can make
all the claims about her name

400
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,250
she wants and it won't matter.

401
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,166
They'll all amount to nothing.

402
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,583
What a farce.

403
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,416
They don't know it, but in
truth they're nothing more

404
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,458
than cattle in a pen;
simply waiting to die.

Very well. We'll be along.

Once Erwin has been executed,
all will be according to plan.

The secrets of the walls
will be kept as safe as ever.

will be ensured.

In order to protect the kingdom,

they kept the truth of the

But in doing so, they invited
an uprising of the people.
