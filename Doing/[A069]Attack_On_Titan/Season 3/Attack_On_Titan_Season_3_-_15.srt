The best explanation is
that it's someone like Eren.

00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,541

Bet you thought that
by bringing up Annie,

325
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,916
you could make me lose
my cool, like last time.

326
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,541
You thought I was still the
timid fool you once knew,

00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,375
and that you could trick me
into letting my guard down!

Stay back, Eren.

I know what this is.

You're just buying
time, aren't you?

00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,208
Half your comrades'll
surround me.

And while I'm distracted,

338
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,416
the rest'll go and
finish killing Reiner.

00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,916
I can tell I'm right.

Look at the way you're shaking.

You're scared outta
your mind, aren't you?

00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,541
If you knew that much,

343
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,791
then why're you talking
to me in the first place?

344
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,250
Because I needed to know...

345
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,458
...if when I faced
all of you this time,

346
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,541
I'd start crying and beg you to
put me out of my misery again.

But...

right up until I've killed you.

But why?

352
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,416
Do you actually believe that
we're the spawn of the devil?

353
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
[BERTHOLDT]
No.

354
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,625
None of you did anything wrong.

Don't do it. We can't chase him.

There's no telling when
he'll choose to transform.

If we don't keep our distance,

we'll just get caught
in the explosion.

[ARMIN] I don't think Bertholdt
intends to do that just yet.

He must've seen how badly
wounded Reiner is.

Transforming now would
probably kill him.

Our best bet is to
take Reiner hostage

with our blades.

That'd make sense, but...
