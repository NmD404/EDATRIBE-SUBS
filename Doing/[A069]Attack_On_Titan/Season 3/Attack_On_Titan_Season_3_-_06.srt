00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,630
I’ll take you out once a week
to be paraded to the public.

176
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,370
It’s so beautiful.
This may well be the finest

177
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,010
work of art man has
ever conceived.

178
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,640
All those decades of planning it
have finally paid off.

179
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,950
Just wait. Art must be
completed by its audience.

180
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,720
You must be seen by the people,
the same ones you tyrannized.

181
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,650
And that will be my masterpiece.

182
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,820
[AURILLE] Zachary!
You’ll pay for this tenfold.

183
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,860
The blood of slaves
runs through your veins,

184
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,420
and nothing’ll change that!

185
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,690
You will never be the
equal of a noble like me.

186
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,760
[groans]

187
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,930
Soon enough, you’ll forget
any of this happened.

188
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,170
I bet you’ll even
forget how to shit!

189
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,870
As long as we’re on the subject,

190
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,440
why don’t you tell me if
you nobles really do shit gold?

191
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,210
I’m sorry, what was that?
Your mouth’s full!

192
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,110
[PYXIS]
This could end badly.

193
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,950
All the members
of the king’s council

194
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,780
are telling us the same thing.

195
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,250
It’s just as your
late father speculated.

196
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,820
The Reiss family has the power

197
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,820
to alter people’s memories
as it suits them.

198
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,020
From what I’ve been told,

199
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,060
aside from those of a few noble
bloodlines that’re immune,

200
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,160
whole cities could be
affected at once.

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,200
[gasps]
So they could still--

202
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,840
In the event that Lord Reiss is
able to obtain Eren’s "Scream,"

203
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,840
this uprising of ours will
amount to absolutely nothing.

204
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,380
If you ask me, that’s why
the council members

205
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,410
have been so cooperative.

206
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,350
They don’t think it’s
worth getting beaten.

207
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,880
[ERWIN] Right. Because if this
ability should come into play,

208
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,450
we’ll forget
everything they told us.

209
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,160
Although, I’d imagine
that they’d prefer

210
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,430
whatever torture
we could throw at them

211
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,190
if they knew
what would await them

212
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,860
once they’re
given up to Zachary.

213
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,760
I don’t understand him.

214
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,330
To think that he would
dedicate so much

215
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,970
of his life to such
a morbid goal.

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,870
So then, you knew
what he was planning?

217
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,410
[PYXIS] Mmm. ’Twas a
slip of the tongue.

218
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
I suspected.

219
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,110
At the very least I knew
his motives were perverse.

220
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,880
And unlike you, I’m none
too fond of gambling.

221
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,490
Also, unlike you...

222
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,820
...I’m willing to die
if it means protecting

223
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,860
what’s left of humanity.

224
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,830
The only reason I backed you
was because I believed it

225
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,970
to be the best choice
for the human race.

226
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,900
Had the government
passed my little test,

227
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:34,310
I was prepared to make a stand
against you and Zachary.

228
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,980
To think, we just stood
as comrades in a coup d’état,

229
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,450
and I’m already
talking like this.

230
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,350
I once heard in a
song that someday

231
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,880
humans would stop fighting.

232
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,850
When will that be?

233
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,160
[MALE SOLDIER 43A] Commander!
The wagons are ready, sir.

234
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,060
Troops are standing by.

235
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,930
We await your command.

236
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,230
Peace between men
will never be certain.

237
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,400
Not until our numbers
fall to one or less.

238
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,430
[PYXIS chuckles]
Shit.

239
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,470
Here I was hoping you might have
something optimistic to say.

240
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,210
[ERWIN]
Your attention!

241
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,180
Soldiers of the Survey Corps,

242
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,050
our mission is to recover
Eren and Historia.

243
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,810
We will now
make for their location,

244
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,350
believed to be the chapel
on Reiss’ land!

245
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,260
[LEVI] You should understand.
This is Kenny the Ripper.

246
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,290
If he’s there,
he’s our biggest obstacle.

247
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,000
In terms of his threat level,
it’s like you’ll be fighting me.

248
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,370
Or wait. With those weapons
of his, he’ll be stronger.

249
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,170
Then he’s unbeatable.
At least for us.

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,500
Maybe we should wait and
meet up with other soldiers.

251
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,040
No chance in hell.

252
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,840
Right. Course not.

253
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,880
If we wait for reinforcements,
then Eren might get eaten.

254
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,050
You know, based on what
the captain just told us,

255
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,480
the odds won’t be
entirely in Kenny’s favor.

256
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,450
--You really think so?
--Yeah. His squad is

257
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,090
well-trained, but we have
way more combat experience.

258
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,290
Have to ask. How is it
that you lived with

259
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,890
Kenny the Ripper but know
next to nothing about him?

260
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,460
Did the two of you never talk?

261
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,030
Not much. I only just learned
the man’s last name.

262
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,500
Dunno if you heard,
but it’s Ackermann.

263
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,100
Might be a relative of yours.

264
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,570
[gasps]

265
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,580
I remember my parents
saying that

266
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,450
my dad’s side, the Ackermanns,

267
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,220
were persecuted when
they lived in the cities.

268
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,120
My mom said her
ancestors were eastern.

269
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,590
Her family’s appearance made it
difficult for them to fit in.

270
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,430
Both groups were chased
deep in the mountains

271
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,930
near the edge of the walls.
That’s how my parents met.

272
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,160
But my father never told me

273
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
why the Ackermanns
were persecuted.

274
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,240
He looked the same
as all of you,

275
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,170
so I don’t think
he was of a different race.

276
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,380
Tell me this:
Have you ever suddenly felt

277
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,250
a "power" awaken inside you?

278
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,080
[gasps]

279
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,990
I have.

280
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,530
[LEVI] This has happened
for Kenny Ackermann as well.

281
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,500
Suddenly, out of nowhere,
he felt an absurd

282
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,340
amount of strength
surging through him.

283
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,670
And in that moment, he knew
just what he needed to do.

284
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,410
And it’s happened to me too.
Makes me wonder.

285
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,360
[KENNY]
Fess up, Gramps.

286
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,130
C’mon. You’re dyin’ anyway.

287
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,240
Ah, Kenny. I take it
you were just out

288
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,070
killin’ more of
the Military Police.

289
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,540
[KENNY] Yeah. If you’re
talkin’ about those goons

290
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,240
what were snoopin’ around here,

291
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,710
they’re in the ground
helping the trees grow now.

292
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,350
[coughing]

293
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,350
Speakin’ of trees and such,

294
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,350
there’s a branch of the family
that moved south to Shiganshina.

295
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,360
Guess they should’a changed
the name when they left,

296
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,320
’cause they’re still
gettin’ screwed with.

297
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,290
So of course,
they’re still poor as dirt.

298
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,600
What in the hell happened to us?

299
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,130
I thought that
the Ackermann clan

300
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,700
used to be the king’s
personal bodyguards.

301
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,140
Now the whole damn family’s
on the verge of extinction.

302
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,040
So why don’t you tell me what
you did to piss off the king?

303
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,310
C’mon, won’t ya tell your
sweet grandson one last story?

304
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,150
[KENNY’S GRANDPA coughs]

305
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,020
What sweet grandson
are you talkin’ about?

306
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,290
Surely not the infamous
"Kenny the Ripper"

307
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,430
who’s been
terrorizin’ the capital.

308
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,600
It ain’t that the monarchy
hates us or has any cause to.

309
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,170
They’re just
afraid of us, is all.

310
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,800
Reason bein’ we Ackermann’s
are one of a few families

311
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,540
the king can’t quite control.

312
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,680
What do you mean by that?

313
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,310
[KENNY’S GRANDPA]
Can’t tell ya the whole story,

314
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,150
’cause I don’t know it.

315
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,650
But it’s true that
our family was once

316
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,320
honored and trusted by the king.

317
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,650
More than that,
from what I was told,

318
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,320
we Ackermanns were once
the king’s sword.

319
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
For generations,
each king has passed

320
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,530
the Power of the Titans
to his successor.

321
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,130
Huh? Power of the Titans?
What’s that?

322
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,400
[KENNY’S GRANDPA]
I don’t know how it works,

323
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,140
or what all else there is to it,

324
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,700
but this power allows the king

325
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,770
to wipe out human memory.
To erase the past.

326
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,080
Only a few noble
bloodlines are immune.

327
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,250
Among them, there were
two groups that decided

328
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,080
to turn their back on the king.

329
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,220
One of these groups
was the Eastern clan,

330
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,350
and the other was
our own Ackermann clan.

331
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,260
Hence all the persecution.

332
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,460
And nothing can end it.

333
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,460
[coughing]

334
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,330
[KENNY] Ain’t the heartwarming
story you wanna hear

335
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,800
on your deathbed,
but I found my little sister.

336
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,110
Kuchel’s been working at
a brothel in the underground.

337
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,210
She got knocked up
by a customer.

338
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,540
I couldn’t convince her
to get rid of the thing.

339
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,210
[coughs]

340
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,650
[KENNY] Oh, hell.
Who’d wanna be born into this

341
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,650
piece of shit world, anyway?

342
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,350
There isn’t a dream you could
have worth sufferin’ through it.

00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,630
[HANGE]
Found it. A hidden door.

344
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,230
Reiss and Eren
should be inside.

345
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,230
Hopefully the layout’s
close to what I predicted.

346
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,240
[LEVI]
These presents better pay off.

347
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,670
Considering the time
we spent prepping them.

348
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,510
[CAVEN]
We count at least seven enemies,

349
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,580
and you can bet
Captain Levi’s among them.

350
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,520
As you all know, last time
we caught Levi by surprise.

351
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,320
And then he killed
twelve of our comrades.

352
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,190
The government’s
been overthrown,

353
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,160
which means
we’re the fugitives now.

354
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,900
So I wouldn’t count on
getting any backup.

355
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,530
We’re in some deep shit.

356
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,730
In this tiny, screwed-up world,

357
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,870
dying is preferable
to what we would get

358
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
if we decided to surrender.

359
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,640
But here’s the thing:
That’s what life in the walls

360
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,410
has always been.
Nothing’s changed.

361
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,450
We’ve got a foe we can’t beat.

362
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,950
So we stand by and wait

363
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,890
for them to break through
our walls and kill us.

364
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,890
We fought to be Military Police,
and then Interior Police.

365
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,860
And now we’re Kenny’s elites.

366
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,360
We did this to find purpose
in our meaningless lives

367
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,230
in this meaningless world.

368
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,870
I see no cause
to stop believing now.

369
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,200
If Kenny and his dream
can’t turn this game around,

370
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,740
he’ll flip the board.

371
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,410
’Kay. We should be
ready to go now.

372
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,410
All right then.
Is everyone here ready?

373
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,220
’Cause you’re all about
to dirty your hands.
