181
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,916
[MIKASA gasps]
Eren's not moving.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,500
He's still alive, though.

183
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,250
Focus on keeping
Bertholdt off him.

184
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,916
That might have been
pushing it too far.

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,750
That's what'll happen if we
charge at him without a plan.

186
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,041
Now what?

187
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,625
Unless we can turn
the tables somehow,

188
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,708
this operation will fail,

189
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,041
all of us will die,

190
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,666
and eventually,
humanity will fall.

191
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, screw it then.

192
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,833
Plan or no, I'm not
just gonna sit around

193
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,416
and wait to get slaughtered.

194
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,041
Let's take the fight
to him! [grunts]

195
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,083
[BOTH grunt]

196
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,625
[JEAN] He doesn't know about
the Thunder Spears yet!

197
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,791
Sasha and Conny will
help me distract him!

198
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,750
Mikasa, you go for the kill!

199
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,791
[CONNY, MIKASA, SASHA]
Right!

200
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,500
Hey, freak-show!

201
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,125
You forget your skin somewhere?

202
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,041
You look so gross!

203
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,416
No one wants to see
all that, ya pervert!

204
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,958
[JEAN] This distraction
is way too obvious.

205
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,041
But we only need one good hit.

206
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,666
[MIKASA grunts]

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,666
[MIKASA gasps]

208
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,541
[JEAN grunts]

209
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,583
[gasps]

210
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,750
[MIKASA groans]

211
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,208
[BOTH grunt]

212
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,708
[JEAN, SASHA, CONNY yell]

213
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,750
[ARMIN]
Guys!

214
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,333
[ARMIN]
Is there nothing we can do?

215
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,666
That steam even knocked away
the Thunder Spears mid-flight.

216
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,416
[coughing]

217
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,666
Conny!

218
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,708
Damn it. I breathed some
in and burned my throat.

219
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:02,583
[MIKASA grunts]

220
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,375
[ARMIN]
Mikasa! You're hurt!

221
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,833
It isn't bad.

222
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,458
A bit of shrapnel from
the Thunder Spears got me.

223
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,833
Figured something out yet?

224
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,083
Huh?

225
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,500
Tell me. Is there a way
that we can fight back?

226
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,458
[gasps]

227
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,125
[ARMIN]
I don't know.

228
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,291
[ALL gasp]

229
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:31,333
[ALL gasping]

230
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,791
[SCOUTS yelling, sobbing]

231
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,625
[LEVI] This place is gonna look
like a honeycomb before long.

232
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,791
The Beast Titan
knows where we are.

233
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,416
Erwin.

234
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,708
If there's no chance that we can
turn this around then tell me,

235
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,791
and we can still cut our losses.

236
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,625
Go shake the shit out of
Eren till he wakes up.

237
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,875
Have him run away with as
many people as he can carry.

238
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,166
Then we'll have at
least some survivors.

239
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,791
[SCOUTS yelling, sobbing]

240
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,083
[MARLO] It's our job
to guard the horses!

241
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,791
Why'd you let yours run away?

242
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,833
Shut up!

243
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,291
Like it even matters now.

244
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,041
What was that?

245
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,916
Those other scouts
were insanely strong

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,166
and all of them
died in an instant!

247
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,750
What chance do we have
where they failed?

248
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,583
There's no reason
to guard the horses.

249
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,291
Because there's not gonna be
anyone left to ride them home!

250
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:44,833
[SCOUTS gasping, murmuring]

251
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,541
There was a point when
it all made sense.

252
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,291
If everyone just cowered
behind the walls and waited,

253
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:54,208
then someday Titans would come
out of nowhere and wipe us out.

254
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,833
It was obvious that
someone needed to

255
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,750
bite the bullet and fight.

256
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,333
It would be dangerous, yeah,

257
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,750
but the soldiers who did it
would be risking their lives

258
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,458
to protect their loved ones.

259
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,416
So when the recruiter asked us,

260
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,458
"Which of you has the courage?"

261
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,000
I actually thought
I could do it.

262
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,541
Thought I'd be some kinda hero.

263
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,958
I didn't get it.

264
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,458
I didn't know.

265
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,833
I thought that if I died,

266
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,583
it would at least have some
meaning... but it won't.

267
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,791
It didn't for the others.
They're just gone.

268
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,375
You know what?

269
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,833
I bet almost everyone ends up
having that same final thought.

270
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,625
I was so stupid for coming here.

271
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,291
Why did I think
I'd be different?

272
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,708
[FLOCH sobbing]

273
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,750
You could tell what's left of
the recruits and Hange's group

274
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,375
to run away on horseback.

275
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:50,333
They won't have much of a
chance, but they'll be decoys.

276
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,333
They can give Eren
a shot at escaping.

277
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,416
Tell me.

278
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,583
How would you fit
into this plan?

279
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,625
I'm gonna go after
the Beast Titan.

280
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,250
I'll draw him away somehow and--

281
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,583
You can't.

282
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,083
You won't even make it near him.

283
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,916
Probably not.

284
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,958
But, if you and Eren
make it home alive,

285
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,833
then there will still be hope.

286
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,041
All things considered,

287
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,250
I feel like that's the
best we can ask for.

288
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,666
We've been brutalized.

289
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,291
To be honest, sir,

290
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,791
it seems like this
battle will be

291
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,875
where the Scout Regiment
gets finished off.

292
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,291
Yes.

293
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,458
If we had no way to fight back,
then you would be right.

294
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,666
[gasps]

295
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,416
Is there a way?

296
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,416
There is.

297
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,708
[LEVI] You could've
mentioned that before.

298
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,083
Care to explain why you
kept your shitty mouth shut?

299
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,125
The plan could go a few ways.

300
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,125
Best case, you'll have
a decent chance of

301
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,000
killing the Beast Titan.

302
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:51,250
But for it to succeed...
the recruits and I have to die.

303
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:56,250
[SCOUTS screaming]

304
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,666
The Survey Corps may survive.

305
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,791
But regardless,
most of us will end up dead.

306
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:07,541
Frankly, we're almost guaranteed
to be defeated, no matter what.

307
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,625
The recruits and I will
be staking our deaths

308
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,833
on the slimmest
chance of victory.

309
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,291
[ERWIN]
For this to work--

310
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,166
to convince these youths to
charge toward their deaths--

311
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,625
it would take an expert con man

312
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,000
and a whole slew
of blatant lies.

313
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,208
[ERWIN] If I don't lead
the vanguard myself,

314
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,333
then none of them will
have the courage.

315
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,500
Which means I must be
the first to charge.

316
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,000
And the first to
be slain as well.

317
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,916
So I'll never learn the truth.

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,125
Huh?

319
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,708
[sighs]

320
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:49,208
I just... wanted to
reach that cellar.

321
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,958
Everything I've done
up to this point,

322
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,708
I did in the hopes that
this chance would come.

323
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,666
I dreamt... that I'd
get to prove I was right.

324
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,791
[ERWIN]
Many times,

325
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,916
I thought that death would've
been easier, but then I...

326
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,083
I think of the questions
I needed answered.

327
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,916
They're what I lived for.

328
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,291
And now those answers are no
more than a coward's leap away.

329
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,750
[ERWIN]
I'm so close, but...

330
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,000
Can you see them, too?

331
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,041
Our comrades. They're
all standing around us.

332
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,291
They've been watching
us all this time.

333
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,500
They want to know what we did

334
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,416
with the sacrifices
that they made...

335
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,916
What became of the
hearts they gave...

336
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,375
[SCOUTS screaming]

337
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,083
But that's probably
just in my head, right?

338
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,125
Of no more import than
a child's bad dream.

339
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,958
[LEVI]
You led us well.

340
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,541
Fought hard.

341
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,958
No one else could've
gotten us this far.

342
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,083
I'll make the choice for you.

343
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,791
Give up on your dream
and charge to your death.

344
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,041
Lead those crying children
straight to hell.

345
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,458
I'll reach the Beast
Titan and tear him apart.

346
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
[gasps]

347
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,041
--[SCOUTS yelling]

348
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,458
--Huh?
--[SCOUTS yelling]

349
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,375
--[SCOUTS yelling]

350
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,958
[ERWIN]
Charge!

351
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,958
[ERWIN yells]

352
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,208
Huh.

353
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,916
I didn't expect them to
lay down and die, but...

354
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,291
A suicide charge?

355
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:05,125
For some reason I thought
they'd do better than that.

356
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,083
All right. Fire!

357
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,583
Is that smoke?

358
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,583
Oh, it's from those
signal guns they use.

359
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,541
Incoming. Spread out!

360
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,625
[SCOUTS yelling]

361
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,375
I'm about to announce
our final mission.

362
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,708
All troops, line up!

363
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,291
[SCOUTS gasp]

364
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,458
[ERWIN] We're going to
mount a cavalry charge,

365
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,500
rushing the Beast
Titan directly.

366
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,166
Clearly, this will make
us ideal targets for him.

367
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,833
So we'll wait until the
moment he's ready to throw,

368
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,291
and then we'll fire our
smoke signals together.

369
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,791
That should somewhat
reduce his accuracy.

370
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,708
While we distract
the Beast Titan,

371
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,041
Captain Levi will get in
position to dispatch it.

372
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,791
Does anyone have questions?

373
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,125
[LEVI]
What?

374
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,291
You want me to go after
him with just ODM gear?

375
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,500
He's standing in the
middle of a field.

376
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,625
I can't fight without a
house or tree to hook on.

377
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,958
You're wrong.

378
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,250
Huh?

379
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,750
[ERWIN] There happens
to be a line of objects

380
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,166
at just the right height
for your approach.

381
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,791
[ERWIN] Use his thralls
to advance unseen...

382
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,083
[LEVI grunts]

383
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,708
[ERWIN] ...and assassinate
the son of a bitch.

384
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,875
[LEVI grunts]

385
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:26,250
[SCOUTS yelling]

386
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,750
[LEVI]
I'm sorry.

387
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:35,250
[SANDRA gags, vomits]

388
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,041
There's no point
standing around.

389
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,625
We'll only be showered
by more boulders.

390
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,583
Ready your horses,
on the double!

391
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,833
Be honest.

392
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:48,458
Are all of us...
riding to our deaths?

393
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,333
Yes, we are.

394
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,750
And since we're dying anyway,

395
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,708
you're saying that
it's better...

396
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,125
...if we at least die fighting?

397
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,750
I am.

398
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:03,708
But wait, if we'll die anyway,
then who cares what we do?

399
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,125
We could just disobey
your orders...

400
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,083
...and it wouldn't mean
a thing, would it?

401
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,625
Yes, you're precisely right.

402
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,041
[gasps]

403
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,041
Everything that you
thought had meaning--

404
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,583
every hope, dream,
or moment of happiness--

405
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,541
None of it matters as
you lie, bleeding out,

406
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,708
on the battlefield.

407
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,875
None of it changes what a
speeding rock does to a body.

408
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,333
We all die.

409
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,166
[ERWIN] But does that mean
our lives are meaningless?

410
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,250
Does that mean that there was
no point in our being born?

411
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,625
Would you say that of
our slain comrades?

412
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,708
What about their lives?

413
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,583
Were they meaningless?

414
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,625
They were not!

415
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:48,125
Their memory serves as
an example to us all!

416
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,750
The courageous fallen!

417
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,333
The anguished fallen!

418
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,708
Their lives have meaning
because we, the living,

419
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,500
refuse to forget them!

420
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,666
And as we ride to certain death,

421
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,166
we trust our successors
to do the same for us.

422
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,625
Because my soldiers
do not buckle or yield
