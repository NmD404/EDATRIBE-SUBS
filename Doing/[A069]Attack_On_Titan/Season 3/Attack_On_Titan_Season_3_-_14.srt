quite the welcome.

He's watching their
movements for now.

[ERWIN] That quadruped type has
some kind of cargo on its back,

which tells me that it
didn't transform just now.

17
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,750
[ERWIN] It's also likely that
this was the enemy's scout.

18
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,458
But for it to take
notice of our approach

19
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,250
and relay that
information to Reiner...

20
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,500
That must mean...

21
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,750
They have one more

00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,083

31
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,291
[ERWIN] This is just like
the siege of Utgard Castle.

32
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,125
They'll start by
targeting the horses.

33
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,625
Their primary objective
is still to capture Eren.

34
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,125
But towards that end,

35
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,125
they intend to eliminate
our only chance of escape.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,250
[ERWIN]
As of five years ago,

37
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,541
Wall Maria's perimeter is
deep in Titan territory.

38
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,208
So, if they do
wipe out our horses,

39
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,375
we'll have no means
of getting back.

40
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,666
Not only would this
block our escape route,

41
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,750
it would cut off
our supply lines.

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,083
[ERWIN]
It might take a week or a month,

43
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,458
but there will come a point
at which none of us can move.

44
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,291
They'll forgo the risks
of a proper battle,

45
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,041
and opt instead to take Eren
once he's too weak to resist.

00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,416
[ERWIN]
I'm sure of it now.

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,625
The proof is in the fact
that those larger Titans

48
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,916
are still standing in formation.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,750

to prevent our retreat.

Yes. I'm well aware.

[ERWIN] At this point,
the thing I fear most

56
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,708
is that Reiner and Bertholdt
will reach our horses

57
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,041

I'm going to need you
right here, Levi.

So I'll protect the
horses instead of Eren?

That's right.

And when the chance arises,
you'll strike him down.

I wasn't fast enough to finish
off the Armored one earlier,

taking the Beast Titan's head.

I'll kill the horses
and make a break for it.

No matter how strong
Captain Levi is,

100
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,333

for our War Chief.

to check inside the walls?

[REINER]
What is he thinking?

123
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,500
[REINER] Will he run south
and climb over the wall?

124
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,166
As a Titan, he could circle
around and escape to Trost

125
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,500
without a horse.

126
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,125
[REINER]
Were that to happen,

127
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,291
we'd have no reason
to stay here and fight.

128
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,750
Even if we did manage to
annihilate the Scouts,

129
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,583
Eren mastered hardening
in two months.

130
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,833
We can't let him
back in the walls.

00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,375
No way.

132
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,875
If he learns how to harness
the Coordinate's full power,

133
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,208
we're finished.

134
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,291

Hold on.

00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,000
Something's off here.

136
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,708
If his goal really
was to escape,

137
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,166
he would've used ODM gear
to scale the south wall

138
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,916
and then transformed.

139
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,458
[REINER]
But instead he transformed

140
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,458
right in front of me,
in the center of town.

141
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,750
[REINER]
I get it.

142
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,083
He's a diversion.

143
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,833
They're trying to change my
target from the horses to Eren!

144
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,958
You're not giving me any
time to think, Commander.

145
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,958
You clever bastard.

146
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,583
Makin' me get down
when I just climbed up.

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,583
[EREN]
Good. He went for it!

148
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,208
[HANGE]
He wants to use Eren as bait?

149
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,958
Yes, that was the
Commander's order.

150
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,083
[HANGE]
Hold on.

151
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,291
So he's willing to
risk Eren's capture

152
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,916
just to protect the horses?

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500
You're kidding.

154
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,708
Even if we try it, Reiner might
just go after the horses anyway.

155
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:46,625
[HANGE]
No.

156
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sure he'll chase Eren.

157
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,333
If Reiner does go
after the horses,

158
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,125
then Eren can
continue running north

159
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,875
and wrap around the
Beast Titan's formation.

160
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,208
With Levi, the Scouts, and Eren,

161
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,875
they can catch the Beast
Titan in a pincer attack.

162
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,625
Erwin must've said as
much himself, right?

163
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,041
[ARMIN]
Um, yes.

164
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,125
Even if things
don't go as we hope,

165
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,333
the enemy doesn't
expect Eren to flee,

166
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,291
so it might confuse them enough
to get them to break ranks.

167
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,541
The only question is can
Reiner see that far ahead.

168
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,208
Knowing him, he should
work it out pretty quickly.

169
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,500
Okay.

170
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,625
This is where we'll bring
down the Armored Titan.

171
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,541
[ARMIN gasps]
Wait a second!

172
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,833
There's one more factor
we need to consider.

173
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:37,625
He's still hiding,
but Bertholdt must be nearby.

174
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,208
The last time they fought,

175
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,625
Eren outmaneuvered Reiner and
had him on the verge of defeat,

176
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,458
but then Bertholdt caught
him with a surprise attack,

177
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,458

It might've been a fluke,

223
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,750
[ERWIN] We struggle against

224
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,791
The Scouts have grown weak.

225
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,000
Most of our veterans have
been buried, burned, or...

226
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,083
[ERWIN] Still, if not for
the lives we sacrificed,

227
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,458
we never would have
made it half this far.

228
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,375
[ERWIN]
When I was a cadet,

229
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,041
I told the others about
my father's theory--

230
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,750
My faith in it.

231
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,500
I told them that
once I was a scout,

232
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,333
I would prove he was right.

233
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,916
[ERWIN] But once I actually
joined the Scouts,

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,125
I stopped talking
about it for some reason.

235
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,583
No, that's wrong.

236
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,541
[ERWIN]
It wasn't "some reason."

237
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,750
I'd realized something.

238
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,166
That of all my brave comrades,

239
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,083
only one was
fighting for himself.

240
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,416
They bled and died
for each other,

241
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,875
while I fought for
a selfish dream.

242
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,500
[ERWIN]
Then I came to lead my comrades.

243
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,125
Gave them orders
and inspiring words.

244
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,375
Be brave.

245
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,375
Give your hearts to humanity.

246
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,083
I played them all for fools.

00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,541
Myself, too.

Still,

Grisha's secret lingers
in the back of my mind.

00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,333
Even if this plan should fail,

254
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,291
there's a chance that I could
still reach that cellar.

I'd like to see it.

really came through

And I told 'em that
while they were at it,

292
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,000
they should try to
cook up a weapon

293
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,916
that'll work against
the Armored Titan.

294
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,458
And that's what
they came up with?

295
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,583
Our blades may as well
have been made of paper

296
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,083

All we could do
in our last battle

00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,458
was watch Eren fight

from the sidelines.

00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,958
There just aren't enough

00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,500

Even at close range,

304
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,291
we couldn't do anything

00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,041
[CONNY] Back then,
if the Commander hadn't

306
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,458
drawn that horde of

307
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,833
[HANGE] Until now, the only
attacks that've hurt Reiner

308
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,416
did so by working
around his armor.

309
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,083
I'm referring to Eren's
grappling techniques.

310
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,833
Also, Eren's been experimenting
with a new "hardened punch,"

311
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,166
for which we have high hopes.

312
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,750
With that said, if those
were our sole weapons,

313
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,625
this mission would
be doomed to fail.

314
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,333
It's vital that we plug
the holes in Wall Maria,

315
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,000
but what matters most here

316
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,291
is that we eliminate
Bertholdt and Reiner,

317
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,208
ensuring that they can't
breach the wall again.

318
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,583
Okay, so what's the plan?

319
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,041
We'll stab the Armored Titan
with those spears?

Hence our calling them

They're good weapons,

328
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,416
but are they enough to
bring down the Armored Titan?

329
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,375
There's no way to be
sure until we try.

330
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,625
These can tear
a normal Titan apart,

331

but to do real damage
against the Armored Titan,

332
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,791
it'll take some extra work.
