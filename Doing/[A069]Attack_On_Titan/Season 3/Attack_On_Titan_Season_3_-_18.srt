1
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,625
I should've realized.

2
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,875
Of course this would happen.

3
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:48,500
Still... trusting your plan
was the only choice I had.

4
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,541
But why?

5
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,833
Armin...

6
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,541
Why don't you ever run?

7
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,833
[clattering]

8
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,208
[gasps]

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,125
[EREN]
A Titan?

10
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:08,750
[EREN gasps]

11
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:11,958
Damn it!

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,125
[EREN]
Just try and come closer!

13
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,583
Make one move to take him
and I'll slit his throat!

14
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,125
[EREN]
Hold on.

15
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,833
Those markings around his eyes.

16
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,750
Are they what I think?

17
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,541
This must be the Beast Titan.

18
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,041
I found you.

19
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,416
Eren Jaeger, right?

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,666
[growls]

21
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,458
[EREN] If nothing else,
I'll take him with me!

22
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,916
You don't look a thing
like your father.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,291
[EREN gasps]

24
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,625
What?

25
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,708
Believe me, Eren.

26
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,916
I get it. I know how you feel.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,708
The both of us are just
victims of your father.

28
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:01,416
I'm sorry, but he's
brainwashed you.

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,041
[gasps]

30
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,666
[EREN]
What're you talking about?

31
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,666
[ZEKE groans]
You're kidding.

32
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,500
He chased me all this way?

33
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,666
What a monster.

34
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,333
[groans] Let's call
it a draw, Levi.

35
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,416
We're in no shape to fight now.

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,666
Bertholdt.

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm sorry, but this
is the end for you.

38
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,500
[ZEKE]
Eren.

39
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,791
Someday, I'll come back
and save you from this.

40
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,666
Huh?

41
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,416
[EREN]
He ran?

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,833
[LEVI grunts]

43
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,708
Captain!

44
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,625
I just used the last of my gas.

45
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,208
Quick, give me your gear
so I can chase him.

46
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,083
Right!

47
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,375
[LEVI]
Hurry!

48
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,750
[ARMIN coughs]

49
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,166
[EREN gasps]

50
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,250
[HANGE]
Reiner.

51
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,750
What's this metal case we found
in your left breast pocket?

52
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,500
Before we closed in and
chopped off your limbs,

53
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,541
you used what strength
you had left to grab at it.

54
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,125
So what's inside?

55
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,333
Suicide pills? A bomb?

56
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,166
Ow!

57
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,666
Sorry, Jean.

58
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,125
It's a letter.

59
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,083
A letter?

60
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,291
What does it say?

61
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,750
It's for Christa.

62
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,458
Ymir wrote it.

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,125
[REINER]
Whatever you do with me,

64
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,125
just make sure she
gets to read it.

65
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,541
Only after we've inspected it.

66
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,041
[HANGE]
Now then.

67
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,083
I've got lots of questions
that you could answer, but...

68
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,708
[JEAN gasps]

69
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,083
...you're a tough one.

70
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,958
If you don't wanna talk,
I can't make you.

71
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,583
So I'll ask.

72
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,750
Will you cooperate and tell us
everything that we want to know?

73
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,125
I won't.

74
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,416
Thank you, Reiner.

75
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,458
It helps to see that
you're ready for death.

76
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,583
[JEAN gasps]

77
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,083
[HANGE grunts]

78
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,750
Hange, wait!

79
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,791
We--need him alive.

80
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:23,791
So we can steal his power.

81
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,208
[HANGE gasps]

82
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,041
[ERWIN]
Pay close attention.

83
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,416
I'm about to explain how
we can get maximum value

84
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,916
from this syringe.

85
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,666
[ERWIN]
Using its contents,

86
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,416
we can steal any Titan's powers.

87
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
That goes for the Colossal,
Armored, and Beast Titans.

88
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,000
As for how,

89
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,625
we first need to defeat one
of these Intelligent Titans.

90
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,375
Then, we'll inject
one of our comrades,

91
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,291
turning them into a pure Titan.

92
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,250
They'll be in that mindless
state only for a brief time.

93
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,916
Once they consume
the captured foe,

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,208
they'll revert into a human,

95
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,291
but gain the power to
shift forms at will.

96
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,250
If this is achieved,

97
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:09,041
then not only will we gain
knowledge and a powerful weapon,

98
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,375
we'll also be able to bring
one of our soldiers back

99
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,791
from the brink of death.

100
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,333
Should you capture
an enemy shifter,

101
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,291
be sure to sever their limbs.

102
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:23,166
Once it's safe to do so,
try to locate Captain Levi.

103
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,208
[ERWIN]
We have only this one injection.

104
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,916
The captain will decide
when to use it, and on whom.

105
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,833
We don't know the situation
with Levi on the other side.

106
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,041
And we don't have the time to
go and confirm it ourselves.

107
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,625
These Titan powers have
exceeded our understanding

108
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,041
too many times.

109
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,125
We thought we had him before.

110
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:51,416
I refuse to underestimate
his power again.

111
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,250
I'll start by beheading him,

112
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,166
but that's not
enough on its own.

113
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,250
[JEAN]
This isn't like you, Hange.

114
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,208
[JEAN] If we back down from the
chance to cure our ignorance,

115
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,291
then what hope do we have

116
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,750
of beating the Titans
down the road?

117
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,875
Jean.

118
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,250
We need to find out all that
we can about the enemy,

119
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,916
or we'll lose.

120
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:23,958
Mikasa.

121
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:24,916
Yeah?

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,166
How much gas do you have left?

123
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,708
Not enough to fight anything.

124
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:34,083
I think I could reach Eren
and Armin, but then I'd be out.

125
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,375
Well that's more than I have.

126
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,833
[HANGE]
Find them, Mikasa.

127
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,333
Go and evaluate the situation.

128
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,041
[HANGE] Refill your gas,
retrieve the syringe from Levi,

129
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,750
and bring it back to me.

130
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,166
If you're unable to do so,

131
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,416
then regardless of the reason,
fire off a smoke signal.

132
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,833
That will be my cue
to end Reiner.

133
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,416
Understood.

134
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,791
Thank you, Hange. I--

135
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,916
[HANGE]
The decision was mine.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,958
You were just a factor.

137
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,750
[JEAN]
Why did I speak up for him?

138
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,375
When it comes down
to it, am I still--?

139
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,291
[EREN]
Yeah! Hell yeah!

--Armin's still breathing.

141

142
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,541
Keep going!

Don't give up!

144
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,958
You can make it!

145
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,541
That's Armin?

146
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,625
Captain! Get the syringe!

147
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,416
[EREN grunts]
Turn Armin into a Titan,

148
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,833
and then we can have
him eat Bertholdt!

149
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,333
Hurry up and inject him!

150
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,000

Right.

Don't chase them!

[gasps] Huh?

168
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,875
Chances are,
you'd just get killed,

169
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,291
even if you had gas left.

170
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,125

Son of a bitch!

171
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,750
This is all my fault.

172
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,541
He'd be dead.

173
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,833
He needed to die.
Why'd I open my mouth?

174
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,916
[HANGE] I told you,
the decision was mine.

I finally found you.

It's the commander.

His stomach is gouged, and his
insides are all torn to shreds.

184
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,416
The blood just won't stop!

185
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,250
I thought that injection might
be able to help him, but...

186
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,833
...what do you think?

187
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,416
[EREN]
Huh...?

188
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,750
Captain Levi.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,958
It's faint, but he's breathing.

190
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,291
Erwin.

191
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,958
You're alive.

192
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,625
You know what has to happen.

193
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,833
Erwin gets the shot.

195
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,083
You can't.

196
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,750
You told me you'd
use it on Armin.

197
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,916
[LEVI] I'm going to revive the
person who can save humanity.

[FLOCH gasps]

199
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,916
[ZEKE]
Reiner.

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,125
You were incredibly lucky today.

201
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,875
You two.

202
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,125
Do you have even the
faintest damn clue...

203

...what you're doing?

204
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,500
[LEVI]
It's Erwin...

...the Commander
of the Scouts...

206
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,000
...and you're telling
me to watch him die?

207
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,166
[LEVI]
There's no time for this.

208
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,875
Just get out of my way.

210
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,583
Eren. Check your emotions.

211
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,708
Sorry, Captain. Can't do that.

212
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,125
Tell me.

213
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,166
Why didn't you give Armin
the injection right away?

214
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,208
I was thinking about Erwin.

215
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,166
Considering the chance
that he might be alive.

216
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,375
But you couldn't have known

217
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,041
that Floch would carry
the commander here.

218
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,708
There's no way you
would've seen that coming!

219
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,625
You aren't wrong, Eren.

220
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,833
But the fact remains,
he's here now.

221
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,416
So I'll revive him.

Hey!

He's too exhausted to stop me.

228
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,875
I could take it
from him by force.

You know just as well as I do.

Think about it.

Think about what he's done.

241
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:30,375
We used his plan to take back
Trost with that boulder.

242
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,291
He's the one who
realized what Annie was.

243
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:37,541
It was his idea to avoid the
Titans by coming here at night!

244
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,291
He's the only reason we
uncovered Reiner's hiding spot,

245
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,416
and the only reason
we defeated Bertholdt!

246

We only got this far
because of Armin!

who've suffered
through all this?

Not that you asked, but...

00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,625
...on the other
side of that wall,

260
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,500
there's not a single
soldier left alive.

261
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,041
The Beast Titan threw
crushed boulders at everyone.

262
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,916
That field is soaked with
the blood of my comrades.

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,333
Commander Erwin was the
only survivor I could find.

264
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,208
He came up with a plan.

Found a way for us to strike
back at the Beast Titan,

266
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,250
and so we did.

267
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,750
My comrades were smashed to
bits just as he'd planned.

268
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:50,041
I'm sure the last thing
they felt was fear.

269
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,333
All-consuming fear...

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,833
[FLOCH] When I realized the
commander was still alive,

271
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,541
I almost finished
him off myself.

272
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,875
[FLOCH]
But then...

273
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,541
...I recognized that
would be a mercy.

274
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,208
[FLOCH]
And I thought to myself

275
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,916
that he ought to taste
more of this hell.

276
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,458
[FLOCH]
Suddenly, I understood.

277
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,125
[FLOCH] If we wanna stand any
chance against the Titans,

00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,041
we need a devil!

00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,416
I realized that's what Erwin is,

280
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,541
and that it's my mission
to bring him back!

281
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,458
That's why a coward like me
outlived the heroes around him.

282
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,791
Because Erwin needs to fight on!

283
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,583

You're right. He has
an amazing mind.

It's tough for me, too.

It's hard to stay sane

Do you... know about... the sea?

It's like a lake, but enormous.

So big that it stretches
past the horizon.

And its full of salty water.

[FLOCH]
Hey! Stop making this harder!

a sea beyond the walls.

He said that we'd
go there together!

Thing is, that's been our

...wanted to reach that cellar.

They're all the same.

about this dream or that.

There's more out there, though.

Did you just--?

Excuse me...

365
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,791
...but how can we be sure that
there aren't other humans...

Every last one of us.

00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:57,083
I'll reach the Beast
Titan and tear him apart.

00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,000
Thank you.

373
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,708

Captain... why?

Do you think... you can
forgive him someday?

385
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,958
He became a devil
'cause he had to.

386
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,125
We were the ones
who put him up to it.

we were about to bring
him back for more.

it's time we let him rest.

I told you I would
kill the Beast Titan,

393
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,791
but that'll have to wait.

394
