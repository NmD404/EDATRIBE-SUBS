Damn. You prick.

179
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,666
You knew what I was
after this whole time.

180
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,041
And you knew I didn't have
a chance in hell of gettin' it.

181
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,166
But'cha went ahead
and used me, huh?

182
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,333
I'm very grateful. When my
brother first brought you

183
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,500
into his service,
I thought it was just one of

184
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,166
his foolish whims, but y--

185
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,291
You keep on
talkin' shit about Uri,

186
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,375
and you can kiss this half
of your head goodbye!

187
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,791
[CHRISTA] Stop it!
Get away from my father!

188
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,375
[ROD groans]

189
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:01,375
Come on. This is pitiful.
Don't you get it yet, Historia?

190
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,750
Your daddy doesn't give a damn!

191
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,083
He brought you here so he can
turn you into a monster.

192
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,000
And after that he's gonna
make you eat your buddy Eren.

193
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,458
If that's my duty
then that's what I'll do.

194
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,291
[KENNY]
Yeah?

195
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,500
[CHRISTA]
Yeah. I've decided.

196
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,208
I'll eat Eren and
bring my sister back!

197
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,958
I'll inherit
the world's history,

198
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,041
and exterminate
every last Titan!

199
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,791
If that's my duty,
then... I'll do it!

200
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,291
Damn it, Historia,
think about this.

201
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,916
What the hell has this
old bastard ever done for you?

202

--[metal scrapes]
--[gasps]

203
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,708
Only reason he picked you up

204
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,625
is 'cause of that
royal blood of yours.

205
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,583
This piece of trash
is too scared to turn

206
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,041
into a Titan himself.
That's why he forced

207
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,541
his brother and daughter
to do it for him!

208
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,416
That's the kind of man
your daddy is.

209
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,541
[KENNY]
Ah.

210
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,583
He's wrong, Historia.
That isn't the truth.

211
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:05,250
It's essential that I do not
become a Titan myself.

212
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,083
You mustn't believe him.

213
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,291
I'm the only man alive
you can trust.

214
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,458
[KENNY]
Hmm. Is that so?

215

--[CHRISTA] Father!
--[ROD coughing]

216
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,875
Kenny. You served me well
up to this moment.

217
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,125
You're free now.

218
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,083
Go find another
purpose for your life,

219
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,000
and live out your years.

220
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,500
That'd bore me to death. So...

221
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,083
Kenny. Just what
are you planning to do?

222
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,541
If she wants to
turn into a Titan,

223
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,166
well, then that's
her choice to make.

224
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,166
But I say the boy
should get a fair shot.

225
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,041
[EREN gasps]

226
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,583
[KENNY] They can both turn
Titan and fight it out.

227
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,875
If Historia wins, well,
then you'll have your peace.

228
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,125
But if Eren takes her down,
the situation stays the same.

229
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,875
--[EREN gasps]
--[CHRISTA gasps]

230
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,250
[KENNY] Go on livin' for
the sake of drawin' breath?

231
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,375
That doesn't sound like
any kind of life to me.

232
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,583
Historia! Take this injection
and you'll become

233
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,375
a powerful Titan!

234
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,708
If you can remember,
it's not enough

235
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,333
just to bite him anywhere.

236
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:36,291
To take his powers, you have to
consume his spinal fluid!

237
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,833
[CHRISTA gasps]

238
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,208
[KENNY]
Reckon I'd better step back.

239
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,583
Go on, you have to hurry!

240
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,291
[gasps]

241
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,958
[CHRISTA]
Eren, why?

242
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,958
Why aren't you transforming?

243
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,291
You're gonna fight back,
aren't you?

244
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,208
You can't just let me.

245
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,291
[CHRISTA]
Defend yourself!

246
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,416
Historia! This is your chance!

247
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
It didn't have to be like this.

248
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,166
Huh?

249
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,166
All that death
could've been avoided.

250
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,333
Five years ago, if Dad
hadn't done what he did...

251
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,125
Your sister.

252
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:30,541
She would've been able to
do something to stop all this.

253
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,458
But because my dad chose
to steal your family's power

254
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,291
from its rightful owner,

255
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,833
countless people
ended up getting killed.

256
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:44,958
[EREN] Armin's grandpa.
Thomas, Nack, Mina, Milieus.

257
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,750
Marco. Everyone on Levi Squad.

258
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,416
The people of Stohess.

259
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,041
The soldiers
who came to save me.

260
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,791
And Hannes.

261
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,666
I can never atone
for all of their pain.

262
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,416
That never should've happened.

263
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,416
Those days I spent in training.

264
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,000
That stupid dream that
I could see the world.

265
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,541
And me. I shouldn't
have happened.

266
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,208
[EREN]
If nothing else,

267
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:33,208
then at least let it
end at your hand.

268
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:38,458
Take your power back,
then use it to save humanity.

269
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:46,166
[EREN]
It's all up to you.

270
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:57,166
Eren. I remember.

271
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,291
When you said I was a
normal girl, I was so happy.

272
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:12,375
I see. This your idea
of trying to be nice?

273
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:22,333
What's wrong, Historia?
Are you scared?

274
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:27,291
All you have to do is inject
the liquid into your body.

275
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:31,541
[CHRISTA]
Wait. Father.

276
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,666
For a hundred years
we had the power,

277
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,541
but we didn't use it.

278
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,375
Why didn't our family
do something?

279
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,458
If we could control the Titans,

280
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,333
then why didn't we
liberate humanity?

281
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,666
That's because the same king
who built this world

282
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,916
within the walls for humanity,

283
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,416
wanted us to live in fear
of the Titans for all of time.

284
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,041
The First King believed this
to be the only path

285
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:05,875
to lasting peace.
But I can't tell you why.

286
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:10,041
Because only those who've seen
the world's memories can know!

287
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,125
Many years ago, my brother
and I pleaded with our father

288
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,875
to free humanity
from the Titans.

289
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,041
We asked him
time and time again.

290
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,166
However, he would not
fulfill our wish.

291
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:30,666
[ROD] Eventually, the time came
for one of us to succeed him.

292
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,291
After my brother
completed the ritual,

293
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:38,375
when I looked into
his eyes, I understood.

294
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:43,208
My brother wasn't there.
He had become something greater.

295
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,458
An omniscient being,
exempt from death,

296
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,833
who built and rules over
the world we live in.

297
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:53,083
Do you know what
such a being is called?

298
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,708
God.

299
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,541
There is no other word
aside from God.

300
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,625
So now it's my sacred duty
to bring God back to this world,

301
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,291
and then to offer up my prayers.

302
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,375
I'm praying right now, Historia,

303
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:13,750
for God to return and
lead mankind once again!

304
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,750
[YMIR]
Christa.

305
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,583
I have no business telling you
how to live your life.

306
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,125
It's not my place.

307
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,291
So I guess
when you break it down,

308
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,875
this is really just
more of a hope.

309
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,083
