Nice "palace."

[CHRISTA]
Don't you run from me!

00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,625
[ARMIN]
Yeah, she's not exactly regal.

8
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:08,041
Well, it's only been two
months since she was crowned.

9
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,125
But it seems like she'd
rather run an orphanage

10
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,625
than a kingdom.

11
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,208
Have you heard the new name
the people came up with for her?

12
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,041
They call her the
Cattle-Farming Goddess.

13
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,875
I think it's a term
of endearment.

14
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:24,375
It's hardly the first time
she's been called goddess.

15
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,625
You know, if this keeps up,

16
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,625
I bet everyone'll forget
all about the chump

17
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,875
who plugged up
the wall in Trost.

18
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,666
This is part of why Historia
agreed to become Queen

19
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,250
in the first place.

20
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,750
So she could do all this.

21
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,166
Do what?

22
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,583
[EREN]
She went from the underground

23
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,041
to the edge of the walls

24
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,916
and saved all the orphans
and needy she could find.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,666
She even got the
captain into it,

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,166
since he grew up underground.

27
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,000

28
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,958
and saying that
no one needs them,

29
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,041
she has to prove them wrong.

30
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:58,083
She told me that she
needs them to be okay.

31
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,125

What would you do?

00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,541
If you found Reiner

43
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,041
and had to face them again?

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,166
I guess I'd have to
kill them. No choice.

considering how you said

As part of the coup de tat,

00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,166
the military had to purge
people of considerable talent

But discoveries such
as the glowing ore

68
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:50,750
in the underground cavern
counteracted these losses.

00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,250
Also, thanks to Eren's
hardening ability,

70
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:58,666

convince you to stay an MP?

Wait, Hitch? How come?

104
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,041
Because she's a thirsty girl,

105
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,291
and she thinks you're
a tall glass of water.

106

Can't say I follow,

107
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,708
but Hitch did tell
me off before,

108
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,708
saying I wasn't cut out
to be a real soldier.

109
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,708
She told me I should
"stop acting cool"

110
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,875
and just coast along in life.

111
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,291
I had thought she
was better than that.

112
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,875
So I told her I was
wrong about her.

113
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:48,875

Well, anyway,

back to normal someday?

I mean, it's not
impossible, is it?

142
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:11,291
Well, if our knowledge about
Titans continues to improve,

143
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,458
then yeah, maybe.

144
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,125
[EREN] You're telling us
that Titans are people?

145
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,708

but it's possible.

00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,875
Every day was like waking
up into a nightmare.

00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,541
Like a nightmare.

150
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,083
[ARMIN]
Hm?

151
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,458
So much has happened that I
haven't had time to question it.

152
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:38,125
But who do you guys think that
it is we're fighting against?

153
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:42,041
The thing is, I've always
hated the Titans.

154
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,500
But what if they're just people

155
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,250
being tormented
by some nightmare?

156
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,708
For a time at least,
I was one of them myself.

[MIKASA] You still have
bread and soup left.

mumbling, already.

From the memories
you were given,

when Reiss and
Historia touched you.

170

You said you saw a Scout that
must've known your dad, right?

Yeah.

172
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,833
I think he might've been with
my dad when the wall fell.

173
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,791
If he's alive,
he'll know something.

174
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,625
He seemed so familiar.

175
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,083
I can't shake the feeling
that I've met him somewhere.

176
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,458
Do you mean he seemed
familiar to you?

177
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,875
Or just your dad?

178
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,416
Me, I think.

179
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,458
It might help to smack
yourself in the head.

180
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,083
Yeah, you should try that out.

181
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,791
You know what else
might be helpful?

182
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,625
If instead of holdin'
hands with Historia,

183
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,875
ya got a head-butt
from the Commandant.

184
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,625
If that'd help me
remember, I'd--

185
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,083
Hey, wait.

186
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,583
[ALL gasp]

187
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,750
That's who I saw with my dad.

188
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,041
It's Commandant Sadies.

189
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,583
[HANGE]
Sadies was the 12th Commander

190
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,000
of the Scout Regiment.

191
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,625
And Commander
Erwin's predecessor.

192
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,791
It's been a long while
since I've seen him.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,708
[EREN]
Commandant Sadies.

194
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,125
What's the matter,
Braus? Not gonna sit?

195
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,250
No! I'm quite fine
standing here, sir!

196
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's see.

197
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,583
If I recall, back in the day,
I'd call you in here a lot,

198
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,416
when I was about
to chew you out.

199
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,458
It's only been a
handful of months.

200
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,333
And yet, I barely
recognize you kids.

201
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:19,583
So Commander Sadies--
Or wait, Commandant now.

202
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,250
We should be prepping
to recapture Wall Maria.

203
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,916
But tell me:

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,500
Why do you suppose we came
to speak with you instead?

205
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,333
Eren.

206
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,958
You look like your mother
in almost every way.

207
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:44,041
However, the daggers I
see within your eyes...

208
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,458
...those are your father's.

209
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,916
Tell me about him!

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,166
Tell me everything you know!

211
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,875
don't know much at all.

212
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,250
Not in the grand
scheme of things.

213
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,583
That said, I'll tell you a story

214
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:00,083
that's of no value
whatsoever to humanity.

215
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:04,833
The story of my past,
as nothing but a bystander.

216
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,500
[KEITH] Twenty years ago,
near Wall Maria,

217
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:13,291
I found him standing outside
of the gate to Shiganshina.

218
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,291
Hey, what are you doing?

219
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,333
How the hell did you get here?

220
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,000
Did you climb down
the wall somehow?

221
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,875
Wait, why would any of you
venture outside the walls?

222
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,375
Don't tell me you're trying
to fight those things.

223
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,958
[KEITH]
Huh?

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,916
[KEITH]
Was it the truth or a lie?

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,375
He said he couldn't remember
why he was outside the walls.

226
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,000
All of his memories
had been lost.

227
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,541
Everything aside from his name.

228
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,958
Grisha Jaeger.

229
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,250
[HANNES]
Who knew it was a crime

230
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,875
to go into Titan territory
without permission?

231
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,791
I bet he's the first
guy who's tried it.

232
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,916
I mean, I always thought
that only you Scouts

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,958
were dumb enough
to go out there.

234
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,625
[KEITH] Something tells
me there's also a law

235
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,000
that jails idiots
who drink on duty.

236
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,416
Eh, Hannes?

237
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,125
Ugh. Anyway, it's not like
he actually hurt anybody.

238
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,458
So let's just keep it
to ourselves, yeah?

239
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,916
Yeah.

240
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,875
[KEITH]
So, Grisha.

241
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,291
Do you have any idea
where you'll go from here?

242
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,375
Maybe I can help.

243
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,250
There is one thing I remember
aside from my name.

244
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,291
I was a doctor.

245
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,291
Introduce me to a hospital.

246
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,625
I should be able to help there.

247
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,041
Huh.

248
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,958
[GRISHA] Also, do you
think you could teach me?

249
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,708
About this world, I mean.

250
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,083
And about the Scouts, too.

251
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,958
About everything
inside the walls.

252
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,208
[KEITH] He truly appeared
to know nothing at all.

253
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:54,250
Not about this world.
Not about anything.

254
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,875
I see.

255
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,750
Although there's inequality,

256
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,625
life in the walls is
largely peaceful.

257
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,125
And if nothing else,

258
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,875
you aren't living in
constant fear of the Titans.

259
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,333
That's good.

260
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,625
[KEITH]
You think so, do ya?

261
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,958
That means you're
just like the rest.

262
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,208
[GRISHA]
Huh?

263
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,458
We're trapped
inside these walls.

264
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,208
But as long as there's plenty of
food and alcohol to go around,

265
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,583
most people are
just fine with that.

266
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,291
In their whole lives,
they'll never question

267
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,500
how wide the world might be.

268
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,750
Is that why you risk your life
to venture outside the walls?

269
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,208
To see how wide the world is?

270
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:37,208
That's right.
Does it seem foolish?

271
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,958
No, quite the opposite.

272
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,541
The Scouts are wiser and
braver than anyone else

273
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,166
living within the walls.

274
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,125
Their very existence
is living proof

275
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,083
that the imagination and soul
of mankind are still free.

276
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,416
That's what you
think? Seriously?

277
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,708
Yes.

278
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,041
[CARLA]
What's this, Keith?

279
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,833
Huh?

280
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,291
You better not be recruiting
for the Scouts again.

281
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,916
No. Not this time,
Carla. I was just--

282
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,208
[GRISHA]
Oh, no.

283
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,208
I'm not really suited
for that kind of work.

284
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,708
It takes someone special
to become a Scout.

285
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,333
You have to be a chosen one.

286
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,375
That's one way to put it.

287
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,708
[KEITH]
I was a chosen one.

288
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:24,041
That was the first time
anyone had told me that.

289
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:28,166
But I knew that those walls
were far too cramped for me.

290
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,916
[KEITH yells]

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,333
So this expedition
failed as well.

292
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,791
[OFFICER 48B]
When will you finish the base

293
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,541
outside the wall?

294
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,416
[KEITH]
If only I was commander...

295
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,041
I could show results.

296
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,166
As idiotic as these people are,

297
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,458
I'd accomplish so much that
even they'd understand.

298
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,500
And then everyone would
have to acknowledge me.

299
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,833
[KEITH]
Grisha!

300
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,041
Carla caught the plague
that's going around.

301
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,583
They say there's no cure, but--

302
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,416
[GRISHA]
Put her in the rear bed.

303
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,625
Please, Dr. Jaeger.

304
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:11,291
My mom and dad,
they've gotten sick, too.

305
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,291
Not to worry.
I'll help everyone.

306
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,750
[HANNES]
Doctor! It's a miracle!

307
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,958
My wife is well again!

308
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,208
[CARLA]
Dr. Jaeger. Thank you so much!

309
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,833
[CITIZEN 48A]
Way to go! You'll do great!

310
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,250
[OFFICER 48A] You're hereby
appointed Commander

311
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,458
of the Scout Regiment.

Congratulations, Dr. Jaeger!

Shit! Our base!

[TITAN 48A roars]

317
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,416
It's no use! We need
to retreat! Commander!

318
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,083
[CITIZEN 48C]
The moron keeps leading his men

319
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,291
straight into death.

320
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,583
Yet he's the only one
who always lives.

321
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,125
[CITIZEN 48B]
That's not quite true.

322
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,583
I hear no one on Erwin's
squad has died yet.

323
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,000
[CITIZEN 48D] Then maybe
he should be Commander.

324
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,541
[KEITH]
Someone special.

325
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,208
A chosen one.

326
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,291
[CARLA]
Keith?

327
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,500
[gasps]

328
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,583
Carla. Who's the kid?

329
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,750
[CARLA]
Eren. Our baby boy.

330
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,666
I guess the news never
made it your way.

331
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,000
My husband worries about you.

332
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,916
Yeah. I'm sorry.

333
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,583
Are you planning to keep this up
until you get yourself killed?

334
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,916
[gasps]

335
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,958
I think it's time.

336
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,083
Do you wanna know why
most people live and die

337
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,458
without accomplishing
a single damn thing?

338
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,125
It's because they've lost
their imaginations!

339
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,416
They'll complacently
waste their entire lives,

340
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,166
unashamed of the fact
that all they'll ever add

341
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,875
to the world is shit!

342
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,208
Such people are little
more than cattle!

343
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,625
They can't even
comprehend greatness!

344
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,958
Not even when it's right
in front of them!

345
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,375
So a girl who flirts
with every man in sight,

346
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,958
one who's good for
absolutely nothing

347
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,875
aside from keeping
people's drinks full...

348
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,625
...could never--

349
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,875
[KEITH]
It's true.

350
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,083
Normal people can't
accomplish a thing.

351
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,125
Hey, Erwin. I want you
to take my command.

352
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,791
[KEITH]
Special people do exist.

353
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:58,958
All this means... is that
I was never one of them.

354
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,708
It's such an obvious fact,

355
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,125
so why couldn't I see it?

356
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,375
[CITIZEN 48E]
Wall Maria has fallen!

357
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,916
Shiganshina District
was demolished!

358
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,458
They're gonna come
for Trost next!

359
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:18,500
[PEOPLE screaming]

360
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,583
[GRISHA]
Keith!

361
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,458
[KEITH gasps]

362
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,291
[KEITH]
Oh, yeah. That's why.

363
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,708
It's 'cause of what you said.

364
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,583
[GRISHA]
Eren.

365
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,083
Wake up, Eren.

366
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,333
Why wasn't your mother with you?

367
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,208
I'm sorry.

368
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,791
Mom was trapped,
and a Titan came.

369
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,250
[EREN]
It ate her.

370
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,708
[GRISHA]
Eren.

371
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,708
You'll avenge her. You must.

372
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,916
I know that you can.

373
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,166
Let's go.

374
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,083
Hold on. Where are you going?

375
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,750
[GRISHA]
Please don't follow us.

376
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,666
Grisha, why not avenge
Carla yourself?

377
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,500
I know you could do it.

378
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,458
All this time, you were
the one who was special.

379
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,000
I know that I never was.

380
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,708
But what if that boy
is the same as me?

381
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,208
What if he isn't a
chosen one either?

382
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:44,000
Is... Eren next?
Will you curse him too now?

383
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,791
This child isn't
like you, Keith.

384
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,541
Eren is my son.

385
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,666
Please don't get involved.
This is a family affair.

386
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,833
[KEITH]
That light.

387
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,500
[KEITH]
After I found you,

388
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:19,000
I carried your unconscious body
back to the shelter... and left.

389
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:25,208
[KEITH]
And that is everything I know.

390
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,833
So that's it. I see.

391
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:42,208
At least now I know the real
reason you chose to resign.

392
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,125
Not to atone for all the
soldiers you got killed,

393
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,291
but because you realized that
you're not a special snowflake.

394
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,291
Just a delusional,
self-centered child.

395
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,666
Lay off him, Hange.

396
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,375
You had no right to keep
all of this to yourself,

397
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,166
just to spare your own ego.

398
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,541
We pledged to give our
lives and our hearts

399
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,000
for the good of mankind!

400
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,291
Please, let it go, Commander.

401
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,416
The Commandant was right.

402
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,750
Just like him,
I was never special.

403
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:14,458
Looks like... I was just
the son of a man who was.

404
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,791
That's all there is to it.

405
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:24,291
After I yelled at her, this is
what your mother said back.

406
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,666
Why should anyone
have to be special?

407
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,000
[gasps]

408
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:34,208
That just isn't the way
I like to look at things.

409
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,958
And when it comes to my child,

410
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:40,375
I don't care if he
grows up to be great.

411
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,458
My son doesn't have to
be better than anyone.

412
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,458
[CARLA]
After all, just look at him.

413
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,791
He's so cute.

414
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,375
I think Eren's special
enough already.

415
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:02,125
For no other reason than that
he was born into this world.

416
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:10,541
[KEITH] And you, just
like your father wanted...

417
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,500
...chose to set
your life ablaze,

418
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:17,083
and let it burn to ashes
outside the walls.

419
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:31,166
[KEITH] I tried, but in the
end, it all came to nothing.

420
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,916
I couldn't change a thing.

421
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,750

I'm merely a bystander.
