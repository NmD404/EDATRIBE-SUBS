00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,375
Hey!

180
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,458
If we can't get
Reiner's attention,

181
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,750
we'll have to finish
him off right here!

182
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,750
Our job is to protect
Eren and Armin!

183
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
Yeah. I know that.

184
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,666
We've only got
three Thunder Spears.

185
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,333
That's all, but...

186
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,875
We've gotta try anyway!

187
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,666
Because there's no way we're
gonna win if we don't fight!

188
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,250
[REINER]
Something hit me.

189
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,916
But what?

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,916
A single attack
took out my knee.

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,125
I can't remember much
after that moment.

192
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,750
I'm gonna blow this
whole area away.

193
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,791
If you can, lie down with your
Titan body facing upwards.

194
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,666
[REINER]
Bertholdt.

195
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm confused.

196
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,166
What the hell happened to me?

197
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,166
I don't know what's going on.

198
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,750
I don't have much
strength left, but...

199
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,625
...I do know Eren's over there.

200
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,958
As long as we capture him,

201
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,375
that means we got
what we came for.

202
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,083
[REINER]
Right, Bertholdt?

203
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,333
[REINER] I'll deal with these
idiots as quickly as I can

204
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,291
and then head over
to back you up.

205
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,041
[BERTHOLDT] The four of
them who went that way

206
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,875
must be after Reiner.

207
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,625
So, the only ones who
survived the blast

208
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,791
were the members of the
104th who were with Eren.

209
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,125
[BERTHOLDT] Honestly, I was
hoping they would have all died

210
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,208
in the blast, but...

211
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,291
...I'm used to having to
fight for what I want, Armin.

212
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,791
What's the point of waking Eren

213
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,916
when he's all
battered like that?

214
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,208
[BERTHOLDT]
These are your final moments.

215
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,875
I'm interested to see
how you'll spend them.

216
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,708
The real question is,
how long can I hold out?

217
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,958
It's on me.

218
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,083
If I give up too soon,
the plan will fail,

219
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,541
no matter how good it is.

220
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,958
[EREN gasps]
Hold on.

221
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,541
Armin, are you...?

222
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:02,333
Sorry, but I can't die till I
get a chance to look at the sea.

223
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:06,250
So I'll have to let go before
things get really bad, okay?

224
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,958
The rest will be up to you.

225
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,625
No big surprise.

226
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,666
I mean, I've never
exactly been a hero, so...

227
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,500
[EREN]
No. You're wrong.

228
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,125
You just can't see what I do.

229
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,958
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

230
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,291
In all the years we've
known each other,

231
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,166
have I ever lied to you?

232
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,291
And I promised that we'd
go to the sea together.

233
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,208
[ARMIN]
So no matter what happens,

234
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,750
stick to my plan till the end.

235
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,125
[EREN gasps]
Shit.

236
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,333
[BOTH gasp]

237
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,625
[ARMIN]
Eren!

238
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,791
I knew it.

239
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,750
This battle's already been won.

240
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,375
He probably has a
severe concussion.

241
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,166
I doubt he can even
stand up on his own.

242
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
[BERTHOLDT]
Enough of this.

243
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,833
Let's end it.

244
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,791
[growls]

245
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:21,166
[ARMIN yelling]

246
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,208
[grunts]

247
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,333
[BERTHOLDT]
Armin.

248
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:34,083
You fought well to the very end.

249
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,000
But it's over now.

250
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,750
Eren! Armin!

251
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,541
No. They have their own job.

252
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,833
We need to focus on Reiner.

253
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,083
[JEAN]
If we're going to take him out

254
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,041
with just three Thunder Spears,

255
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,291
this is the only way.

256
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,291
We'll initiate the attack
while he still can't move.

257
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,000
It might not work.

258
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,291
But win or lose, this ends now.

259
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,166
[REINER]
Bring it on.

260
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,708
[JEAN yells]

261
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:14,791
[JEAN]
Reiner!

262
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,583
[JEAN]
First, I act as bait.

263
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,708
[gasps]

264
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,125
[JEAN]
Conny and Sasha will follow

265
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,083
with two of the remaining
Thunder Spears.

266
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,166
and aim for Reiner's
jaw from both sides!

267
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,375
[CONNY yells]

268
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,458
Sasha!

269
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,791
Jean!

270
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,416
[MIKASA]
One of them missed.

271
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,541
[JEAN]
If we blow off his jaw,

272
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,708
that should leave
Reiner's mouth wide open.

273
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,000
Mikasa should be able to
aim the last Thunder Spear

274
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,583
at his nape from
inside the mouth.

275
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,500
[MIKASA]
It's not open.

276
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,666
Doesn't matter.

277
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,875
I have to try anyway.

278
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,041
[BERTHOLDT]
I don't understand.

279
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,666
How is he still holding on?

280
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,541
His anchor should've come loose.

281
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,333
He shouldn't even be
able to get this close!

282
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,291
[ARMIN]
I knew it.

283
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,125
His bones aren't being consumed!

284
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,750
The anchors stay put if
they're not in muscle!

285
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,750
But most importantly,
he's stationary.

286
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,875
He can't move his body
while he's emitting steam!

287
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,250
[BERTHOLDT]
Really, Armin?

288
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,416
This is how you want it to end?

289
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,833
Smart as you are,

290
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,833
this is the best plan
you could come up with?

291
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,541
Flailing in midair.

292
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,500
Being scorched to death.

293
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,500
[ARMIN]
I can't breathe!

294
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,958
I have to let go.

295
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,375
No! Not yet! It's not enough!

296
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,291
I have to keep fighting.

297
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,625
Buy more time!

298
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,291
[BERTHOLDT]
What's the point of this?

299
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,750
A diversion?

300
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,125
But Eren's still collapsed
there on the ground.

301
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,208
Mikasa and the others

302
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,000
have their hands
full with Reiner.

303
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,250
Just a last, desperate act.

304
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,958
All right.

305
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,666
If this really is
the end for you,

306
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,125
I'll do my best
to make it quick.

307
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,750
[ARMIN screams]

308
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,583
[ARMIN]
Hold on!

309
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,166
Don't let go!

310
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,541
Entrust it all to Eren.

311
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,291
[ARMIN]
My dreams.

312
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,833
My life.

313
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,416
Everything!

314
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,750
The only thing I have
to give is this!

315
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,666
[ARMIN]
He'll make it.

316
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,708
Someday... Eren...

317
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,833
...will reach the sea.

318
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,875
[ARMIN]
He'll reach the sea...

319
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,291
[ARMIN]
...for both of us!

320
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,750
[CONNY]
Mikasa! It's too risky!

321
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,041
[HANGE]
No, it's perfect!

322
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,208
[CONNY gasps]

323
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,750
[HANGE grunts]

324
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,000
[ALL gasp]

325
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,666
[MIKASA]
Hange!

326
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,250
Now's your chance! Get him!

327
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,125
No, she can't!

328
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,708
Reiner!

329
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,583
It's over!

330
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,583
[BERTHOLDT]
It's over.

331
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,666
Now, it's just Eren
and the horses.

332
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,958
[gasps]

333
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,041
[BERTHOLDT]
What the?

334
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,166
A hardened Titan?

335
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,500
[BERTHOLDT gasps]

336
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,833
Gotcha!

337
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,958
[yells]

338
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,333
[BERTHOLDT]
It was a diversion!

339
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,583
Eren tricked me into thinking
he was out of the fight.

340
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,000
Armin was buying him time,

341
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,541
giving him the
chance to harden--

342
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,541
to make a replica
Titan in his place.

343
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,500
[BOTH gasp]

344
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:38,666
[BERTHOLDT] They did it...
to make me lower my guard.

345
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,791
So Eren... could
sneak up behind me...

346
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,458
...and attack.

347
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,375
In all the years we've
known each other,

348
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,416
have I ever lied to you?

349
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:20,041
Dammit. I should've
known how far he'd go.

350
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,541
[ARMIN crying]

351
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,291
[EREN] Hey, why don't
you put up a fight?

352
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,125
Huh?

353
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,333
They pick on you 'cause
you won't hit back.

354
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,541
