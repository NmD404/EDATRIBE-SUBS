00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,666
[GRISHA] The fateful day
that I, just a naive youth,

3
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,666
was made to face the
truth of this world.

00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:09,875
Grisha.

10
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,208
It's all right, Fay.

11
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,833
We've heard worse before.

12
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,833
Look there!

13
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,000

00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,000
[GRISHA gasps]
Uh, yes, sir!

18
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,416
[KRUGER] You're from the
Liberio Internment Zone?

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,958
Let's see your exit permit.

20
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,333
Huh? Our permit?

21
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,750
We don't have one.

22
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,875
[KRUGER] If you entered the
city without permission,

23
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,625
then you need to be punished.

[GRISHA]
Yes, sir.

00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,000
Hard labor? Or a quick beating?

26

That's right.

[KRUGER]
Wait.

45
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,125
You came to see
the airship, right?

You may as well do
it while you can.

00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,750
[GRISHA]
The next day, my sister...

48
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,791
...was found on the
banks of the river.

49
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,125
[GROSS] I showed the girl
to the gates of Liberio

50
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,708
and then I went on my way.

51
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,791
I was busy with work, you see.

52
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,500
And Eldian children shouldn't
be roaming about the city

53
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,750
without permits
in the first place.

54
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,333
I find it disturbing that
your son doesn't know

55
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,208
what it means to be
of his bloodline.

56
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,625
I mean, you have
been teaching him

57
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,166
so that he can feel the weight
of your ancestor's sins,

58
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,541
now haven't you?

59
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,125
[GRISHA]
I couldn't prove it,

60
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,458
but I knew that man from
Marley Public Security

61
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,625
was lying through his teeth.

62
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:33,875
We had stumbled upon him

63
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
while he was slacking
off on the riverbank.

64
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,541
How busy could he have been?

65
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,041
Mother was silent in
her grief, but father...

66
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,250
[GRISHA'S FATHER]
Please allow me to thank you

67
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,583
for your guidance, sir.

68
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,125
I assure you, I'll heed it

69
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,291
and teach my foolish
son to know better.

70
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,416
[GRISHA]
He demeaned himself to this man.

71
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,083
I began to hate that
Marleyan, and my father,

72
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,625
so much that it
made my head spin.

73
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,625
But more than that,
I cursed my own foolishness.

74
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,375
[GRISHA'S FATHER]
1,820 years ago,

75
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,416
our ancestor Ymir Fritz
made a contract

76
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,375
with the Devil of All Earth,

77
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,000
and obtained the
Power of the Titans.

78
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,250
Upon her death,

79
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,416
Ymir's spirit was split
into the Nine Titans.

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,916
These Titans defeated the
great nation of Marley,

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,291
and conquered the continent
for themselves,

82
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,875
under the name of
the Eldian Empire.

83
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,791
Thus did this land's
Dark Ages begin.

84
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,166
The subjects of Ymir

85
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,791
deemed all the other races
inferior to their own,

86
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,708
and violently oppressed them.

87
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,583
They stole wealth and land,

88
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,916
forced other people to
bear their children,

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,458
and wiped out some
bloodlines entirely.

90
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,791
This ethnic cleansing continued
for around 1,700 years.

91
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,458
But the fallen nation of Marley

92
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,750
planned to use Eldia's arrogance
to bring it down from within.

93
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,291
And it worked.

94
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,166
Marley brought seven of the
Nine Titans under its control

95
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,625
and used them to win the Great
Titan War just 80 years ago!

96
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,125
The Eldian King at the time

97
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,000
erected three walls on
the island of Paradis,

98
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,958
and he fled there along with
a great many of his people.

99
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,750
Our ancestors were abandoned

100
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,375
and left behind on
the mainland, but,

101
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,208
despite our history,
the gracious people of Marley

102
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,833
let us live and stay
on their land.

103
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,000
[GRISHA]
My father was talkative

104
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,375
for someone who had just
lost his daughter.

105
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,375
As he stood there,
shaming his forebears,

106
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,625
and idolizing his oppressors,

107
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,666
he looked just like
a whipped dog.

108
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,041
That officer was telling lies.

109
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,625
[BOTH gasp]

110
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,791
The truth was inconvenient for
him, so he told lies instead.

111
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,708
Quiet. The walls of this
house are paper thin.

112
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,541
Know what?

113
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,875
He prob'ly took Fay and--

114
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,333
Silence!

115
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,291
[GRISHA'S FATHER]
I told you.

116
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,125
Our ancestors were heinous
sinners, understand?

117
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,916
They committed genocide
against all other races--

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,958
Fay and I didn't do
anything like that!

119
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,791
We were just walking outside!

120
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,708
[GRISHA sobs]

121
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,250
Why are you doing this?

122
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,625
What's wrong with you?

123
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,458
Why are you so eager to
get us all shipped away?

124

[gasps]

125
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,250
[GRISHA'S FATHER]
We ourselves did nothing.

126
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,708
But to those who've been
victimized for generations,

127
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,333
you and I are
devils nonetheless.

128
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,125
We should count ourselves lucky

129
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,375
that they let us live
quiet, humble lives

130
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,583
here in the internment zone.

131
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,791
I beg you, Grisha,

132
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,625
please don't force the
rest of this family

133
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,875
to meet the same fate as Fay.

134
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,791
[GRISHA] I still wonder
which was truly in the wrong.

135
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,041
The world I lived in? Or me?

136
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,458
[GRISHA]
'Kay.

137
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,958
I understand.

138
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,791
[GRISHA]
Perhaps it was both.

139
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,291
[GRISHA]
I was ignorant and foolish.

140
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:49,125
[GRISHA] The world was twisted
and maddeningly unfair.

141
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,375
[GRISHA]
I discovered my own path in life

142
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,458
when I was 18 years old.

143
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,833
It was around the time I was to
take over my father's clinic.

144
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,000
[GRISHA] What's that
scar on your shoulder?

145
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,500
This is what marks
me as a patriot.

146
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,541
[GRISHA]
Hm? A patriot?

147
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,666
[GRICE]
Your sister was killed

148
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,791
by a Marleyan Public
Security officer.

149
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:12,875
[gasps]

150
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,333
That's a verified fact

151
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,125
from our informant
in the government.

152
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,791
There are some things
that you need to hear.

153
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,666
[GRISHA]
It can't be!

154
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,750
How could they do that?

155
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,333
[GRISHA] When I learned the
truth of my sister's death,

156
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,375
I swore to myself...

157
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,041
[GRISHA]
...that I'd show these Marleyans

158
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,708
who the real devils were.

159
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,916
I saw that my ancestors'
so-called sins were justified.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,958
That to set the world
right as it had been,

161
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,833
Eldia would have to be restored.

162
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,541
[GRISHA] Our informant within
the Marleyan Government

163
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,708
was called "The Owl."

164
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,583
He led the Restorationists
without ever showing himself.

165
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,375
Come. I've discovered the truth!

166
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,625
Our ancestor Ymir awakened
the Power of the Titans,

167
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,000
and used it to tame the
wilderness, carve out roads,

168
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,333
and to make bridges
to span the mountains!

169
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,958
She didn't oppress other people,
she helped them to prosper!

170
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,666
[COMRADE 57B] So the history
we were taught as children

171
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,375
was just a hoax!
Marleyan propaganda!

172
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,666
Impressive, Grisha.

173
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,708
How'd you read this
ancient language?

174
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,458
Oh, no. I haven't deciphered
much of the writing at all yet.

175
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,500
Then how do you know
that all this is true?

176
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,750
Huh? Because it's obvious
just from looking!

177
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,833
And because I believe
in our founder Ymir

178
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,125
with all of my heart!

179
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,541
We're not devil-bloods,
we're God's children!

180
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,000
[COMRADES]
Yeah!

181
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,541
My comrades!

182
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,875
The Owl's sent us a new ally.

183
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,750
[DINA]
Hello. It's good to meet you.

184
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,625
I am here as a descendant
of the royal family.

185
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,458
The last on this continent.

186
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,125
Dina Fritz.

187
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,375
[GRISHA]
When we locked eyes,

188
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,125
I decided to allow fate to
steer my life where it would.

189
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,208
[GRISHA] Dina was all
that remained of a branch

190
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,666
of the royal family that
refused to flee the continent.

191
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,291
She taught us secrets
about the Titans

192
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,375
that only royalty
had known before.

193
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,875
We believed that she had
shown us the path to victory.

194
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,666
[GRISHA]
I'm sure of it!

195
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,708
The King brought the Founding
Titan's power into the walls!

196
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,416
If we take that power, then we
can control all other Titans,

197
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,666
and crush Marley
once and for all!

198
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,333
But wait, if the King was able
to wield such an absolute power,

199
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,666
then why'd he run away
in the first place?

200
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,791
[DINA] That's simple. It's
because he refused to fight.

201
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,166
In the midst of the
Great Titan War,

202
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,583
the 145th King forsook his duty

203
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,833
to restore order
on the continent,

204
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,666
and moved his capital
to a distant island.

205
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,041
All our pain, all these
years of anguish,

206
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,541
it can all be traced
to the moment

207
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,958
our King renounced conflict.

208
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,875
Let's fight again.

209
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,375
[DINA gasps]

210
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,375
The true royal family stayed
right here on the continent

211
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,125
and held their ground for Eldia!

212
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,291
It's time we brought the
Founding Titan back to them!

213
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,333
Against its power,
Marley will crumble.

214
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,458
We'll restore Eldia and
live proudly once more!

215
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,083
[ALL yelling]

216
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,708
[GRISHA] The next year,
the two of us married,

217
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,875
and were blessed with a son.

218
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,083
His name was Zeke.

219
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,125
Our royal child, Zeke.

220
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,500
There's no doubt in my heart

221
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,625
that that someday he'll
lead his people to victory.

222
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,458
[GRISHA] Years pass by,
and people change.

223
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,583
As the world around
us rapidly advanced,

224
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,791
a turning point came
for the Restorationists.

225
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,958
Now, listen up, you Eldians!

226
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,458
We'll soon begin
recruiting new...

227
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,708
[GRISHA] The Marleyan government
required Subjects of Ymir

228
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,625
to become Marleyan warriors

229
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,958
capable of serving as
vessels for the Nine Titans.

230
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,750
[GRISHA] We've received a
new message from the Owl.

231
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,416
He says the reason Marley's
making these moves

232
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,791
is to prepare for an anticipated
struggle over resources

233
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,916
as military technology
keep advancing.

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
Marley currently leads the world

235
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,583
using the power of
its Seven Titans,

236
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,625
but they may soon grow obsolete.

237
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,250
An enormous cache of fossil
fuel lies beneath Paradis.

238
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,250
Marley can't afford
to let it lie unused.

239
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,125
But, 80 years ago,

240
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,958
the King of the walls
left behind this warning.

241
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,541
"If you ever interfere
with our affairs,

242
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,041
the millions upon millions of
Titans sleeping within the walls

243
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,708
will flatten the entire world."

244
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,541
As long as he can
make this threat,

245
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,000
none dare to confront him,
at least not directly.

246
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:47,125
So, the Marleyan government
has the same objective as we do.

247
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,291
They'll try to
infiltrate Paradis,

248
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,375
and then seize the Founding
Titan for themselves.

249
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,125
[COMRADE 57D]
What do we do?

250
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,291
With things as they are...

251
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,375
Yeah. Marley'll
get it before us.

252
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,750
If they actually do it,

253
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,291
we'll lose any chance we had
of bringing Eldia back!

254
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,875
It's bad, but we still
have a path forward.

255
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,708
I'll send my son, Zeke,
to become a Marleyan warrior.

256
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,125
You see, Zeke?

257
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,916
Almost everything
that you've been told

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,541
by the Marleyans was wrong.

259
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,708
But you have to obey
their every order,

260
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,416
and you have to do it
better and faster

261
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,875
than anyone else around you.

262
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,333
All of us here are
counting on you

263
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,666
to save Eldia from disgrace.

'Kay. I understand.

265
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,750
[GRISHA] But I should've
known, better than anyone,

266
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,125
what a wretched sin it is

267
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,041
to impose your beliefs
on your children.

268
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,916
[GRISHA] I saw him as
a child of royal blood--

269
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,375
as Eldia's greatest hope.

270
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,458
But did I ever see him as Zeke?

271
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,375
As the boy he was?

272
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,291
[GRISHA]
At any rate,

273
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,291
Zeke chose to protect himself,
as well as his grandparents,

274
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,875
by turning in both of his
naive, foolish parents

called Paradis.

become a pure Titan.
