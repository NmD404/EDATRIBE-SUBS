00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,291
I was born on a small farmstead

3
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,833
in the northern lands
of Wall Rose.

4
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,958
It was owned by
the noble Reiss family.

5
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,916
As far back as I can remember,

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,416
I was helping out
around the farm.

7
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,583
But my mother was
always reading books.

8
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,125
She didn't care to work.

9
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,041
And no one cared to make her.

10
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,333
She was a beautiful woman.

11
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,333
Most nights, someone would
come for her in a carriage,

12
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:31,791
and she'd go off into the city,
wearing fancy clothes.

[HORSE neighs]

14
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,500
[CHRISTA] For me, that was
just life as I knew it.

15
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,000
But when I learned
to read and write,

16
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,291
I started picking up books
to imitate my mother.

17
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,750
And they taught me
just how alone I was.

18
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,708
In all the stories
I read in those books,

19
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,125
parents cared
about their children.

20
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:58,541
They talked to them,
hugged them, scolded them.

21
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:03,208
I had never experienced
any of those things.

22
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,916
One day, out of curiosity,

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,708
I decided to try
hugging my mother.

24
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:13,041
I guess I just wanted to see
what kind of face she'd make.

25
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,750
--[CHRISTA] Mommy!
--[ALMA gasps]

27
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,291
[CHRISTA] She ended up
shoving me away from her.

28
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:28,291
But that was the first time
my mother had acknowledged me.

29
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,000
So it actually made me happy.

30
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:37,833
If only I wasn't such a coward,
I could've killed it.

31
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:46,625
[CHRISTA] Those were the first
words my mother ever said to me.

32
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,500
She went to live
somewhere else after that.

33
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,041
I didn't see her
for a long time.

34
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,875
And then, five years ago,

35
00:03:55,958 --> 00:04:00,083
just a few days after
Wall Maria fell...

36
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,541
...I finally met my father.

37
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,666
Historia. My name's Rod Reiss.

38
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,875
I wish that we
could've met sooner.

The mother I hadn't
seen in years

44
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,125
looked terribly frightened.

45
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:27,333
Now, listen. You'll be living
with me from this day forth.

47
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,208
[KENNY] You know
what this is, Lord Reiss.

48
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,708
The fall of Wall Maria's
got you acting a bit reckless.

49
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,166
I suppose you thought you'd get
your pretty little secrets

50
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,791

I've never even met her!

Do whatever you want
with her, but let me go!

55
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,291
Oh? You have anything to
say about that, Lord Reiss?

56
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,208
Maybe it's just a coincidence
the three of you

57
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,708
are out here at the same time.

58
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,625
[ROD sighs]
So be it.

59
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,750
That's correct--these two
have nothing to do with me.

60
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,750
I thought that
might be the case.

[ALMA gasps]
Wait? What are you--?

62
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,833
You were never employed
at this estate.

63
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,583
And nobody here
has ever heard your name.

64
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,708
Sounds to me like
you don't exist.

No, I-- Master, please!

66
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,166
That isn't true,
you have to tell them!

67
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,708
What are they... doing? Mother?

68
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:42,333
If only you had never
been born, I could--

69
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,416
[CHRISTA] Those were the last
words my mother ever said.

70
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,166
No. Wait.

71
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,750
[CHRISTA] Moments before
I was killed myself,

72
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,291
my father proposed an idea.

73
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,750
That if I were
sent somewhere far away,

74
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,958
to live out a quiet life,

75
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,958
perhaps they could spare me.

76
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,833
Your new name will be...

forgiveness, child.

Please know that
everything I've done

80
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,375
I did to protect you.

[ROD] Not a day has passed
that I haven't thought of you.

Long have I dreamed of a day
when I could hold you like this.

You are special.
The blood of the king

85

Is that true?

87

[ROD]
Yes, Historia.

88

The true royal bloodline is
carried by the Reiss family.

And as its heir, the power
to save all of humanity

We forced Ralph here to read
off this script at knifepoint.

109
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,458
It was staged.

I'm the one who betrayed
the king's secret.

You. You're a devil.

115
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,541
Yes, I think you might
be right about that.

116
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,583
But I bet Pastor Nick felt
the exact same way about you.

117
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,083
That's why I felt
sorry for you, Sannes.

118
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,416
Not because your nails
got plucked out,

119
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,333
but because of what
you've done with your life.

120
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,666
You're pathetic! A grown-ass
man wailing like an infant!

121
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,875
Are ya sad now? Well, boo hoo!

122
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,791
You get to spend the rest
of your lives doing nothing

123
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,583

It's your turn.

126
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,583
There's an order
to these things.

127
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,250
Perhaps it's a law
of human nature.

128
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,541
When one's time is over,
another must take on

129
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,875
the role that they used to play.

130
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,750
And thus, the world can
never be cleansed of it.

131
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,166

I'm sorry. Seems I made a mess.

137
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,083
I encountered a large cockroach.

138
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,291
I see. Well, as hard
as you kicked it,

139
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,958
I bet it learned its lesson.

140
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,291
It's time you filled them in.

141
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,458
Oh, yeah.
I guess I might as well.

142
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,250
So they plan to eat Eren?

143
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,125
[HANGE] Yeah. Eren remembered
a conversation between

144
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,291
Ymir and Bertholdt.

145
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,541
[YMIR]
You hold that against me?

146
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,458
I don't think so.

147
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,875
I mean, I don't know.

148
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,958
Suppose I have to believe you
didn't want to eat anyone.

149
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,375
Based on this, we can speculate.

150
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,541
Ymir used to be a mindless
Titan just like the others.

151
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,500
Until she consumed someone.

152
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,083
Someone from Bertholdt
and Reiner's group.

153
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,458
We've never seen a Titan
turn back into a human

154
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,083
by eating one before.

155
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,375
That said, Reiner's comrades
aren't normal humans.

156
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,708
And there's a
different set of rules

157
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,000
for humans that can
turn into Titans.

158
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,625
My thought is this:
If a Titan eats someone

159
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,750
with that power, then it'll
transform back into a human.

160
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,541
What's more, they'll obtain
whatever powers that human had.

161
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,041
In the other day's battle,
Reiner was throwing Titans

162
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,208
at Eren as he tried to run away.

163
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,291
He knew that Eren had
the power to take command

164
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,458
of feral Titans with his scream.

165
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,458
If Eren's death would've
meant that power was lost,

166
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,125
he wouldn't have risked it.

167
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,625
I think he hoped one of
those Titans would eat Eren

168
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,333
and take his power.

169
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:51,666
My point is, if the government
has a Titan of their own,

170
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,083
they'll use it to eat Eren.

171
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,500
Calm down. I know you
wanna get Eren back,

172
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,916
but going on a rampage
won't help with that.

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,791
Anyway, we're heading for
Rod Reiss' estate.

174
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,708
Prepare to leave at once.

175
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,166
[ARMIN, CONNY, SASHA, JEAN]
Sir!

176
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,041
[HANGE] I'll go tell Erwin
everything we've learned

177
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,041
about the Reiss family.

178
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,583
I'm sure he's waiting
to hear from us.

179
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,958
[LEVI]
Right.

180
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,041
[HANGE]
You head for Lord Reiss' estate.

181
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,125
I'll find you when I can.

182
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,791
[knocking]

183
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,166
Pardon, sir, but the
commander of the Garrison

184
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,833
has just arrived.

185
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,166
Pyxis?

186
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,791
[SOLDIER 40A] Yes, he's asking
to speak with you.

187
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,833
--Very well, then.
--Sir!

188
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,416
Forgive me for
dropping in unannounced.

189
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,791
But I just couldn't
stand still, you see.

190
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,791
I finished reading your letter.

191
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,916
And I have a few
thoughts of my own.

192
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:03,291
But first, I have to ask.
You are serious, right?

193
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:08,208
Yes. I have a plan
to retake Wall Maria

194
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,250
and to depose the government.

195
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,375
[PYXIS] Mm. I knew
this would happen someday.

196
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,875
The state could only hold
people in this cramped world

197
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,291
for so long before
they began to lash out.

198
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,416
And I knew that
when the time came,

199
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,916
I would have to point my gun
at the king I'm sworn to serve.

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,625
Should a certain hunch
of mine prove to be correct,

201
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,041
it may be possible for us
to carry out this plan

202
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,958
without military force.

203
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,166
My objective, at least,
is a bloodless coup.

204
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,000
Ahh. Then by all means, go on.

205
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,458
If such an option
is plausible, I'm for it.

206
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,958
Well, the catch is that
the groundwork for this

207
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,250
has yet to be laid out.

208
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,750
And if things don't go
as I think they will,

209
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,500
there's no plan B. I, and
everyone else, will be hanged.

210
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,125
Oh. Is that all?

211
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,291
So this is another one of
your great gambles, then.

212
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,500
Seems I may be a
betting man to the end.

213
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,875
I expect the news
to come shortly.

214
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,916
If you care to wait,
I'd like you to hear

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,375
a story from my childhood.

216
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,083
Huh?

217
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,416
About my father.
He was a teacher.

Damn. Too bad.

220

221
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,666
I saw it. Keep moving!

[ERWIN]
I thought as much.

227
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,083
Looks like my gamble
might pay off, Commander.

228
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,416
Might.

229
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,208
One of the First Interior
Squad just confessed.

230
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,208
The current king is
a pretender to the throne.

231
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,166
Reiss is the true royal family.

232
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,875
Are you sure?

233
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,625
I've deployed my scouts.

234
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,500
They're working to retrieve
Eren and Historia.

235
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,666
Once they're secured,
we'll declare that

236
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,666
Historia Reiss
is of royal blood.

237
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,416
And crown her as
this country's queen.

238
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,125
[BOTH gasp]

239
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,208
Knowing this is true, the ersatz
king will have no choice

240
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,583
but to give up the throne.

241
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:29,291
Assuming that he does, we'll
have staged a bloodless coup.

242
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,291
Then we'll go to the people
and expose the system

243
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,625
that claimed to protect them
for all its lies.

244
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:41,083
I'm convinced. You can
count on my support.

245
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,833
That said. We could be
in the wrong.

246
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,208
The final decision
is out of our hands.

247
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,125
You do understand that,
don't you?

248
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,833
I do. Yes.

[HANGE] Anything come
of the Reiss investigation?

251
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,041
I found out as much as I could.

252
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,375
Not much to speak of.
Just one curious incident.

253
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,583
Huh.

254

They're making a scene in
the middle of the city, sir.

258
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,708
What?

259
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:19,958
It would appear that the enemy

260
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,000
has been making
plans of their own.

[CROWD whispering]

272
00:15:55,916 --> 00:16:00,416
I take it you know
who this is. Right, Erwin?

273
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,583
[ERWIN]
That's Mr. Dimo Reeves.

274
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,625
He was the head of
the Reeves company.

275
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,458
Just yesterday,
at this exact location,

276
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,708
Eren Jaeger was abducted by
a group of Reeves' lackeys.

277
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,750
However, Reeves was hired
to do this by none other

278
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,458
than the Scouts themselves,
in the hopes that they might

279
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:21,250
avoid handing Eren Jaeger
over to the government.

280
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,416
And then, when Reeves had
outlived his usefulness,

281
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,291
they killed him
to stop him from talking.

282
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,250
The murderer is still at large.

283
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,166
We presume they have Jaeger.

284
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,750
What a convenient story
that would be.

285
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,000
I can see what you
scoundrels are doing.

286
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,500
You're trying to monopolize
Jaeger's Titan power

287
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,041
and keep it all for yourselves.

288
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,375
That type of action
violates clause six

289
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,250
of the Charter of Humanity.

290
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,708
I trust that you're
familiar with that law?

291
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,583
One must never
prioritize their own gain

292
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,208
over humanity's survival.
Am I correct?

293
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,791
That you are.

294
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,375
And because the Scout Regiment
is in violation of this law,

295
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,916
all Scouts must be arrested.

296
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,625

satisfy the fat cats.

for Trost first began,

Mr. Reeves delayed
evacuation efforts

in order to preserve his wealth.

310

Yeah? So, what's your point?

311
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,583
Are you trying to say
he deserved to die?

312
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,541
No, I'm not. Because upon
his return to Trost,

313
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,000
he found it on
the verge of collapse.

314
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,791
And instead of abandoning it,
he planted his feet.

315
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,250
He helped those
who couldn't leave

316
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,041
by striving to revive this city.

317
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,708
But now, that dream
has been cut short

318
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,583
by a knife in the dark.

319
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,125
I swear this...

320
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,125
...I will avenge him.

321
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:33,541
[ERWIN]
My father. He was a teacher.

322
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,208
One day, we were
studying history.

323
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,916
"Faced with the annihilation
at the hands of Titans,

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,083
humanity took refuge
behind the walls,

325
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,083
and realized 100 years of peace.

326
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,458
But in this process,
we lost all records of what

327
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,625
humanity's earlier past
might've looked like."

328
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,708
That's what all of us
were taught.

329
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,750
Even back then,
this seemed strange to me.

330
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,833
And so, I asked
my father a question.

331
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,458
He gave me a fairly
evasive answer

332
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,208
and continued with
the standard lesson.

333
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,583
But, when we
got home that night,

334
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,833
he sat me down and
gave me the real answer.

335
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,541
He told me the
history books he received

336
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,791
from the government were full
of contradictions and mysteries.

337
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,875
He then proceeded to
tell me a theory of his.

338
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,375
Even as a child,
I was astounded.

339
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,625
There was a reason
he didn't share that theory

340
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,750
with the entire class, but I
wasn't smart enough to see it.

341
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,958
I told the other children
what he had told me.

342
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:42,375
And one day, the MPs
arrived to question me.

343
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,958
My father didn't
come home that night.

344
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,458
They said he died in
some kind of freak accident.

345
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,458
But I knew that wasn't true.

346
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,958
He'd been silenced
by the government.

347
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,250
One hundred seven years ago,

348
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,416
when humanity fled
to these walls,

349
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,375
the king altered
their collective memory

350
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,000
to make them easier to rule.

351
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,500
That was my father's theory.

352
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,541
Yes. I can see why
the first king might do that.

353
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,208
He must've believed that
such knowledge

354
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,916
would lead to civil strife.

355
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,250
Yes. But ever since I was
a child, I've asked myself:

356
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,333
Why would the government
have to kill my father

357
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,125
for nothing more than
getting close to the truth?

358
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,041
Despite the cruelty of it,

359
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,750
I'd hoped their motives
at least might've been noble.

360
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:31,958
But more recently, I've realized
something about these men.

361
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,958
What they're fighting
to protect is not humanity.

362
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,708
But their own gardens,
houses, and lands.

363
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:42,291
Which means, all they care
about is suppressing those

364
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,916
who dare to question
their authority in any way.

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,458
I no longer believe that
there was any justification

366
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,833
for my father's death.

367
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,166
He was killed by human greed.

368
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,750
And by the sheer stupidity
of his own son.

369
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,541
I can't tell you why,
but I know in my gut

370
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,791
that my father's words
were true.

life to atone to my father

he was right.
