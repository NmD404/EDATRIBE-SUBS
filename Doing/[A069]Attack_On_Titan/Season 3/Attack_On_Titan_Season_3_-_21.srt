00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,833
and run past the gate that day,

175
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,541
you would've ended up running
your father's clinic,

176
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,125
and your sister might
be married by now.

177
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,541
She might even
have had children.

178
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,458
But you'll never know what
she would've become.

179
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,291
Ever since you tread forbidden
ground and took her with you.

180
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:31,041
Ever since the day I first
kicked a patriot off this wall.

181
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,416
We've known that we'd
have to keep fighting

182
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
to pay for our sins.

183
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,416
Even in death. Even after.

184
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,375
[KRUGER]
That's right.

185
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,166
You chose to start this story.

186
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,250
[KRUGER] Each of the Nine Titans
has a name to describe it,

187
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:09,083
and that includes the one
you're about to inherit from me.

188
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:13,750
Throughout history, this Titan's
marched in the vanguard.

189
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,208
It has ever pushed forward,
seeking freedom.

190
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,916
And for freedom's
sake... it fights.

191
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,708
Therefore...

192
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,958
...it's called the Attack Titan.

193
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,291
What's that all about?

194
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,541
"It's called the Attack Titan."

195
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,916
That's what you
just did, remember?

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,833
No.

197
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,208
[HANGE]
Huh?! Come on! He did!

198
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,250
Am I the only one who saw him?

199
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,541
No, but... I think he was just--

200
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,541
[HANGE] Just what? Who the
hell were you talking to?

201
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,083
No one. It's nothing.

202
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,125
You said the name of
your Titan, right?

203
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,500
Are ya practicing ways
to introduce him, or--?

204
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,083
Let it go, Hange.

205
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,500
He's 15 years old. We all go
through a phase like this.

206
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,041
[HANGE] A phase where we mutter
weird crap while posing?

207
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,625
[ARMIN] Hange, I'll
explain it to you later.

208
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,416
It's not right with him in here.

209
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,166
[HANGE]
Oh, it's that kinda phase.

210
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,833
What the hell do you want?!

211
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:18,666
Get out.

212
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,000
What?

213
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,666
But I'm not done. I still
have ten full days left.

214
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,375
I'm satisfied.

215
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,416
Hange just gave you
ten days worth of pain.

216
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,833
We talked it all over with
Premier Zachary, so don't worry.

217
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,208
If we keep the brave heroes

218
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,541
who toppled the Armored and
Colossal Titans jailed,

219
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,916
it kinda sends a bad
message, you know?

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,791
Plus, you were only
defying the morons

221
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,083
who had the Beast and Armored
Titans at their mercy

222
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,333
but let them get away!

223
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,333
That isn't true.

224
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,083
[EREN]
Did you lose some weight?

225
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,666
That's odd.
We had plenty to eat.

226
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,750
You look... well enough.

227
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,958
Yeah, I guess.

228
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,041
[LEVI]
Let's go.

229
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,625
Get dressed already.

230
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,791
Wait, where are
we going, Captain?

231
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,625
A state meeting.

232
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,125
Her Majesty has come to Trost.

233
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,583
[YMIR]
To my dear Historia.

234
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,166
As I write this, Reiner's
standing at my side.

235
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,250
He knows this is a love letter,
but he's still sneaking peeks.

236
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,041
Honestly. It's no wonder
the creep's still single.

237
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,791
That said, he did
give me his word

238
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,333
that he'd deliver
this letter to you.

239
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:40,708
He says he owes me for the time
I doubled back to save him.

240
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,166
I'm sorry about then.

241
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:49,000
I never would've imagined myself
choosing those two over you.

242
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:54,541
I'm going to die soon,
but I'll die without regrets.

243
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,708
Or that's what I'd like to say.

244
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,583
Truth is, I do have one.

245
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,125
It's that I never
got to marry you.

246
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,750
With love, Ymir.

247
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,750
[CHRISTA gasps]

248
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,250
[EREN]
These paths are countless.

249
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,125
They reach far, and
in many directions,

250
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,125
but they all meet
at one coordinate:

251
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,083
The Founding Titan.

252
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,666
[gasps]

253
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,750
Wait. What was that?

254
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,750
[HANGE]
Something wrong?

255
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,250
No.

256
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,250
I take it this is all she wrote?

257
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,541
Yes.

258
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,041
I doubt that she
would be permitted

259
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,375
to write anything that might
be beneficial to our cause.

260
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,791
Could there be a secret message
that no one can see except you?

261
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,125
Some kind of code?

262
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,791
[CHRISTA]
I don't know.

263
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,625
But frankly, that doesn't
sound like her.

264
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,708
Heh.

265
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,541
That idiot. What's with her?

266
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,583
So ridiculous.

267
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,250
Playing it off whenever
she got embarrassed.

268
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,958
I could never tell with her.

269
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,583
[knocking]

270
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,458
[LEVI]
It's us.

271
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,666
Come in.

272
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,625
Your Grace.

273
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,041
--Your Grace.
--Your Grace.

274
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,958
[CHRISTA]
Oh, stop it. Please.

275
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,291
I'm not actually ruling yet.

276
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,208
But wow. You've been
through so much.

277
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,958
Meanwhile, I've done nothing

278
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,416
but watch the south
sky and wait.

279
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
It's an important duty of yours,
just to keep safe and well.

280
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,916
Yeah. He's right.

281
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,166
Yeah.

282
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,625
[CHRISTA] It's good to
see that you're still

283
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,666
acting like yourselves.

284
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,541
Well, that might just be that
it hasn't sunk in for us yet.

285
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,708
Why don't we get
the ball rolling?

286
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,791
[ZACHARY] <i>The Early Life</i>
<i>of Grisha Yeager</i> ,

287
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,083
<i>The Extent of Our Knowledge</i>
<i>of Titans and Their History</i> ,

288
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,250
and <i>Information About the</i>
<i>World Beyond the Walls</i> .

289
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,583
The only people who
know these books exist

290
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,541
are those who are
in this room now.

291
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,958
These texts were obtained
through the efforts

292
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,750
of the nine Scouts before us,

293
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,583
and the 199 others
who were lost.

294
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,791
On this day, and in
the Queen's presence.

295
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,958
I'd like for all of us to
assess our situation,

296
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,583
and come to an agreement about
our next course of action.

297
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,208
Scout Regiment
Commander, Hange Zoe.

298
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,541
[HANGE]
Sir.

299
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,791
The Scouts have suffered
a brutal, staggering blow.

300
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,291
In exchange for the
lives of many heroes,

301
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,250
including Erwin Smith,

302
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,208
we have retaken Wall Maria

303
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,166
and seized control of
the Colossal Titan,

304
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,166
with all its fearsome strength.

305
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,125
That said, we humans
living inside the walls

306
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,166
have just learned how
precarious our situation is.

307
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,708
I'd be relieved if Titans
were the only monsters

308
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,291
we had for enemies.

309
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:07,250
Unfortunately, the true nature
of the foe we face... is human.

310
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,208
It's a whole civilization.

311
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:13,291
One could say that it's
us against the world.

312
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,958
According to these books,

313
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,750
we're of a special race
that can turn into Titans,

314
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,458
called the Subjects of Ymir.

315
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,000
We ruled the world once,
and some fear we will again.

316
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,791
So despite our past
century of pacifism,

317
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:30,333
most in this world would
like to wipe us out.

318
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,583
[KRUGER] If Marley takes
hold of the Founding Titan,

319
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,166
the Eldian race
will be finished.

320
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,791
But if they try, the king in
the walls will stop them.

321
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,416
The king in the
walls won't fight.

322
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,125
[GRISHA]
Huh?

323
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,791
[KRUGER] "If Eldia is
driven to sin once again,

324
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,375
it shall perish,
as is meant to be.

325
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:57,000
I've made a vow, renouncing war
through the Founding Titan."

326
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,375
He said that to the royal
family still on the continent,

327
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,791
and then he closed his gates.

328
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,000
But what about the Titans

329
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,916
he threatened to send
out from the walls?

330
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,333
It was the last warning he gave.

331
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,083
[KRUGER] Those words were
simply meant to deter an attack.

332
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,875
They afforded him a
brief time of peace.

333
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,583
The king of the walls stole
his people's memories,

334
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:23,333
and told them that beyond the
walls, humanity was gone.

335
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,666
Surrounded by fools
of his making,

336
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,708
he tells them
they're in paradise.

337
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,041
A king that can't protect
his people is no king.

338
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,750
You must find that coward

339
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,583
and strip him of the
Founding Titan's power.

340
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,541
That's the mission
I'm entrusting to you.

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,875
Doctor Jaeger did manage
to achieve this mission,

342
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:48,041
and he passed the Founding
Titan on to his son Eren.

343
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,458
The Founding Titan's full might
can only be brought to bear

344
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,583
when the power is possessed
by someone of royal blood.

345
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,458
However, when a royal comes
to possess the Founding Titan,

346
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,916
they're overpowered by
their ancestor's will,

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,541
and they continue down
the path he set before them.

348
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:10,375
Such is the power of
his vow renouncing war.

349
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:14,500
However, Eren has commanded
Pure Titans once in the past

350
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,625
to escape from a dire situation.

351
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,041
So despite his lack
of royal blood,

352
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,208
it's at least conditionally
possible for Eren

353
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,750
to wield that power, too.

354
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,541
[EREN]
That's right.

355
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:32,708
If only for an instant, it felt
like everything connected.

356
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,541
Why? Why only then?

357
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,333
I'm here as a descendant
of the royal family.

358
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,041
The last that stayed.
My name's Dina Fritz.

359
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,791
--[HANGE gasps]
--There's no way!

360
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,666
You scared me.

361
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,416
What is it? What's wrong?

362
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,291
[EREN]
Oh, uh...

363
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,875
I just...

364
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,875
If you've something to say,
we would be glad to hear it.

365
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,541
Actually, it's nothing.

366
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,666
Huh?

367
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,458
Sorry for interrupting,
Commander.

368
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,458
Oh. I get it now.

369
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,083
That's right.

370
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,958
It would appear
that Jaeger here

371
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,041
is going through
an awkward phase.

372
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,583
He speaks out of turn and often
makes a nuisance of himself.

373
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,291
[ZACHARY]
Ah. I see.

374
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:35,041
That's rather unfortunate.
But he is at that age.

375
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,000
Eren?

376
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:40,375
[EREN] I haven't told those
two about it yet, either.

377
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,833
About how the Titan who killed
my mother and Hannes

378
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:48,083
was actually someone my dad
had been married to.

379
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:52,375
The thing is, I can't
talk about it here.

380
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:56,333
If someone with royal blood
is turned into a Titan,

381
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,125
then it might be possible for me

382
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,875
to use the Founding Titan's
powers while touching them.

383
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:05,583
Who knows... It might
not work at all.

384
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,916
But if the military knew
it was a possibility,

385
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,625
what would they do to Historia?

386
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,875
[KRUGER]
Build a family.

387
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,375
[GRISHA]
Huh?

388
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,833
After you've entered the walls,
you should start a family.

389
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,291
[GRISHA]
What are you talking about?

390
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,458
I'm still married to Dina.

391
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,500
And you're about to
transform me, right?

392
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,875
So won't I just
forget everything

393
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,541
you're telling me now, anyway?

394
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,458
[KRUGER]
That's not always the case.

395
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,583
And it's possible
someone else'll see it.

396
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,083
Huh?

397
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,291
[KRUGER] Be it your wife,
your child, or even a stranger.

398
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,958
Love someone in those walls.

399
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,375
If you can't do that,
it'll only repeat itself.

400
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,541
This cruel history,
these foolish mistakes...

401
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,375
They'll repeat.

402
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,333
You have to see this through.

403
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,958
Complete your mission and
save Mikasa and Armin.

404
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:01,708
Mikasa? Armin? Who are they?

405
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,208
I... I don't know.

406
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,958
They aren't from my memories.

407
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:16,000
♪ Closing Song ♪

408
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:01,083
[NARRATOR] They believed freedom
could be won through war.

409
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,250
Knowing the truth
about humanity,

410
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,750
when they finally reach the sea,

411
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:08,708
what will they make of
the world beyond it?

412
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:11,958

Side of the Wall."
