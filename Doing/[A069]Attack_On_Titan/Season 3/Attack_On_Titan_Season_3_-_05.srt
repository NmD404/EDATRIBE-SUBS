on the Reiss Estate.

345
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,750
Five years?

346
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,416
That's right. It was the day
Wall Maria was breached.

347
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,250
I'll summarize
the most important parts

348
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,666
from the beginning.

349
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,250
So, as far as
regional lords went,

350
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,833
Lord Reiss was fair and
well-respected by the people.

351
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,208
He had five children.
The most well-known of them

352
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,166
was his eldest daughter Frieda.

353
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,583
She was a down-to-earth girl
who even the peasants adored.

354
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,791
But five years ago,
on that night, disaster struck.

355
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,083
With the fall of Wall Maria
having plunged the world

356
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,833
into chaos, bandits
raided and set fire

357
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,083
to the only chapel around.

358
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,833
Unfortunately for them,
the entire Reiss family

359
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,791
had gathered there to pray.

360
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,666
And so, the entire family
was massacred

361
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,750
by bandits that night--save one.

362
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,375
Only Rod Reiss managed
to escape with his life.

363
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,166
To top it all off,
this incident occurred

364
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,291
just a few days
before Historia's mother

365
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,833
was killed by
the Interior Police.

366
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,375
So we know that
in the immediate wake

367
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:58,708
of losing his family,
Rod Reiss sought out Historia.

368
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,541
And something tells me
that it wasn't out of

369
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,375
a newfound paternal affection.

370
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,625
Well, she is of royal blood.

371
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,333
Or do you think that bloodline
has some other secret?

372
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,791
It's possible,
but I'm not sure yet.

373
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,583
What really stood out
to me at least,

374
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:16,041
was the fact that large parts
of the chapel were destroyed.

375
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,958
The chapel was built from stone.

376
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,333
It would take a lot of time
and effort to destroy it.

377
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,500
If it was bandits, they'd have
taken what they could

378
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,250
and made a quick escape.

379
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,458
Also, Lord Reiss
was the only witness.

380
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,125
No one confirmed his story.

381
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,958
Then Lord Reiss
rebuilt the chapel with

382
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,583
his personal fortune
almost immediately.

383
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,416
What was his rush?

384
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,500
When you think about it,

385
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,291
the story could only make sense
if it involved a Titan attack.

386
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,083
It may turn out that
I'm jumping to conclusions,

387
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,750
but it's suspicious enough
to merit investigation,

388
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,291
and it's the only lead we have.

Unfortunately, we can't
