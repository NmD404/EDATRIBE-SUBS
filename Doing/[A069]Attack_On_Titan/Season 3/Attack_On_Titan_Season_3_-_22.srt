[JEAN, CONNY gasp]

177
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,791
[FLOCH]
Medals? For what?

178
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,958
A memorial for who?

179
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,083
When you guys start
rebuilding the Survey Corps,

180
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,125
you'd better tell your
recruits the truth,

181
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,875
or else you'll just end up with
cowards like me in the ranks.

182
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,416
What the hell are
we supposed to do

183
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,666
now that we've lost Erwin?

184
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,458
I know that I'm just fodder.

185
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,875
I understand that my life
is expendable, but still.

186
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,375
I should get to call
it like I see it...

187
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,708
...and to decide if this
cause is worth dying for.

188
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,000
[gasps]

189
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,666
I think Floch is right.

[EREN, MIKASA gasp]

191
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,625
Commander Erwin's the one
who should've been saved.

192
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,416
Maybe he could've turned
this situation around.

193
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,041
I can't though.

194
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,250
[EREN]
How can you be so sure of that?

195
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,291
I don't know what
choice was right,

196
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,333
so I won't pretend to.

197
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,416
None of us know what
the future might hold.

198
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,791
I mean, we can barely imagine.

199
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,583
Think about it.

200
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,791
If we rode straight from Wall
Maria, what would we find?

201
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,583
The sea.

202
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,375
Yeah, that's right.
We'd find the sea.

203
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,625
A place we've only
dreamed about.

204
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,541
Water that glows like
fire, fields of ice,

205
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,291
giant rocks that
take days to climb!

206
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,166
How can we be sure of anything

207
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,625
when there's so much
we haven't seen yet?

208
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,666
On the other side of the wall,

209
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,333
freedom is--

210
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,833
[LEVI]
All right, you brats.

211
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,250
It's time. Line up.

212
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,666
[EREN]
What did we find in that cellar?

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,583
[EREN]
Was it hope?

214
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,375
[EREN]
Or was it just despair?

215
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,625
Our enemy is
tremendously powerful.

216
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,416
If nothing changes
for the better soon,

217
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,250
that calamity will
only repeat itself.

218
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,208
I'd give up my life
in a heartbeat

219

if I was certain
that in doing so,

220
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,166
I could make a difference.

221
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,083
[EREN]
But...

222
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,666
...I'm not about to
sacrifice Historia's.

223
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:13,333
[EREN] I can't tell anyone
about this, so what should I do?

before thousands of your

233
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,916
[NARRATOR]
Hange's "executioner from hell,"

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,583
which had been crushing
Titans day and night,

235
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,000
went silent just as the
snow began to stick.

236
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,500
[NARRATOR] Months later,
when the snow started melting,

237
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,708
the military formally
announced that Wall Maria

238
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,666
had been cleansed
of Titans at last.

239
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,416
[NARRATOR] By the time the
elevators on Trost's walls

240
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,125
were freed for use,

241
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,166
and work had begun on
paving the main road,

242
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,125
there were flowers in bloom,

243
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,708
and butterflies
dancing between them.

244
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,666
[NARRATOR] Maria's refugees
were finally permitted to

245
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,166
return to their homes

246
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,000
roughly a year after
what had been called

247
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,083
"humanity's first
victory" in Trost.

248
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,958

And so, six years after

the Colossal Titan's
first devastating attack...

250
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,541
[NARRATOR] ...the Scouts
resumed their expeditions,

exploring the world beyond
the walls once again.

[LEVI]
It's just as you thought, Hange.

253
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,750
Most of the Titans had
already gone inside Wall Maria.

254
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,291
We've all but wiped them out,

255
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,250
and it only took
us a single year.

256
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,250
Then let's push
straight forward,

257
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,291
exactly as we'd planned.

like it can move much.

Even with those limbs,

266
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,333
it still tried to drag itself
to the wall, bit by bit.

[FLOCH]
Hey! Careful!

268

It was shipped to paradise,

Is it okay to leave this here?

Shouldn't somebody kill it?

Shit!

[EREN]
I'm sure of it.

278
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,666
This is the place where
they'd turn the Eldians Titan.

It's just like I told you.

293

[ARMIN]
A body of water so big

294
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,208
that merchants could
spend their whole lives

295
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,833
and still not get
all the salt out.

296
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,750
That's what I said we'd find,

297

like I was right.

Yeah.

It's so damn big.

freedom's waiting.
