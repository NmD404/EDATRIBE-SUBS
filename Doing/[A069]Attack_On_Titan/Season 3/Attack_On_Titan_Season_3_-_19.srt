[HANGE] It almost feels like
a laboratory down here.

183
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,208
[EREN]
My dad was a doctor,

184
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,500
so he was always cooped up
down here mixing medicines.

185
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,333
[HANGE]
That makes sense.

186
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:48,375
Actually, if we assume that all
of this is labeled accurately,

187
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,208
most of it seems to
be widely available.

188
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,791
And all of the books on
hand relate to medicine.

189
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,625
This looks like a
normal doctor's study.

190
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,875
There isn't a single thing here
that would rouse my suspicion,

191

as I'm sure your
father intended.

192
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,791
Right.

193
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,541
If you wanna hide something
from the Interior Police,

194
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,250
you wanna be sure not
to give them any leads.

195

Hey.

there, get to work.

197

Erwin's hunches

00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,083

peppermint oil and charcoal.

Guess he was using these to
ward off moisture and bugs.

00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,291
If what we were looking for
exists, then we've found it.

After all this time,

explain himself.

Then Erwin raised his hand

218
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,958
and asked the
strangest question.

219
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,083
"How can we be sure
there aren't other humans

220

living far away from the walls?"

221
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,083
His thinking was that since
we'd never been able to

222
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,166
search freely beyond the walls,

223
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,666
we had no way of confirming
that the rest of humanity

224
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,750
had been wiped out
by Titans completely.

225
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:34,041
[ERWIN] And yet, that's exactly
what our historians would claim.

00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,416

Hmm?

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,750
[ERWIN]
Think.

228
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,541
If our history books
would claim to be unbiased,

229
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,916
the phrasing should be

230
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,666
"it's believed that the
rest of mankind was killed."

231
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,083
If I'm being honest,

232
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,958
I feel like you're just
splitting hairs here.

233
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,125
I'm not!

234
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,375
This was a deliberate
choice they made!

235
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,958
These books--

They're commissioned and issued
by the royal government itself.

Get it?

238
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,416
Their intent is to
make us believe

we're the only humans left.

240
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,541
Maybe they just assumed.

Aren't you reading a
little too far into this?
